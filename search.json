    "text": "2.1 Occurrence of Plasma in Nature\nIt is now believed that the universe is made of 69% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 1% normal matter. All that we can see in the sky is the part of normal matter that is in the plasma state, emitting radiation. Plasma in physics, not to be confused with blood plasma, is an “ionized” gas in which at least one of the electrons in an atom has been stripped free, leaving a positively charged nucleus, called an ion. Sometimes plasma is called the “fourth state of matter”. When a solid is heated, it becomes a liquid. Heating a liquid turns it into a gas. Upon further heating, the gas is ionized into a plasma. Since a plasma is made of ions and electrons, which are charged, electric fields are rampant everywhere, and particles “collide” not just when they bump into one another, but even at a distance where they can feel their electric fields. Hydrodynamics, which describes the flow of water through pipes, say, or the flow around boats in yacht races, or the behavior of airplane wings, is already a complicated subject. Adding the electric fields of a plasma greatly expands the range of possible motions, especially in the presence of magnetic fields.\nPlasma usually exists only in a vacuum. Otherwise, air will cool the plasma so that the ions and electrons will recombine into normal neutral atoms. In the laboratory, we need to pump the air out of a vacuum chamber. In the vacuum of space, however, much of the gas is in the plasma state, and we can see it. Stellar interiors and atmospheres, gaseous nebulas, and entire galaxies can be seen because they are in the plasma state. On earth, however, our atmosphere limits our experience with plasmas to a few examples: the flash of a lightning bolt, the soft glow of the Aurora Borealis, the light of a fluorescent tube, or the pixels of a plasma TV. We live in a small part of the universe where plasmas do not occur naturally; otherwise, we would not be alive.\nThe reason for this can be seen from the Saha equation, which tells us the amount of ionization to be expected in a gas in thermal equilibrium: \\[\n\\frac{n_i}{n_n}\\approx 2.4\\times 10^{21}\\frac{T^{3/2}}{n_i} e^{-\\frac{U_i}{k_B T}}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nHere \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_n\\) are, respectively, the density (number per \\(\\text{m}^3\\)) of ionized atoms and of neutral atoms, T is the gas temperature in Kelvin, \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann’s constant, and \\(U_i\\) is the ionization energy of the gas — that is, the number of joules required to remove the outermost electron from an atom. For ordinary air at room temperature, we may take \\(n_n\\approx 3\\times 10^{25}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\), \\(T\\approx 300\\, \\text{K}\\), and \\(U_i = 14.5\\,\\text{eV}\\) (for nitrogen), where \\(1\\,\\text{eV} = 1.6\\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{J}\\). The fractional ionization \\(n_i/(n_n + n_i) \\approx n_i/n_n\\) is ridiculously low: \\[\n\\frac{n_i}{n_n}\\approx 10^{-122}\n\\]\nAs the temperature is raised, the degree of ionization remains low until \\(U_i\\) is only a few times \\(k_B T\\). Then \\(n_i/n_e\\) rises abruptly, and the gas is in a plasma state. Further increase in temperature makes \\(n_n\\) less than \\(n_i\\), and the plasma eventually becomes fully ionized. This is the reason plasmas exist in astronomical bodies with temperatures of millions of degrees, but not on the earth. Life could not easily coexist with a plasma — at least, plasma of the type we are talking about. The natural occurrence of plasmas at high temperatures is the reason for the designation “the fourth state of matter”.\nAlthough we do not intend to emphasize the Saha equation, we should point out its physical meaning. Atoms in a gas have a spread of thermal energies, and an atom is ionized when, by chance, it suffers a collision of high enough energy to knock out an electron. In a cold gas, such energetic collisions occur infrequently, since an atom must be accelerated to much higher than the average energy by a series of “favorable” collisions. The exponential factor in Equation 2.1 expresses the fact that the number of fast atoms falls exponentially with \\(U_i/k_BT\\). Once an atom is ionized, it remains charged until it meets an electron; it then very likely recombines with the electron to become neutral again. The recombination rate clearly depends on the density of electrons, which we can take as equal to \\(n_i\\). ni. The equilibrium ion fraction, therefore, should decrease with \\(n_i\\); and this is the reason for the factor \\(ni^{-1}\\) on the right-hand side of Equation 2.1. The plasma in the interstellar medium owes its existence to the low value of \\(n_i\\) (about 1 per \\(\\text{cm}^3\\)), and hence the low recombination rate.",

    "section": "2.2 Definition of Plasma",
    "text": "2.2 Definition of Plasma\nAny ionized gas cannot be called a plasma, of course; there is always some small degree of ionization in any gas. A useful definition is as follows:\nA plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior.\nWe must now define “quasineutral” and “collective behavior”. The meaning of quasineutrality will be made clear in Sect. 1.4 LINK?. What is meant by “collective behavior” is as follows.\nConsider the forces acting on a molecule of, say, ordinary air. Since the molecule is neutral, there is no net electromagnetic force on it, and the force of gravity is negligible. The molecule moves undisturbed until it makes a collision with another molecule, and these collisions control the particle’s motion. A macroscopic force applied to a neutral gas, such as from a loudspeaker generating sound waves, is transmitted to the individual atoms by collisions. The situation is totally different in a plasma, which has charged particles. As these charges move around, they can generate local concentrations of positive or negative charge, which give rise to electric fields. Motion of charges also generates currents, and hence magnetic fields. These fields affect the motion of other charged particles far away.\nLet us consider the effect on each other of two slightly charged regions of plasma separated by a distance \\(r\\). ADD FIGURE! The Coulomb force between A and B diminishes as \\(1/r^2\\). However, for a given solid angle (that is, \\(\\Delta r/r =\\) constant), the volume of plasma in B that can affect A increases as \\(r^3\\). Therefore, elements of plasma exert a force on one another even at large distances. It is this long-ranged Coulomb force that gives the plasma a large repertoire of possible motions and enriches the field of study known as plasma physics. In fact, the most interesting results concern so-called “collisionless” plasmas, in which the long-range electromagnetic forces are so much larger than the forces due to ordinary local collisions that the latter can be neglected altogether. By “collective behavior” we mean motions that depend not only on local conditions but on the state of the plasma in remote regions as well.\nThe word “plasma” seems to be a misnomer. It comes from the Greek πλάσμα, ατoς, τo, which means something molded or fabricated. Because of collective behavior, a plasma does not tend to conform to external influences; rather, it often behaves as if it had a mind of its own.",

    "section": "2.3 Concept of Temperature",
    "text": "2.3 Concept of Temperature\nBefore proceeding further, it is important to review and extend our physical notions of “temperature”. A gas in thermal equilibrium has particles of all velocities, and the most probable distribution of these velocities is known as the Maxwellian distribution. For simplicity, consider a gas in which the particles can move only in one dimension. (This is not entirely frivolous; a strong magnetic field, for instance, can constrain electrons to move only along the field lines.) The one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution is given by \\[\nf(v) = A \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}mv^2/k_B T \\right)\n\\tag{2.2}\\] where \\(f\\mathrm{d}u\\) is the number of particles per \\(\\text{m}^3\\) with velocity between \\(u\\) and \\(u+\\mathrm{d}u\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}mu^2\\) is the kinetic energy, and \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann’s constant. The density \\(n\\), or number of particles per \\(\\text{m}^3\\), is given by \\[\nn = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(v)\\mathrm{d}v\n\\]\nThe constant \\(A\\) is related to the density \\(n\\) by \\[\nA = n\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThe width of the distribution is characterized by the constant \\(T\\), which we call the temperature. To see the exact meaning of \\(T\\), we can compute the average kinetic energy of particles in this distribution: \\[\nE_\\text{av} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2}mv^2f(v)\\mathrm{d}v}{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(v)\\mathrm{d}v}\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nDefining \\(y=v/v_\\text{t}\\) and \\[\nv_\\text{t} = \\left( 2k_B T/m \\right)^{1/2}\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nwe can write Equation 2.2 as \\[\nf(v) = A \\exp(-v^2/v_\\text{t}^2)\n\\] and Equation 2.3 as \\[\nE_\\text{av} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mA v_\\text{t}^3 \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty [\\exp(-y^2)]y^2\\mathrm{d}y}{A v_\\text{t}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty [\\exp(-y^2)]\\mathrm{d}y}\n\\]\nThe integral in the numerator is integrable by parts: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty y\\cdot[\\exp(-y^2)]y\\mathrm{d}y &= \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}[\\exp(-y^2)]y \\right]_{-\\infty}^\\infty -\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty -\\frac{1}{2}[\\exp(-y^2)]\\mathrm{d}y \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty [\\exp(-y^2)]\\mathrm{d}y\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCanceling the integrals, we have \\[\nE_\\text{av} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mA v_\\text{t}^3\\frac{1}{2}}{A v_\\text{t}} = \\frac{1}{4}m v_\\text{t}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T\n\\]\nThus the average kinetic energy is \\(\\frac{1}{2}k_B T\\).\nIt is easy to extend this result to three dimensions. Maxwell’s distribution is then \\[\nf(v_x, v_y, v_z) = A_3 \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)/k_B T \\right]\n\\] where \\[\nA_3 = n\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T} \\right)^{3/2}\n\\]\nBecause a Maxwellian distribution is isotropic (i.e. the form is symmetric in \\(v_x,v_y,\\) and \\(v_z\\)), we can separate each dimension. The average kinetic energy is then 3 times the single dimension result \\[\nE_\\text{av} = \\frac{3}{2}k_B T\n\\]\nThe general result is that \\(E_\\text{av}\\) equals \\(\\frac{1}{2}k_B T\\) per degree of freedom.\nSince \\(T\\) and \\(E_\\text{av}\\) are so closely related, it is customary in plasma physics to give temperatures in units of energy. To avoid confusion on the number of dimensions involved, it is not \\(E_\\text{av}\\) but the energy corresponding to \\(k_B T\\) that is used to denote the temperature. For \\(k_B T = 1\\,\\text{eV}=1.6\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}\\), we have \\[\nT = \\frac{q}{k_B} = 11600\n\\]\nThus the conversion factor is \\[\n1\\,\\text{eV} = 11600\\,\\text{K}\n\\]\nBy a 2-eV plasma we mean that \\(k_B T=2\\,\\text{eV}\\), or \\(E_\\text{av}=3\\,\\text{eV}\\) in three dimensions.\nIt is interesting that a plasma can have several temperatures at the same time. It often happens that the ions and the electrons have separate Maxwellian distributions with different temperatures \\(T_i\\) and \\(T_e\\). This can come about because the collision rate among ions or among electrons themselves is larger than the rate of collisions between an ion and an electron. Then each species can be in its own thermal equilibrium, but the plasma may not last long enough for the two temperatures to equalize. When there is a magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), even a single species, say ions, can have two temperatures. This is because the forces acting on an ion along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are different from those acting perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (due to the Lorentz force). The components of velocity perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) may then belong to different Maxwellian distributions with temperatures \\(T_\\perp\\) and \\(T_\\parallel\\).\nBefore leaving our review of the notion of temperature, we should dispel the popular misconception that high temperature necessarily means a lot of heat. People are usually amazed to learn that the electron temperature inside a fluorescent light bulb is about \\(20000\\, \\text{K}\\). “My, it doesn’t feel that hot!” Of course, the heat capacity must also be taken into account. The density of electrons inside a fluorescent tube is much less than that of a gas at atmospheric pressure, and the total amount of heat transferred to the wall by electrons striking it at their thermal velocities is not that great. For example, the temperature of a cigarette ash is high enough to cause a burn, but the total amount of heat involved is not. Many laboratory plasmas have temperatures of the order of \\(1,000,000\\,\\text{K}\\) (\\(100\\,\\text{eV}\\)), but at densities of only \\(10^{18}-10^{19}\\) per \\(\\text{m}^3\\), the heating of the walls is not a serious consideration.",

    "section": "2.4 Debye Shielding",
    "text": "2.4 Debye Shielding\n(Problem 4 on P27 (Bellan 2008))\nA fundamental characteristic of the behavior of plasma is its ability to shield out electric potentials that are applied to it. Suppose we tried to put an electric field inside a plasma by inserting two charged balls connected to a battery (Fig. 1.3 ADD IT!). The balls would attract particles of the opposite charge, and almost immediately a cloud of ions would surround the negative ball and a cloud of electrons would surround the positive ball. (We assume that a layer of dielectric keeps the plasma from actually recombining on the surface, or that the battery is large enough to maintain the potential in spite of this.) If the plasma were cold and there were no thermal motions, there would be just as many charges in the cloud as in the ball, the shielding would be perfect, and no electric field would be present in the body of the plasma outside of the clouds. On the other hand, if the temperature is finite, those particles that are at the edge of the cloud, where the electric field is weak, have enough thermal energy to escape from the electrostatic potential well. The “edge” of the cloud then occurs at the radius where the potential energy is approximately equal to the thermal energy \\(k_BT\\) of the particles, and the shielding is not complete. Potentials of the order of \\(k_BT/e\\) can leak into the plasma and cause finite electric fields to exist there.\nLet us compute the approximate thickness of such a charge cloud. Let us put a point charge \\(q_T\\) into a quasi-neutral gas of charged particles. The gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with ion and electron temperatures \\(T_e\\) and \\(T_i\\) (They are not necessarily the same, and in fact, quite different in nature.). (ADD FIGURE!) We wish to compute \\(\\phi(x)\\). For simplicity, we assume that the ion-electron mass ratio \\(M/m\\) is infinite, so that the ions do not move but form a uniform background of positive charge. To be more precise, we can say that \\(M/m\\) is large enough that the inertia of the ions prevents them from moving significantly on the time scale of the experiment.\nMaxwell distribution: \\[\nf(\\mathbf{v})=n_0\\Big( \\frac{m}{2\\pi kT}\\Big)^{3/2}\\exp\\Big( -\\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\\Big)\n\\]\nIn the presence of a potential energy \\(q\\phi\\)m the distribution function follows the Boltzmann distribution: \\[\nf(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v})=n_0\\Big( \\frac{m}{2\\pi kT}\\Big)^{3/2}\\exp\\Big( -\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2+q\\phi(\\mathbf{x})}{kT}\\Big)\n\\]\nIt would not be worthwhile to prove this here. What this equation says is intuitively obvious: There are fewer particles at places where the potential energy is large, since not all particles have enough energy to get there.\nNote that the concept of temperature is valid in LTE. From the Boltzmann equation, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}+\\nabla_x\\cdot(f\\mathbf{v})+\\nabla_v\\cdot(f\\mathbf{a})=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla_x f+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot\\nabla_v f=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we neglect the time derivatives, we obtain \\[\n(\\mathbf{v}_j\\cdot\\nabla)f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v}_j)+\\big[-\\frac{1}{m_j}\\nabla(q_j\\phi)\\cdot\\nabla_v\\big]f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v}_j)=0\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nThe LTE distribution is in a Maxwellian shape, \\[\nf(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v}_j)=n_j(\\mathbf{r})\\Big( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_BT}\\Big)^{3/2}\\exp\\Big( -\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}\\Big)\n\\]\nSubstitute into Equation 2.5, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\mathbf{v}_j\\cdot\\nabla)n_j +\\frac{\\mathbf{v}_j\\cdot\\nabla(q\\phi)}{k_BT_j}n_j=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow n_j(\\mathbf{r}) = n_{j0} \\exp\\Big[ -\\frac{q_j\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r})}{k_BT_j} \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen we get the Boltzmann distribution of each species with a separate temperature for each.\nConsider a uniform plasma with \\(n_i=n_{i0}e^{-e\\phi/k_B T_i}\\), \\(n_e=n_{e0}e^{e\\phi/k_BT_e}\\), and with the quasi-neutral assumption, \\(n_{e0}=n_{i0}=n_0\\). Introduce a point charge \\(q_T\\) in the initially neutralized plasma. Poisson equation gives \\[\n\\nabla^2 \\phi=-\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}=-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\Big[ e(n_e-n_i) +q_T \\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\Big]\n\\]\nDue to symmetry, \\(\\phi=\\phi(r)\\). When the temperature is high, \\(q\\phi(r)\\ll kT\\), the exponent is small and we can expand in a Taylor series and leave only the first order term. In spherical coordinates, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla^2\\phi=\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\Big( r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} \\Big)& \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\Big( r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} \\Big)+\\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0}\\Big( \\underbrace{ n_{e0}e^{e\\phi/k_BT_e} - n_{i0}e^{-e\\phi/k_B T_i} }_{\\approx n_0\\big[ e\\phi/k_BT_e +e\\phi/k_BT_i  \\big]}\\Big)&= -\\frac{q_T}{\\epsilon_0}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\Big( r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} \\Big) -\\underbrace{\\frac{e^2n_0}{\\epsilon_0}\\Big( \\frac{1}{k_B T_e}+\\frac{1}{k_BT_i}\\Big) }_{ \\frac{1}{{\\lambda_D}^2}\\equiv \\frac{1}{{\\lambda_{Di}}^2}+\\frac{1}{{\\lambda_{De}}^2}}\\phi&=-\\frac{q_T}{\\epsilon_0}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\Big( r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} \\Big) -\\frac{1}{{\\lambda_D}^2}\\phi&=-\\frac{q_T}{\\epsilon_0}\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\[\n\\lambda_D=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_BT^\\ast}{n_0e^2}}\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nis the Debye length, \\(T^\\ast=\\Big( \\frac{1}{T_e}+\\frac{1}{T_i} \\Big)^{-1}\\). The Debye length, is a measure of the shielding distance or thickness of the sheath. Note that larger density indicates better shielding effects, as one would expect, since each layer of plasma contains more electrons. Furthermore, \\(\\lambda_D\\) increases with increasing \\(k_B T^\\ast\\). Without thermal agitation, the charge cloud would collapse to an infinitely thin layer. Finally, most commonly it is the electron temperature (\\(T^\\ast\\approx T_e\\)) which is used in the definition of \\(\\lambda_D\\) because the electrons, being more mobile than the ions, generally do the shielding by moving so as to create a surplus or deficit of negative charge. Only in special situations is this not true.\nFor \\(r&gt;0\\) (away from the charge), \\[\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\Big( r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} \\Big) -\\frac{1}{{\\lambda_D}^2}\\phi=0\n\\]\nLet \\(\\phi(r)=\\frac{F(r)}{r}\\), we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2F}{\\mathrm{d}r^2}-\\frac{F}{{\\lambda_D}^2}&=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow F&=Ae^{-r/\\lambda_D}+\\cancel{Be^{r/\\lambda_D}} (r&gt;0) \\nonumber \\\\\n&=Ae^{-r/\\lambda_D}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAnticipate when \\(r\\rightarrow 0\\), \\(\\phi(r)\\rightarrow \\frac{q_T}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}\\approx \\frac{A}{r}\\). So \\[\n\\phi(r)=\\frac{q_t}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r}e^{-r/\\lambda_D}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Electric potential.\n\n\n\nThe electric potential drops very quickly (Figure 2.1). In other words, if you insert a charge into a neutral plasma, its potential will only effect within a small range. Recall the Gauss’s law, \\[\n\\oint\\mathbf{E}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}=\\frac{Q_T}{\\epsilon_0}\\rightarrow\\textrm{ as }R\\rightarrow \\infty, \\textrm{ E goes to zero.}\n\\]\nThe following are useful forms of Equation 2.6: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda_D &= 69 (T_e/n)^{1/2}\\,\\text{m},\\quad T_e\\,\\text{in K} \\\\\n\\lambda_D &= 7430 (k_B T_e/n)^{1/2}\\,\\text{m},\\quad k_BT_e\\,\\text{in eV}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe are now in a position to define “quasineutrality.” If the dimensions \\(L\\) of a system are much larger than \\(\\lambda_D\\), then whenever local concentrations of charge arise or external potentials are introduced into the system, these are shielded out in a distance short compared with \\(L\\), leaving the bulk of the plasma free of large electric potentials or fields. Outside of the sheath on the wall or on an obstacle, \\(\\nabla^2\\phi\\) is very small, and \\(n_i\\) is equal to \\(n_e\\). It takes only a small charge imbalance to give rise to potentials of the order of \\(k_BT/e\\). The plasma is “quasineutral”; that is, neutral enough so that one can take \\(n_i\\simeq n_e\\simeq n\\), where \\(n\\) is a common density called the plasma density, but not so neutral that all the interesting electromagnetic forces vanish. Plasma may be considered neutral over a length scale larger than Debye length.\nAdditional comments:\n\nPlasma acts like dielectron.\nThere is a plasma sheath near to where materials contact, inside which charge neutrality is violated. This will be discussed in Section 17.1.",

    "text": "2.6 Plasma Frequency\nBesides the length scale, we are also interested in time scale. The plasma frequency, \\[\n\\omega_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{n\\,e^2}{\\epsilon_0\\,m}}\n\\tag{2.7}\\] is the most fundamental time-scale in plasma physics. Clearly, there is a different plasma frequency for each species. However, the relatively fast electron frequency is, by far, the most important, and references to “the plasma frequency” in most textbooks invariably mean the electron plasma frequency.\n\\(\\omega_p\\) corresponds to the typical electrostatic oscillation frequency of a given species in response to a small charge separation. For instance, consider a one-dimensional situation in which a slab consisting entirely of one charge species is displaced from its quasi-neutral position by an infinitesimal distance \\(\\delta x\\). The resulting charge density which develops on the leading face of the slab is \\(\\sigma=e\\,n\\,\\delta x\\). An equal and opposite charge density develops on the opposite face. The \\(x\\)-directed electric field generated inside the slab is of magnitude \\(E_x= -\\sigma/\\epsilon_0 =- e\\,n\\,\\delta x/\\epsilon_0\\). Thus, Newton’s law applied to an individual particle inside the slab yields \\[\nm\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\delta x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = e\\,E_x = -m\\,\\omega_p^{~2}\\,\\delta x\n\\] giving \\(\\delta x = \\delta x_0\\,\\cos\\omega_p t\\).\nPlasma frequency is closely associated with plasma oscillation and waves. A more thorough derivation is given in Section 10.4. Note that plasma oscillations will only be observed if the plasma system is studied over time periods \\(\\tau\\) longer than the plasma period \\(\\tau_p\\equiv 1/\\omega_p\\), and if external actions change the system at a rate no faster than \\(\\omega_p\\). In the opposite case, one is clearly studying something other than plasma physics (e.g., nuclear reactions), and the system cannot not usefully be considered to be a plasma. Likewise, observations over length-scales \\(L\\) shorter than the distance \\(v_t\\,\\tau_p\\) traveled by a typical plasma particle during a plasma period will also not detect plasma behaviour. In this case, particles will exit the system before completing a plasma oscillation. This distance, which is the spatial equivalent to \\(\\tau_p\\), is called the Debye length, and takes the form \\[\n\\lambda_D \\equiv \\sqrt{T/m}\\,\\,\\omega_p^{-1}.\n\\]\nNote that \\[\n\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0\\,T}{n\\,e^2}}\n\\] is independent of mass, and therefore generally comparable for different species. Clearly, our idealized system can only usefully be considered to be a plasma provided that \\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_D}{L} \\ll 1\n\\tag{2.8}\\] and \\[\n\\frac{\\tau_p}{\\tau}\\ll 1\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\tau\\) and \\(L\\) represent the typical time-scale and length-scale of the process under investigation. It should be noted that, despite the conventional requirement Equation 2.8, plasma physics is capable of considering structures on the Debye scale. The most important example of this is the Debye sheath: i.e., the boundary layer which surrounds a plasma confined by a material surface.\nLet \\(V_A=B/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}\\) be the Alfvén speed and \\(\\omega_{c}=q\\, B/m\\) be the ion gyro-frequency. We have this convenient relation \\[\n\\frac{\\omega_p}{\\omega_{c}} = \\frac{c}{V_A}\n\\tag{2.9}\\]",

In practice, an analytic function is usually defined by means of some mathematical expression — such as a polynomial, an infinite series, or an integral. Ordinarily, there is some region within which the expression is meaningful and does yield an analytic function. Outside this region, the expression may cease to be meaningful, and the question then arises as to whether or not there is any way of extending the definition of the function so that this “extended” function is analytic over a larger region. A simple example is given as follows.\nEx.1 Polynomial series\n\\[\nf(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n\n\\]\nwhich describes an analytic function for \\(|z|&lt;1\\) but which diverges for \\(|z|&gt;1\\). However, the function\n\\[\ng(z)=\\frac{1}{1-z}\n\\]\nis analytic over the whole plane (except at \\(z=1\\)), and it coincides with \\(f(z)\\) inside the unit circle.\nSuch a function \\(g(z)\\), which coincides with a given analytic \\(f(z)\\) over that region for which \\(f(z)\\) is defined by which also is analytic over some extension of that region, is said to be an analytic continuation of \\(f(z)\\). It is useful to think of \\(f(z)\\) and \\(g(z)\\) as being the same function and to consider that the formula defining \\(f(z)\\) failed to provide the values of \\(f(z)\\) in the extended region because of some defect in the mode of description rather than because of some limitation inherent in \\(f(z)\\) itself.

    "text": "3.7 Toroidal and Poloidal Decomposition\nThe earliest use of these terms cited by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is by Walter M. Elsasser (1946) in the context of the generation of the Earth’s magnetic field by currents in the core, with “toroidal” being parallel to lines of latitude and “poloidal” being in the direction of the magnetic field (i.e. towards the poles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Toroidal-Poloidal Decomposition.\n\n\n\nThe OED also records the later usage of these terms in the context of toroidally confined plasmas, as encountered in magnetic confinement fusion. In the plasma context, the toroidal direction is the long way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by z in the slab approximation or \\(\\zeta\\) or \\(\\phi\\) in magnetic coordinates; the poloidal direction is the short way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by y in the slab approximation or \\(\\theta\\) in magnetic coordinates. (The third direction, normal to the magnetic surfaces, is often called the “radial direction”, denoted by x in the slab approximation and variously \\(\\psi\\), \\(\\chi\\), r, \\(\\rho\\), or \\(s\\) in magnetic coordinates.)\nIn vector calculus, a topic in pure and applied mathematics, a poloidal–toroidal decomposition is a restricted form of the Helmholtz decomposition. It is often used in the spherical coordinates analysis of solenoidal vector fields, for example, magnetic fields and incompressible fluids.\nFor a three-dimensional vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) with zero divergence\n\\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F}=0\n\\]\nThis \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) can be expressed as the sum of a toroidal field \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and poloidal vector field \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{T}+\\mathbf{P}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\widehat{r}\\) is a radial vector in spherical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\phi)\\). The toroidal field is obtained from a scalar field, \\(\\psi(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) as the following curl,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{T}=\\nabla\\times(\\widehat{r}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}))\n\\]\nand the poloidal field is derived from another scalar field \\(\\phi(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) as a twice-iterated curl,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}=\\nabla\\times\\nabla\\times(\\widehat{r}\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}))\n\\]\nThis decomposition is symmetric in that the curl of a toroidal field is poloidal, and the curl of a poloidal field is toroidal. The poloidal–toroidal decomposition is unique if it is required that the average of the scalar fields \\(\\Psi\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) vanishes on every sphere of radius \\(r\\).",

The general complex solution of Laplace equation in spherical coordinates is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV(\\mathbf{r}) &= \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=-l}^{l} \\left( A_l r^l + B_l r^{-l-1} \\right)P_l^m(\\cos\\theta)e^{-im\\phi} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=-l}^{l} \\left( A_l r^l + B_l r^{-l-1} \\right) Y_l^m(\\theta, \\phi)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\[\nY_l^m(\\theta,\\phi) = P_l^m(\\cos{\\theta})e^{-im\\phi}\n\\] are the (complex) spherical harmonics. The indices l and m indicate degree and order of the function. The general real solution is \\[\nV(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=0}^{l} \\left( A_l r^l + B_l r^{-l-1} \\right)P_l^m(\\cos\\theta)\\left[ S_m\\sin{m\\phi} + C_m\\cos{m\\phi} \\right]\n\\]\n\\(P_l^m\\) are the associated Legendre polynomials. The first three terms of \\(P_l^m(\\cos\\theta)\\) are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_0^0(\\cos\\theta) &= 1 \\\\\nP_1^0(\\cos\\theta) &= \\cos\\theta \\\\\nP_1^1(\\cos\\theta) &= -\\sin\\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThere are two parts in the real solution. The first part, starting with coefficients \\(A_l\\), represents the potential from an exterior source, which is analytic at \\(r=0\\) but diverges as \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). The second part, starting with coefficients \\(B_l\\), represents the potential from an interior source, which is singular at \\(r=0\\) and finite as \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\).\nEx 1. Planet dipole field\nFor a planetary dipole field, we only consider the contribution from the internal source. The Gauss potential for the dipole reads \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV &= \\frac{1}{r^2}\\big[ B_1C_0\\cos\\theta + B_1C_1\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta + B_1S_1\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta \\big] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{r^2}\\big[ G_{10}\\cos\\theta + G_{11}\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta + H_{11}\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta \\big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf \\(r\\) is defined in the unit of planet radius, then the dipole moment \\(\\mathbf{m} = (G_{11},H_{11},G_{10})\\) in Cartesian coordinates would have the SI unit of \\([\\text{T}\\text{m}^3]\\). We then have \\[\n\\mathbf{B} = -\\nabla V = -\\nabla \\Big[ \\frac{\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}{r^3} \\Big] = \\frac{3(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\widehat{r})\\widehat{r}-\\mathbf{m}}{r^3}\n\\]\nOften in literature we see dipole moments in the unit of \\([\\text{nT}]\\,[\\text{R}]^3\\): this indicates that this dipole strength is equivalent to the equatorial field strength \\(B_{\\text{eq}}\\) at the planet’s surface, and the field strength is scaled as \\(r^{-3}\\).\nIn SI units, we need to append additional coefficients \\[\n\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{3(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\widehat{r})\\widehat{r}-\\mathbf{m}}{r^3}\n\\] such that the dipole moment \\(\\mathbf{m}\\) has the unit of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\,[\\mathrm{m}]^2\\), consistent with its physical meaning originated from a closed current loop.\nIn spherical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\varphi)\\) aligned with the dipole moment, \\[\n\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{m}{r^3} (-2\\cos\\theta, -\\sin\\theta, \\,0)\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nIt is usually convenient to work in terms of the latitude, \\(\\vartheta = \\pi/2 - \\theta\\), rather than the polar angle, \\(\\theta\\). An individual magnetic field-line satisfies the equation \\[\nr = r_\\mathrm{eq}\\,\\cos^2\\vartheta\n\\] where \\(r_\\mathrm{eq}\\) is the radial distance to the field line in the equatorial plane (\\(\\vartheta=0^\\circ\\)). It is conventional to label field lines using the L-shell parameter, \\(L=r_\\mathrm{eq}/R_E\\). Here, \\(R_E = 6.37\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) is the Earth’s radius. Thus, the variation of the magnetic field-strength along a field line characterized by a given \\(L\\)-value is \\[\nB = \\frac{B_E}{L^3} \\frac{(1+3\\,\\sin^2\\vartheta)^{1/2}}{\\cos^6\\vartheta}\n\\] where \\(B_E= \\mu_0 M_E/(4\\pi\\, R_E^{~3}) = 3.11\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{T}\\) is the equatorial magnetic field-strength on the Earth’s surface.\nIn Cartesian representation, \\[\n\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{1}{r^5}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(3x^2-r^2) & 3xy & 3xz \\\\\n3yx & (3y^2-r^2) & 3yz \\\\\n3zx & 3zy & (3z^2-r^2)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{m}\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nNote that \\((x,y,z)\\) and \\(r\\) are all normalized to the radius of the planet \\(R\\).\nEx 2. 2D dipole field\nLet us consider the solution to the Laplace equation in polar coordinates \\((r, \\theta)\\). Via separation of variable it can be shown that the general real solution takes the form \\[\nV = c_0\\ln{r} + D_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left( A_n\\cos{n\\theta} + B_n\\sin{n\\theta} \\right)\\left( C_n r^n + D_n r^{-n} \\right)\n\\]\nFor a dipole field, we only consider \\(n=1\\) from the internal source. If we absorb \\(D_1\\) into \\(A_1\\) and \\(B_1\\), we have \\[\nV = (A_1\\cos\\theta + B_1\\sin\\theta)\\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}{r^2}\n\\] where the 2D magnetic moment is \\(\\mathbf{m}=(A_1, B_1)\\).\nThus \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{dipole,2D} = -\\nabla V = \\frac{2(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\hat{r})\\hat{r} - \\mathbf{m}}{r^2}\n\\tag{3.8}\\] where the minus sign has been absorbed into the coefficients. 2D dipole scales as \\(r^{-2}\\).\nEx 3. Magnetic monopoles\nEven though magnetic monopoles have not yet been observed in nature, there are some nice math tricks that allow us to approximate the magnetic dipole field as two opposite charged magnetic monopoles sitting close to each other. In 3D, the magnetic monopole would give a magnetic field \\[\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{g}{r^2}\\hat{r}\n\\] where \\(g\\) is the strength of the magnetic monopole in units of magnetic charge. In 2D, it would be \\[\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}) = C\\frac{g}{r}\\hat{r}\n\\]\nThe analogy can be make from Coulomb’s law: an electric dipole field in 3D scales as \\(r^{-3}\\) when the electric monopole field scales as \\(r^{-2}\\).",

Equation 3.14, known as the Airy equation or Stokes equation, is the simplest second-order linear differential equation with a turning point (a point where the character of the solutions changes from oscillatory to exponential). From the WKBJ theory, we get the solution \\[\nE_{\\text{WKBJ}} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k(x)}}e^{\\pm i\\int^x k(x^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}x^\\prime}\n= \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\zeta^{-1/4}e^{\\mp\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}} & \\text{if } \\zeta &gt; 0 \\\\\n(-\\zeta)^{-1/4}e^{\\pm i \\frac{2}{3}(-\\zeta)^{3/2}} & \\text{if } \\zeta &lt; 0\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\nNote that the solution blows up at \\(\\zeta=0\\) (turning point) miserably. For \\(\\zeta&gt;0\\), one solution is exponentially decay while the other is exponentially growing; for \\(\\zeta&lt;0\\), the two solutions are oscillatory. Solutions can also be found as series in ascending powers of \\(\\zeta\\) by the standard method. Assume that a solution is \\(E=a_0+a_1\\zeta+a_2\\zeta^2+...\\) Substitute this in Stokes Equation and equate powers of \\(\\zeta\\) will give relations between the constants \\(a_0,a_1,a_2\\),etc., and lead finally to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE = &a_0\\Big\\{ 1+\\frac{\\zeta^3}{3\\cdot2} +\\frac{\\zeta^6}{6\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot2} + \\frac{\\zeta^9}{9\\cdot8\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot2} + ... \\Big\\} \\\\\n&+a_1\\Big\\{ \\zeta+\\frac{\\zeta^4}{4\\cdot3} +\\frac{\\zeta^7}{7\\cdot6\\cdot4\\cdot3} + \\frac{\\zeta^{10}}{10\\cdot9\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot4\\cdot3} + ...  \\Big\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which contains the two arbitrary constants \\(a_0\\) and \\(a_1\\), and is therefore the most general solution. The series are convergent for all \\(\\zeta\\), which confirms that every solution of Stokes Equation is finite, continuous and single valued.\nThis form is usually not easy to interpret in physical sense. Besides this, we can find a more useful solution to Equation 3.14 using the integral representation. An equivalent but maybe more intuitive approach is to solve Equation 3.14 with Fourier transform; a coefficient \\(2\\pi\\) naturally appears. Both approaches reach the same results.\nWrite \\[\nE(\\zeta) = \\int_a^b \\mathrm{d}t e^{t\\zeta} f(t)\n\\] where the integral represents a path in the complex t plane from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). Then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta^2} &= \\int_a^b \\mathrm{d}t\\ t^2 e^{t\\zeta} f(t) \\\\\n\\zeta E(\\zeta) &= \\int_a^b \\mathrm{d}t \\zeta e^{t\\zeta} f(t) = \\int_a^b \\mathrm{d}t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(e^{t\\zeta}) f(t) \\\\\n&=e^{t\\zeta} f(t) \\Big|_a^b -\\int_a^b dte^{t\\zeta} f^\\prime(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe limits \\(a,b\\) are be chosen so that the first term vanishes at both limits. Then Equation 3.14 is satisfied if\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\ne^{t\\zeta} f(t) \\Big|_a^b  = 0\\\\\nt^2 f(t) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} f(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\Rightarrow f(t) = Ae^{-\\frac{1}{3}t^3}\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is a constant. The solution is now written as\n\\[\nE(\\zeta) = \\int_a^b \\mathrm{d}t Ae^{t\\zeta-\\frac{1}{3}t^3}\n\\]\nThe limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must therefore be chosen so that \\(e^{t\\zeta-\\frac{1}{3}t^3}\\) is zero for both. (Note that \\(\\zeta\\) is a constant.) This is only possible if \\(t=\\infty\\) and the real part of \\(t^3\\) is positive:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Re(t^3) &gt; 0 \\Leftrightarrow 2\\pi n -\\frac{1}{2}\\pi &lt; \\arg{t^3} &lt; 2\\pi n + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow 2\\pi n -\\frac{1}{2}\\pi &lt; 3 \\arg{t} &lt; 2\\pi n + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is an integer. Figure 3.2 is a diagram of the complex t-plane, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must each be at \\(\\infty\\) in one of the shaded sectors. They cannot both be in the same sector, for then the integral would be zero. Hence the contour may be chosen in three ways, as shown by the three curves \\(C_1,C_2,C_3\\), and the solution would be\n\\[\nE(\\zeta) = \\int_{C_1,C_2,C_3} \\mathrm{d}t\\ e^{t\\zeta-\\frac{1}{3}t^3}\n\\]\nThis might appear at first to give three independent solutions, but the contour \\(C_1\\) and be distorted so as to coincide with the two contours \\(C_2+C_3\\), so that\n\\[\n\\int_{C_1} = \\int_{C_2} + \\int_{C_3}\n\\]\nand therefore there are only two independent solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Solution to Stokes Equation in complex t-plane.\n\n\n\nProof.\nNote that:\n\n\\(e^{A}\\neq 0\\ \\forall |A|&lt;\\infty\\);\n\\(e^{A}=0 \\Leftrightarrow\\, A\\rightarrow \\infty\\,\\text{and}\\,\\Re(A)&lt;0\\).\n\nTherefore we have\n\\[\ne^{-\\frac{1}{3}t^3}\\rightarrow 0\\,\\text{as}\\, t\\rightarrow \\infty\\,\\text{and}\\,\\Re\\Big(\\frac{1}{3}t^3\\Big)&gt;0\n\\] In polar coordinates, let \\(t=|t|e^{i\\theta}\\).

In Equation 3.15, the contour \\(C_1\\) can be distorted so as to coincide with the imaginary t-axis for almost its whole length. It must be displaced slightly to the left of this axis at its ends to remain in the shaded region at infinity. Let \\(t=is\\). Then the Airy function of the first kind in Equation 3.15 becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAi(\\zeta) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{i(\\zeta s+\\frac{1}{3}s^3)}ds \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\cos\\Big(\\zeta s+\\frac{1}{3}s^3\\Big)ds\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is known as the Airy integral, which is the solution for \\(y\\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(x\\rightarrow\\infty\\). The other linearly independent solution, the Airy function of the second kind, denoted \\(Bi(x)\\), is defined as the solution with the same amplitude of oscillation as \\(Ai(x)\\) as \\(x\\rightarrow -\\infty\\) which differs in phase by \\(\\pi/2\\):\n\\[\nBi(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\Big[e^{-\\frac{s^3}{3}+s\\zeta} + \\sin\\Big(\\zeta s+\\frac{1}{3}s^3\\Big)\\Big]ds\n\\]\n\\(Ai(x)\\) and \\(Bi(x)\\) are shown in ?fig-airy.\nKeyNotes.plot_airy()\nAs an interesting experiment, we can check if \\(Ai(x)\\) is recovered from solving the second order ODE numerically:\n@sco KeyNotes.plot_airy_ode()\nHere we start from the right boundary and move towards the left.\nNow, to find approximations for Airy functions, we use the method of steepest descent. This approximation is based on the assumption that major contribution to the integral is from near the saddle point. As an example of saddle point, consider a complex function \\(\\exp{f(z)}=e^{-z^2}\\), where \\(z=x+i y\\).\n\nIf \\(z=\\text{real} = x\\), \\(e^{-z^2}=e^{-x^2}\\);\nIf \\(z=\\text{imag}=iy\\), \\(e^{-z^2}=e^{y^2}\\).\n\nThe procedure goes as follows:\n\nDetour path of integral s.t. it passes through the saddle point of the integral, along the direction of steepest descent.\nObtain major contribution by integrating the Gaussian function.\n\n\\[\nI=\\int_C \\mathrm{d}t e^{f(t)},\\quad f(t) = f(t_s) + (t-t_s)f^\\prime(t_s) + \\frac{1}{2}(t-t_s)^2 f^{\\prime\\prime}(t_s) + ...\n\\] where \\(f^\\prime(t_s)=0\\) at the saddle point \\(t=t_s\\) simplifies \\(I\\) to the integral of a Gaussian function.\nFor \\(Ai(\\zeta)\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(t) &= t\\zeta -\\frac{1}{3}t^3 \\\\\nf^\\prime(t_s)& = \\zeta - {t_s}^2 = 0 \\\\\nf^{\\prime\\prime}(t_s)& = -2t_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConsider \\(\\zeta&gt;0\\) (where the solution is either exponentially decaying or growing.) Then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nt_{s1} = -\\sqrt{\\zeta},\\quad t_{s2} = \\sqrt{\\zeta} \\\\\nf(t_{s1}) = -\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2},\\quad f^{\\prime\\prime}(t_{s1}) = 2\\zeta^{1/2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] So \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAi(\\zeta) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{C_1} \\mathrm{d}t\\ e^{-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}+\\zeta^{1/2}(t-t_s)^2}+... \\\\\n&\\approx\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} e^{-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}}\\int_{C_1}\\mathrm{d}t\\ e^{\\sqrt{\\zeta}(t-t_s)^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet \\(e^{\\sqrt{\\zeta}(t-t_s)^2}=e^{-\\rho^2}\\), where \\(\\rho=\\text{real}\\) is the direction of steepest descent, and \\(\\rho=\\text{imag}\\) is the direction of steepest ascent.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni\\rho &= \\pm \\zeta^{1/4} (t-t_s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{d}t&=\\frac{i \\mathrm{d}\\rho}{\\zeta^{1/4}} \\Rightarrow\\ \\mathrm{d}t \\text{ is purely imaginary along steepest descent.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen for \\(\\zeta&gt;0\\) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAi(\\zeta) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}e^{-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{id\\rho}{\\zeta^{1/4}}e^{-\\rho^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta^{1/4}}e^{-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}} \\text{ as}\\ \\zeta\\rightarrow \\infty\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\nThe ratio of accuracy is shown in the following table (LABEL???).

For the region \\(x&gt;0\\), we first identify the exponentially decaying factor of the Airy function, \\(Ai(\\zeta)\\), to be the phase integral in the WKBJ solution:\n\\[\n-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2} = i \\int_0^x k(x^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}x^\\prime\n\\]\nNote that this yields \\(\\zeta=\\zeta(x)\\), a known function of x (I confuse myself later about \\(\\zeta\\) and \\(x\\)…). The branch for \\(\\zeta(x)\\) is to be chosen so that for \\(x&gt;0\\), \\(\\zeta\\) is real and positive.\nWe next verify that the uniformly valid solution to the standard equation is simply\n\\[\nE(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\zeta^\\prime(x)}}Ai(\\zeta)\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\nwhere the prime denotes a derivative. For large values of \\(\\zeta\\), we can use the asymptotic formula of \\(Ai\\) Equation 3.16, and notice that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\zeta^{1/2}\\zeta^\\prime = ik(x) \\\\\n\\zeta^\\prime(x) = -i \\frac{k(x)}{\\zeta^{1/2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwe can see that Equation 3.18 reduces to the standard WKBJ solutions for large values of \\(\\zeta\\)\n\\[\nE(x)= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\zeta^\\prime(x)}}Ai(\\zeta) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k(x)}} e^{-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k(x)}}e^{ i \\int_0^x k(x^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}x^\\prime}\n\\]\nWe can also show that Equation 3.18 is valid for small values of \\(\\zeta\\), i.e. near the turning point at \\(x=0\\). (Hint: Near \\(x=0\\), \\(k^2(x)\\) may be approximated by a linear function of \\(x\\). This linear approximation then yields \\(\\zeta(x)\\) as a linear function of \\(x\\) according to Equation 3.18.)\nEx. Choose a smooth plasma density profile which monotonically increases with \\(x\\) s.t.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x)}{\\omega^2} = 1 + \\tanh{x}\n\\]\nand launch a wave of frequency \\(\\omega\\) from \\(x=-\\infty\\), the vacuum region, toward the positive \\(x\\)-direction with \\(\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} = 10 \\text{m}^{-2}\\).

For the simple wave equation\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{dz^2} - E = 0\n\\]\nthe solution can be given in various forms\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE=e^z,e^{-z},\\cosh{z},\\sinh{z} \\\\\nE = \\cosh{z}=\\frac{1}{2}(e^z+e^{-z}) \\Rightarrow\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n&E\\sim\\frac{1}{2}e^z\\, z\\rightarrow\\infty \\\\\n&E\\sim\\frac{1}{2}e^{-z}\\, z\\rightarrow-\\infty\n\\end{array} \\right. \\\\\nE = \\sinh{z}=\\frac{1}{2}(e^z-e^{-z}) \\Rightarrow\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n&E\\sim\\frac{1}{2}e^z\\, z\\rightarrow\\infty \\\\\n&E\\sim\\frac{-1}{2}e^{-z}\\, z\\rightarrow-\\infty\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that if a solution is exponentially growing in one direction, its asymptotic solution can contain an arbitrary amount of the exponentially decaying solution; that is, specifying an asymptotic growing solution in one direction cannot completely specify the solution in the entire complex plane.\nThe two linearly independent approximate solutions to Airy Equation 3.14 are the Airy function approximations from WKBJ method:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta^2} - \\zeta E = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &E(\\zeta) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n&Ai(\\zeta)\\sim \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta^{1/4}}e^{-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}},\\quad \\zeta&gt;0 \\\\\n&Bi(\\zeta)\\sim \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta^{1/4}}e^{\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}},\\quad \\zeta&gt;0\n\\end{array} \\right. \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich is very accurate for \\(\\zeta&gt;3\\) (see previous section).\nStokes found that you can add an arbitrary amount of \\(Ai(\\zeta)\\) to \\(Bi(\\zeta)\\) without changing the behaviour of solution. (\\(Ai(\\zeta)&lt;O(\\zeta^{-1})\\)???)\nWe want to find \\(\\zeta\\) s.t. \\(E_{\\text{WKBJ}}\\) is purely growing/decaying exponentially:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\zeta^{3/2} \\text{is purely real} \\iff (|\\zeta|e^{i\\theta})^{3/2} \\text{is purely real} \\iff \\sin{\\frac{3}{2}\\theta} = 0,\\ \\theta=0,\\pm\\frac{2}{3}\\pi,\\pm\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe lines in the complex plane on which WKBJ solution is purely growing/decaying exponentially are called Stokes lines (Figure 3.4). It is accompanied with anti-Stokes lines (in the opposite direction to Stokes lines), on which WKBJ solution is purely oscillatory. The exponentially growing solution on Stokes lines is called the dominant solution; the decaying solution on Stokes lines is called the sub-dominant/recessive solution. The sub-dominant solution will always becomes dominant in a neighboring Stokes line. However, the inverse is not true. (It may contain an amount of sub-dominant solution.) Each term changes from dominant to subdominant, or the reverse, when \\(\\zeta\\) crosses an anti-Stokes line???\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines for WKBJ solution of Airy Equation.\n\n\n\nEven though we say “arbitrary”, the analytic solution in the whole complex plane possess a limit on that amount. The next question would be: how much exponentially decaying solution can you add to the exponentially growing solution? (Note that the asympotic series is also a divergent series: more terms don’t lead to high resolution accuracy! I have questions on this part???)\nFor the asymptotic approximation solution of Airy Equation 3.14, we need to define \\(\\arg(\\zeta)\\) properly to make it single value. Let us choose the branch cut \\(-\\pi\\le\\arg{\\zeta}&lt;\\pi\\). The complex plane is demonstrated in Figure 3.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Marked Stokes lines and regions for Airy solution.\n\n\n\nLet us start from region I.

(The former would be dominant on neighboring Stokes lines \\(S_2\\) and \\(S_3\\).)

The constant in the subdominant term has changed by \\(\\lambda_2 A_1\\) because the differential equation is linear, and it cannot depend on \\(B_1\\). Otherwise it would be unaltered if we added to the solution in region I any multiple of the solution in which \\(A_1=0\\). (See (Budden 1961) 15.13.)

In physical systems, however, some structure or other system usually constrains the body’s motion from taking certain directions and pathways. So a full set of Cartesian coordinates is often unneeded, as the constraints determine the evolving relations among the coordinates, which relations can be modeled by equations corresponding to the constraints. In the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, the constraints are incorporated into the motion’s geometry, reducing the number of coordinates to the minimum needed to model the motion.

    "text": "4.5 Hamilton-Lagrange Formalism of Lorentz Equation\nTwo mathematically equivalent formalisms describe charged particle dynamics, namely\n\nthe Lorentz equation \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\nHamiltonian-Lagrangian dynamics.\n\nThe two formalisms are complementary: the Lorentz equation is intuitive and suitable for approximate methods, whereas the more abstract Hamiltonian-Lagrangian formalism exploits time and space symmetries. A brief review of the Hamiltonian-Lagrangian formalism follows, emphasizing aspects relevant to dynamics of charged particles.\nThe starting point is to postulate the existence of a function \\(L\\), called the Lagrangian, which:\n\ncontains all information about the particle dynamics for a given situation;\ndepends only on generalized coordinates \\(Q_i(t),\\dot{Q}_i(t)\\) appropriate to the problem;\npossibly has an explicit dependence on time \\(t\\).\n\nIf such a function \\(L(Q_i(t), \\dot{Q}_i(t), t)\\) exists, then information on particle dynamics is retrieved by manipulation of the action integral \\[\nS = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(Q_i(t), \\dot{Q}_i(t), t) \\mathrm{d}t\n\\]\nThis manipulation is based on d’Alembert’s principle of least action. According to this principle, one considers the infinity of possible trajectories a particle could follow to get from its initial position \\(Q_{i}(t_1)\\) to its final position \\(Q_i(t_2)\\), and postulates that the trajectory actually followed is the one that results in the lowest value of \\(S\\). Thus, the value of \\(S\\) must be minimized (note that \\(S\\) here is action, and not entropy). Minimizing \\(S\\) does not give the actual trajectory directly, but rather gives equations of motion, which can be solved to give the actual trajectory.\nMinimizing \\(S\\) is accomplished by considering an arbitrary nearby alternative trajectory \\(Q_i(t)+\\delta Q_i(t)\\) having the same beginning and end points as the actual trajectory, i.e., \\(\\delta Q_i(t_1)=Q_i(t_2)=0\\). In order to make the variational argument more precise, \\(\\delta Q_i\\) is expressed as \\[\n\\delta Q_i(t) = \\epsilon \\eta_i(t)\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is an arbitrarily adjustable scalar assumed to be small so that \\(\\epsilon^2 &lt; \\epsilon\\) and \\(\\eta_i(t)\\) is a function of \\(t\\) that vanishes when \\(t=t_1\\) or \\(t=t_2\\) but is otherwise arbitrary. Calculating \\(\\delta S\\) to second order in \\(\\epsilon\\) gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta S &= \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(Q_i+\\delta Q_i, \\dot{Q}_i + \\delta\\dot{Q}_i, t) \\mathrm{d}t - \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(Q_i(t), \\dot{Q}_i(t), t) \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(Q_i+\\epsilon\\eta_i, \\dot{Q}_i + \\epsilon \\dot{\\eta}_i, t) \\mathrm{d}t - \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(Q_i(t), \\dot{Q}_i(t), t) \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\left( \\epsilon\\eta_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q_i} + \\frac{(\\epsilon \\eta_i)^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial Q_i^2} + \\epsilon \\dot{\\eta}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot{Q}_i} + \\frac{(\\epsilon\\dot{\\eta}_i)^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial\\dot{Q}_i^2} \\right)\\mathrm{d}t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSuppose the trajectory \\(Q_i(t)\\) is the one that minimizes \\(S\\). Any other trajectory must lead to a higher value of \\(S\\) and so \\(\\delta S\\) must be positive for any finite value of \\(\\epsilon\\). If \\(\\epsilon\\) is chosen to be sufficiently small, then the absolute values of the terms of order \\(\\epsilon^2\\) above will be smaller than the absolute values of the terms linear in \\(\\epsilon\\). The sign of \\(\\epsilon\\) could then be chosen to make \\(\\delta S\\) nagative, but this would violate the requirement that \\(\\delta S\\) must be positive. The only way out of this dilemma is to insist that the sum of the terms linear in \\(\\epsilon\\) vanishes so \\(\\delta S\\sim \\epsilon^2\\) and is therefore always positive as required. Insisting that the sum of terms linera in \\(\\epsilon\\) vanishes implies \\[\n0 = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\left( \\eta_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q_i} + \\dot{\\eta}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot{Q}_i} \\right)\\mathrm{d}t\n\\]\nUsing \\(\\dot{\\eta}_i = \\mathrm{d}\\eta_i/\\mathrm{d}t\\) the above expression may be integrated by parts to obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 &= \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\left( \\eta_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q_i} + \\dot{\\eta}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot{Q}_i} \\right)\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= \\left[ \\eta_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{Q}_i} \\right]_{t_1}^{t_2} + \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\left[ \\eta_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q_i} - \\eta_i\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{Q}_i} \\right) \\right]\\mathrm{d}t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\eta_i(t_{1,2})=0\\), the integrated term vanishes and since \\(\\eta_i\\) was an arbitrary function of \\(t\\), the coefficient of i in the integrand must vanish, yielding Lagrange’s equation \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q_i}\n\\tag{4.1}\\] where the canonical momentum \\(P_i\\) is defined as \\[\nP_i \\equiv \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot{Q}_i}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nLagrange’s equation shows that if \\(L\\) does not depend on a particular generalized coordinate \\(Q_j\\), then \\(\\mathrm{d}P_j/\\mathrm{d}t=0\\), in which case the canonical momentum \\(P_j\\) is a constant of motion; the coordinate \\(Q_j\\) is called a cyclic or ignorable coordinate. This is a very powerful and profound result. Saying that the Lagrangian function does not depend on a coordinate is equivalent to saying that the system is symmetric in that coordinate or translationally invariant with respect to that coordinate. The quantities \\(P_j\\) and \\(Q_j\\) are called conjugate and action has the dimensions of the product of these quantities.\nHamilton extended this formalism by introducing a new function related to the Lagrangian. This new function, called the Hamiltonian, provides further useful information and is defined as \\[\nH \\equiv \\left( \\sum_i P_i \\dot{Q}_i \\right) - L\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\nPartial derivative of \\(H\\) with respect to \\(P_i\\) and to \\(Q_i\\) give Hamilton’s equations \\[\n\\dot{Q}_i = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P_i},\\quad \\dot{P}_i = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial Q_i}\n\\] which are equations of motion having a close relation to phase-space concepts. The time derivative of the Hamiltonian is \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P_i}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\dot{Q}_i + \\sum_i P_i\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\dot{Q}_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\left( \\sum_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q_i}\\dot{Q}_i + \\sum_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot{Q}_i}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\dot{Q}_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nThis shows that if \\(L\\) does not explicitly depend on time, the Hamiltonian \\(H\\) is a constant of the motion. As will be shown later, \\(H\\) corresponds to the energy of the system, so if \\(\\partial L/\\partial t=0\\), the energy is a constant of the motion. Thus, energy is conjugate to time in analogy to canonical momentum being conjugate to position (note that energy \\(\\times\\) time also has the units of action). If the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on time, then the system can be thought of as being “symmetric” with respect to time, or “translationally” invariant with respect to time.\nThe Lagrangian for a charged particle in an electromagnetic field is \\[\nL = \\frac{mv^2}{2} + q\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x},t) - q\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nThe validity of Equation 4.5 will now be established by showing that it generates the Lorentz equation when inserted into Lagrange’s equation. Since no symmetry is assumed, there is no reason to use any special coordinate system and so ordinary Cartesian coordinates will be used as the canonical coordinates, in which case Equation 4.2 gives the canonical momentum as \\[\n\\mathbf{P} = m\\mathbf{v} + q\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x},t)\n\\]\nThe left-hand side of Equation 4.1 becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{P}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = m\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + q\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{A} \\right)\n\\] while the right-hand side of Equation 4.1 becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} &= q\\nabla(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}) - q\\nabla\\phi = q(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}) - q\\nabla\\phi \\\\\n&= q(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) - q\\nabla\\phi\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nEquating the above two expressions gives the Lorentz equation, where the electric field is defined as \\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\partial\\mathbf{A}/\\partial t - \\nabla\\phi\\) in accordance with Faraday’s law. This proves that Equation 4.5 is mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz equation when used with the principle of least action.\nThe Hamiltonian associated with this Lagrangian is, in Cartesian coordinates, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH &= \\mathbf{P}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} - L = \\frac{mv^2}{2} + q\\phi \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{P} - q\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\right)^2}{2m} + q\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4.6}\\] where the last line is the form more suitable for use with Hamilton’s equations, i.e., \\(H=H(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{P},t)\\). Equation 4.6 also shows that \\(H\\) is, as promised, the particle energy. If generalized coordinates are used, the energy can be written in a general form as \\(E=H(Q,P,t)\\). Equation 4.4 showed that even though both \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) depend on time, the energy depends on time only if \\(H\\) explicitly depends on time. Thus, in a situation where \\(H\\) does not explicitly depend on time, the energy would have the form \\(E=H(Q(t),P(t)) = \\mathrm{const}\\).\nIt is important to realize that both canonical momentum and energy depend on the reference frame. For example, a bullet fired in an airplane in the direction opposite to the airplane motion, and with a speed equal to the airplane’s speed, has a large energy as measured in the airplane frame, but zero energy as measured by an observer on the ground. A more subtle example (of importance to later analysis of waves and Landau damping) occurs when \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and/or \\(\\phi\\) has a wave-like dependence, e.g., \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\phi(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{ph}}t)\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{ph}}\\) is the wave phase velocity. This potential is time-dependent in the lab frame and so the associated Lagrangian has an explicit dependence on time in the lab frame, which implies that energy is not a constant of the motion in the lab frame. In contrast, \\(\\phi\\) is time-independent in the wave frame and so the energy is a constant of the motion in the wave frame. Existence of a constant of the motion reduces the complexity of the system of equations and typically makes it possible to integrate at least one equation in closed form. Thus, it is advantageous to analyze the system in the frame having the most constants of the motion.",

    "text": "5.2 Theory of Relativity\nIn Einstein’s theory of relativity, the path of an object moving relative to a particular frame of reference is defined by four coordinate functions \\(x_\\mu(\\tau)\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is a spacetime index which takes the value 0 for the timelike component, and 1, 2, 3 for the spacelike coordinates. The zeroth component is defined as the time coordinate multiplied by c, \\[\nx^0 = ct\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nEach function depends on one parameter τ called its proper time. As a column vector, \\[\n\\mathbf{x}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx^{0}(\\tau)\\\\\nx^{1}(\\tau)\\\\\nx^{2}(\\tau)\\\\\nx^{3}(\\tau)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nTime dilation\nFrom time dilation, the differentials in coordinate time \\(t\\) and proper time \\(\\tau\\) are related by \\[\n\\mathrm{d}t = \\gamma(u)\\mathrm{d}\\tau\n\\tag{5.3}\\] where the Lorentz factor, \\[\n\\gamma(u) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}\n\\tag{5.4}\\] is a function of the Euclidean norm \\(u\\) of the 3d velocity vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\): \\[\nu=\\left\\|\\ {\\mathbf{u}}\\ \\right\\|=\\sqrt{\\left(u^{1}\\right)^{2}+\\left(u^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(u^{3}\\right)^{2}}\n\\]\n\n5.2.1 Four-velocity\nA four-velocity is a four-vector in four-dimensional spacetime that represents the relativistic counterpart of velocity, which is a three-dimensional vector in space.\nPhysical events correspond to mathematical points in time and space, the set of all of them together forming a mathematical model of physical four-dimensional spacetime. The history of an object traces a curve in spacetime, called its world line. If the object has mass, so that its speed is necessarily less than the speed of light, the world line may be parametrized by the proper time of the object. The four-velocity is the rate of change of four-position with respect to the proper time along the curve. The velocity, in contrast, is the rate of change of the position in (three-dimensional) space of the object, as seen by an observer, with respect to the observer’s time.\nThe four-velocity is the tangent four-vector of a timelike world line. The four-velocity \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) at any point of world line \\(\\mathbf{X}(\\tau)\\) is defined as \\[\n\\mathbf{U} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{X}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\n\\tag{5.5}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the four-position and \\(\\tau\\) is the proper time.1\nThe relationship between the time \\(t\\) and the coordinate time \\(x^0\\) is defined by \\[\nx^0 = ct\n\\tag{5.6}\\]\nTaking the derivative of this with respect to the proper time \\(\\tau\\), we find the \\(U_\\mu\\) velocity component for \\(\\mu = 0\\): \\[\nU^{0}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{0}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}={\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(ct)}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}}=c\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}=c\\gamma(u)\n\\tag{5.7}\\] and for the other 3 components to proper time we get the \\(U_\\mu\\) velocity component for \\(\\mu = 1, 2, 3\\): \\[\nU^{i}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{i}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{i}}{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}} = \\frac {\\mathrm{d}x^{i}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\gamma(u) = \\gamma(u)u^{i}\n\\tag{5.8}\\] where we have used the chain rule from Equation 5.1 and Equation 5.3.\nThus, we find for the four-velocity \\(\\mathbf{U}\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{U}= \\gamma\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nc \\\\\n\\mathbf{u}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWritten in standard four-vector notation this is \\[\n\\mathbf{U}=\\gamma \\left(c,{\\mathbf{u}}\\right) = \\left(\\gamma c,\\gamma {\\mathbf{u}}\\right)\n\\tag{5.9}\\] where \\(\\gamma c\\) is the temporal component and \\(\\gamma \\mathbf{u}\\) is the spatial component. Unlike most other four-vectors, the four-velocity has only 3 independent components \\(u_{x},u_{y},u_{z}\\) instead of 4. The \\(\\gamma\\) factor is a function of the three-dimensional velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\).\nUsing the differential of the four-position in the rest frame, the magnitude of the four-velocity can be obtained by the Minkowski metric with signature (−, +, +, +): \\[\n\\left\\|\\mathbf{U} \\right\\|^{2}=\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}U^{\\mu}U^{\\nu}=\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X^{\\mu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X^{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}}=-c^{2}\n\\tag{5.10}\\] which is always a fixed constant.",

    "section": "6.2 Unit System Conversion",
    "text": "6.2 Unit System Conversion\nA rule of thumb is to check the number of constants in the system: making one constant equal to 1 requires to shrink the number of basic variables by 1. In ideal MHD Equation 8.49, there are 4 basic quantities (length, mass, time, and current density) and 1 physical constant \\(\\mu_0\\). If we include temperature, then there will be 5 basic quantities and 2 physical constants \\(\\mu_0\\), \\(R\\). This indicates that we need 3 reference quantities in order to make the 2 physical constants equal to 1 in the normalized units. For example, in the Earth’s magnetosphere, we select a reference length, e.g. \\(l_0=1\\,\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\), a reference mass density, e.g. \\(\\rho_0 = 1.67\\times10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\), and a reference magnetic field, e.g. \\(B_0 = 3.12\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{T}\\) (Earth’s magnetic field strength at the equator). All the rest conversion factors can be derived from these together with the physical constants \\(\\mu_0, R, m_i\\) expressed SI units. (\\(R\\) is needed for temperature and \\(m_i\\) is needed for number density.) Inserting the initially chosen values, we get a full set of conversion factors from variables in normalized units \\(n^\\prime, B^\\prime, u^\\prime, p^\\prime, T^\\prime, \\mathcal{E}^\\prime\\) to SI units \\(n, B, u, p, T, \\mathcal{E}\\): \\[\nU_\\mathrm{SI} = U^\\prime * U_0\n\\] where each conversion factor is summarized in Table 6.4. Note that in the definition of number density, the denominator is \\(m_i\\) instead of \\(m_0\\) and \\(R=2k_B/m_i\\) only appears in temperature. This is because mass does not appear in ideal MHD: for a given \\(\\rho\\), the same results are obtained for a heavy species with small number density and a light species with large number density, e.g. \\(\\rho=2m_i n_i = m_i 2n_i\\). In principle we can choose the reference mass arbitrarily, but here in order to make the values in SI units “look good” we choose \\(m_i\\). If you need to compare with a hybrid model, an easy way to make self-consistent conversion is to make mass \\(m_0=m_i\\) as a substitute for any of the basic variables. In this case, the dimensionless \\(\\rho=n\\). Also note that in Table 6.4 the MHD pressure and temperature are the sum of electron’s and ion’s pressure and temperature, which is the reason a factor of “2” pops out in the definition of temperature. If we are comparing to a hybrid model which assumes massless electrons, a proper modification would be \\(p_0=\\rho_0v_0^2/2\\) and \\(T_0=p_0*m_i/(k_B\\,\\rho_0)=m_i v_0^2 / k_B\\).\n\n\n\nTable 6.4: MHD unit conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample basic quantities in MHD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic variable\nNotation\nDefinition\nValue\n\n\n\n\nLength\n\\(l_0\\)\n\\(l_0=\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\)\n\\(6.371\\times10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}\\)\n\n\nMagnetic field\n\\(B_0\\)\n\\(B_0=B_\\mathrm{E}\\)\n\\(3.12\\times10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{T}\\)\n\n\nMass density\n\\(\\rho_0\\)\n\\(\\rho_0=\\rho_\\mathrm{E}\\)\n\\(1.67\\times10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample derived quantities in MHD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerived variable\nNotation\nDefinition\nValue\n\n\n\n\nMass\n\\(m_0\\)\n\\(m_0=\\rho_0 l_0^3\\)\n\\(4.32\\times10^3\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\)\n\n\nVelocity\n\\(v_0\\)\n\\(v_0=B_0/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\rho_0}\\)\n\\(6.81\\times10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\)\n\n\nTime\n\\(t_0\\)\n\\(t_0=l_0/v_0\\)\n\\(0.94\\,\\mathrm{s}\\)\n\n\nNumber density\n\\(n_0\\)\n\\(n_0=\\rho_0/m_i\\)\n\\(10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\)\n\n\nPressure\n\\(p_0\\)\n\\(p_0=\\rho_0v_0^2\\)\n\\(7.75\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\)\n\n\nTemperature\n\\(T_0\\)\n\\(T_0=m_i v_0^2 / (2k_B)\\)\n\\(2.81\\times10^9\\,\\mathrm{K}\\)\n\n\nEnergy density\n\\(\\mathcal{E}_0\\)\n\\(\\mathcal{E}_0=p_0\\)\n\\(7.75\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Example: \\(\\rho,\\rho\\mathbf{u},\\mathcal{E},\\mathbf{B}\\) to \\(n,u,T\\)\nWhen dealing with velocity distribution functions, one easy way is to write \\(f(\\mathbf{v})=f(\\mathbf{v}; n,\\mathbf{u},T)\\).

Then \\[\nv_y  = \\frac{m}{qB} \\dot{v}_x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\omega_c}\\dot{v}_x = \\pm i v_\\perp e^{i\\omega_c t} = \\dot{y}\n\\]\nIntegrating once again, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx - x_0 &= -i\\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_c}e^{i\\omega_c t} \\\\\ny - y_0 &= \\pm i\\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_c}e^{i\\omega_c t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe define the Larmor radius to be \\[\nr_L \\equiv \\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{mv_\\perp}{|q| B}\n\\tag{7.3}\\]\nNote that \\(2\\pi\\) does not appear in Equation 7.3!\nTaking the real part of the positions, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx - x_0 &= r_L\\sin\\omega_c t \\\\\ny - y_0 &= \\pm r_L \\cos\\omega_c t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis describes a circular orbit about a guiding center (\\(x_0, y_0\\)) which is fixed. The direction of the gyration is always such that the magnetic field generated by the charged particle is opposite to the externally imposed field. Plasma particles, therefore, tend to reduce the magnetic field, and plasmas are diamagnetic. In addition to this motion, there is an arbitrary velocity \\(v_z\\) along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) which is not affected by \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The trajectory of a charged particle in space is, in general, a helix. Looking along (against) the magnetic field, the particle rotating clockwise (anticlockwise) has a negative charge. In plasma physics this is the convention of right-handedness.\nThe unit of \\(\\omega_c\\) in SI units is rad/s. To convert it to hertz, we need to divide it by \\(2\\pi\\). The corresponding oscillation frequencies \\(f_{c\\alpha} = \\omega_{c\\alpha}/(2\\pi)\\) of electrons and protons are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{ce}[\\mathrm{Hz}] &= 28 B [\\mathrm{nT}] \\\\\nf_{cp}[\\mathrm{Hz}] &= 0.015 B [\\mathrm{nT}]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n7.1.2 Finite E\nIf now we allow an electric field to be present, the motion will be found to be the sum of two motions: the usual circular Larmor gyration plus a drift of the guiding center. The assumed spatial uniformity and time-independence of the fields represent the extreme limit of assuming that the fields are slowly changing in space and time. We may choose \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) to lie in the x-z plane so that \\(E_y = 0\\). As before, the z component of velocity is unrelated to the transverse components and can be treated separately. The equations of motion is now \\[\nm\\dot{\\mathbf{v}} = q( \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} )\n\\] whose z component is \\[\n\\dot{v_z} = \\frac{q}{m}E_z\n\\] or \\[\nv_z = \\frac{qE_z}{m}t + v_{z0}\n\\]\nThis is a straightforward acceleration along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The transverse components are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{v_x} &= \\frac{q}{m}E_x \\pm \\omega_c v_y \\\\\n\\dot{v_y} &= 0 \\mp \\omega_c v_x\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDifferentiating, we have (for constant \\(\\mathbf{E}\\)) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{v}_x &= -\\omega_c^2 v_x \\\\\n\\ddot{v}_y &= \\mp \\omega_c \\Big( \\frac{q}{m}E_x \\pm \\omega_c v_y \\Big) = -\\omega_c^2 \\Big( v_y + \\frac{E_x}{B} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can write this as \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\Big( v_y + \\frac{E_x}{B} \\Big) = -\\omega_c^2\\Big( v_y + \\frac{E_x}{B} \\Big)\n\\] so that it reduces to the previous case if we replace \\(v_y\\) by \\(v_y + (E_x/B)\\). The velocity solution is then replaced by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_x &= v_\\perp e^{i\\omega_c t} \\\\\nv_y &= \\pm v_\\perp e^{i\\omega_c t} - \\frac{E_x}{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe Larmor motion is the same as before, but there is superimposed a drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_{gc}\\) of the guiding center in the \\(-y\\) direction (for \\(E_x &gt; 0\\)).\nTo obtain a general formula for \\(\\mathbf{v}_{gc}\\), we can solve the momentum equation in vector form. We may omit the \\(m \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}/\\mathrm{d}t\\) term, since this term gives only the circular motion at \\(\\omega_c\\), which we already know about. Then the momentum equation becomes \\[\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} = 0\n\\]\nTaking the cross product with \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), we have \\[\n\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}\\times(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = \\mathbf{v}B^2 - \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\nThe transverse components with respect to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) of this equation are \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}/B^2 \\equiv \\mathbf{v}_E\n\\]\nWe define this to be \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\), the electric field drift of the guiding center. In magnitude, this drift is \\[\nv_E = \\frac{E(\\text{V/m})}{B(\\text{tesla})}\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{sec}}\n\\]\nIt is important to note that \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) is independent of q, m, and \\(v_\\perp\\). The reason is obvious from the following physical picture. In the first half-cycle of the ion’s orbit, it gains energy from the electric field and increases in \\(v_\\perp\\) and, hence, in \\(r_L\\). In the second half-cycle, it loses energy and decreases in \\(r_L\\). This difference in \\(r_L\\) on the left and right sides of the orbit causes the drift \\(v_E\\). A negative electron gyrates in the opposite direction but also gains energy in the opposite direction; it ends up drifting in the same direction as an ion. For particles of the same velocity but different mass, the lighter one will have smaller \\(r_L\\) and hence drift less per cycle. However, its gyration frequency is also larger, and the two effects exactly cancel. Two particles of the same mass but different energy would have the same \\(\\omega_c\\). The slower one will have smaller \\(r_L\\) and hence gain less energy from \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) in a half-cycle. However, for less energetic particles the fractional change in \\(r_L\\) for a given change in energy is larger, and these two effects cancel. Another way of interpreting this behavior is to recall that according to the theory of special relativity the electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}^\\prime\\) observed in a frame moving with velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is \\(\\mathbf{E}^\\prime = \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) and so \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) is simply a statement that a particle drifts in such a way to ensure that the electric field seen in its own frame vanishes.\nThe three-dimensional orbit in space for a charged particle with a nonzero initial velocity is therefore a slanted helix with changing pitch. The pitch angle is defined as \\[\n\\alpha = \\arctan{\\frac{v_\\perp}{v_\\parallel}} = \\arcsin{\\frac{v_\\perp}{v}} = \\arccos{\\frac{v_\\parallel}{v}}\n\\tag{7.4}\\]\n\n\n7.1.3 Gravitational Field\nThe foregoing result can be applied to other forces by replacing \\(q\\mathbf{E}\\) in the equation of motion by a general force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\). The guiding center drift caused by \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is then \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_f = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\]\nIn particular, if \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is the force of gravity \\(m\\mathbf{g}\\), there is a drift \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_g = \\frac{m}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{g}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\tag{7.5}\\]\nThis is similar to the drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) in that it is perpendicular to both the force and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), but it differs in one important respect. The drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_g\\) changes sign with the particle’s charge. Under a gravitational force, ions and electrons drift in opposite directions, so there is a net current density in the plasma given by \\[\n\\mathbf{j} = n(m_i+m_e)\\frac{\\mathbf{g}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\]\nThe physical reason for this drift is again the change in Larmor radius as the particle gains and loses energy in the gravitational field. Now the electrons gyrate in the opposite sense to the ions, but the force on them is in the same direction, so the drift is in the opposite direction. The magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{v}_g\\) is usually negligible, but when the lines of force (i.e. magnetic field lines) are curved, there is an effective gravitational force due to centrifugal force. This force, which is not negligible, is independent of mass; this is why we did not stress the m dependence of the drift here. Centrifugal force is the basis of a plasma instability called the “gravitational” instability, which has nothing to do with real gravity.\nAnd now it shall be clear that the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift analysis can be easily generalized to describe the effect on a charged particle of any force orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) by simply making the replacement \\(\\mathbf{E}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{F}/q\\) in the Lorentz equation. Thus, any spatially uniform, temporally constant force orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) will cause a drift \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_F = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{qB^2}\n\\] which leads to two counter-intuitive and important conclusions:\n\nA steady-state electric field perpendicular to a magnetic field does not drive currents in a plasma, but instead causes a bulk motion of the entire plasma across the magnetic field with the velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\).\nA steady-state force (e.g., gravity, centrifugal force, etc.) perpendicular to the magnetic field causes oppositely directed motions for electrons and ions and so drives a cross-field current \\[\n\\mathbf{j}_F = \\sum_\\sigma n_\\sigma \\frac{\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\]",

    "section": "7.2 Nonuniform B Field",
    "text": "7.2 Nonuniform B Field\nNow that the concept of a guiding center drift is firmly established, we can discuss the motion of particles in inhomogeneous fields — \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) fields which vary in space or time. For uniform fields we were able to obtain exact expressions for the guiding center drifts. As soon as we introduce inhomogeneity, the problem becomes too complicated to solve exactly. To get an approximate answer, it is customary to expand in the small ratio \\(r_L/L\\), where L is the scale length of the inhomogeneity. This type of theory, called orbit theory, can become extremely involved. We shall examine only the simplest cases, where only one inhomogeneity occurs at a time.\n\n7.2.1 ∇B ⊥ B: Grad-B Drift\nHere the magnetic field lines are straight, but their density increases, say, in the y direction. We can anticipate the result by using our simple physical picture. The gradient in |B| causes the Larmor radius to be larger at the bottom of the orbit than at the top, and this should lead to a drift, in opposite directions for ions and electrons, perpendicular to both B and \\(\\nabla B\\). The drift velocity should obviously be proportional to \\(r_L/L\\) and to \\(v_\\perp\\).\nConsider the Lorentz force \\(\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\), averaged over a gyration. Clearly, \\(\\bar{F}_x = 0\\), since the particle spends as much time moving up as down. We wish to calculate \\(\\bar{F}_y\\), in an approximate fashion, by using the undisturbed orbit of the particle to find the average. The undisturbed orbit is given by the solution in the first section for a uniform \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field. Taking the real part of the solution for \\(v_x\\) and \\(y\\), we have \\[\nF_y = -q v_x B_z(y) = -q v_\\perp(\\cos \\omega_c t) \\Big[ B_0 \\pm r_L(\\cos\\omega_c t )\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y} \\Big]\n\\] where we have made a Taylor expansion of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field about the point \\(x_0=0, y_0=0\\) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{B} &= \\mathbf{B}_0 + (\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} + ... \\\\\nBz &= B_0 + y(\\partial B_z/\\partial y) + ...\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis expansion of course requires \\(r_L / L \\ll 1\\), where L is the length scale of \\(\\partial Bz/\\partial y\\). The first term above averages to zero in a gyration, and the average of \\(\\cos^2 \\omega_c t\\) is \\(1/2\\), so that \\[\n\\bar{F}_y = \\mp q v_\\perp r_L \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y}\n\\]\nThe guiding center drift velocity is then \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{\\bar{F}_y}{|B|}\\widehat{x} = \\mp \\frac{v_\\perp r_L}{B}\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y} \\widehat{x}\n\\] where we have used the formula shown previously. Since the choice of the y axis was arbitrary, this can be generalized to \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}v_\\perp r_L \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\times \\nabla B}{B^2}\n\\]\nThis has all the dependences we expected from the physical picture; only the factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (arising from the averaging) was not predicted. Note that the \\(\\pm\\) stands for the sign of the charge, and lightface \\(B\\) stands for \\(|B|\\). The quantity \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}\\) is called the grad-B drift; it is in opposite directions for ions and electrons and causes a current transverse to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). An exact calculation of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}\\) would require using the exact orbit, including the drift, in the averaging process.\n\n\n7.2.2 Curved B: Curvature Drift\nHere we assume the magnetic field lines to be curved with a constant radius of curvature \\(R_c\\), and we take \\(|B|\\) to be constant. Such a field does not obey Maxwell’s equations in a vacuum, so in practice the grad-B drift will always be added to the effect derived here. A guiding center drift arises from the centrifugal force felt by the particles as they move along the field lines in their thermal motion. If \\(v_\\parallel^2\\) denotes the average square of the component of random velocity along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{R}_c\\) denotes the radius of curvature vector from the center to the curve, the average centrifugal force is \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{cf} = \\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{R_c}\\widehat{r} = mv_\\parallel^2\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}\n\\]\nAccording to the guiding center drift formula, this gives rise to a drift \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{R} = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{cf}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{qB^2}\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c \\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2}\n\\]\nThe drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_c\\) is called the curvature drift.\nWe must now compute the grad-B drift which accompanies this when the decrease of \\(|B|\\) with radius is taken into account. In a vacuum, we have \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = 0\\) (current-free). In the cylindrical coordinates, \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) only has a \\(z\\) component, since \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) has only a \\(\\theta\\) component and \\(\\nabla B\\) only an \\(r\\) component. We then have \\[\n(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})_z = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(rB_\\theta) = 0,\\, B\\propto \\frac{1}{r}\n\\]\nThus \\[\n|B| \\propto \\frac{1}{R_c},\\, \\frac{\\nabla B}{B} = - \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}\n\\tag{7.6}\\]\nUsing the expression of the grad-B drift, we have \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{v_\\perp r_L}{B^2}\\mathbf{B}\\times\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{v_\\perp^2}{\\omega_c}\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c\\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m}{q}v_\\perp^2\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c\\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}\n\\]\nAdding this to \\(\\mathbf{v}_c\\) , we have the total drift in a curved vacuum field \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_c + \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{m}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c\\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}\\left( v_\\parallel^2 + \\frac{1}{2}v_\\perp^2 \\right)\n\\]\nor with just the magnetic field \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_c + \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{m}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla B}{B^3}\\left( v_\\parallel^2 + \\frac{1}{2}v_\\perp^2 \\right)\n\\tag{7.7}\\]\nor if the kinetic energy \\(W\\) and pitch angle \\(\\theta\\) are involved \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_c + \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla B}{qB^3}\\Big( 2W\\cos^2\\theta + W\\sin^2\\theta \\Big) = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla B}{qB^3}\\left( 1 + W\\cos^2\\theta \\right)\n\\tag{7.8}\\]\nIt is unfortunate that these drifts add. This means that if one bends a magnetic field into a torus for the purpose of confining a thermonuclear plasma, the particles will drift out of the torus no matter how one juggles the temperatures and magnetic fields.\nFor a Maxwellian distribution, \\(\\bar{v_\\parallel^2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{v_\\perp^2}\\) are each equal to \\(k_B T/m\\), since \\(v_\\perp\\) involves two degrees of freedom. Then the average curved-field drift can be written as \\[\n\\bar{\\mathbf{v}}_{c+\\nabla B} = \\pm \\frac{v_{th}^2}{R_c\\omega_c}\\widehat{y} = \\pm\\frac{\\bar{r}_L}{R_c}v_{th}\\widehat{y}\n\\] where \\(\\widehat{y}\\) here is the direction of \\(\\widehat{R}_c\\times\\mathbf{B}\\). This shows that \\(\\bar{\\mathbf{v}}_{c+\\nabla B}\\) depends on the charge of the species but not on its mass.\nIf current exists and we cannot assume \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=0\\), we rely on the original definition of curvature radius \\[\n\\frac{\\hat{r}}{R_c} = \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = -\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{b}\n\\tag{7.9}\\]\nThen the curvature drift can be written as \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{R} = \\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{qB^2}\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c \\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2} = \\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{qB^4}\\mathbf{B}\\times\\left[ \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B} \\right]\n\\tag{7.10}\\]\nThe equivalence of Equation 7.7 and Equation 7.10 can be verified by using the equality1 \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{B}\\times(\\cancel{\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}}) &= (\\nabla\\mathbf{B})\\cdot\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} &= (\\nabla\\mathbf{B})\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = B\\nabla B\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n7.2.3 ∇B ∥ B: Magnetic Mirrors\nNow we consider a magnetic field which is pointed primarily in the z direction and whose magnitude varies in the z direction. Let the field be axisymmetric, with \\(B_\\theta = 0\\) and \\(\\partial/\\partial\\theta = 0\\). Since the magnetic field lines converge and diverge, there is necessarily a component \\(B_r\\). We wish to show that this gives rise to a force which can trap a particle in a magnetic field.\nWe can obtain \\(B_r\\) from \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = 0\\): \\[\n\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(rB_r) + \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = 0\n\\]\nIf \\(\\partial \\mathbf{B}_z/\\partial z\\) is given at \\(r=0\\) and does not vary much with r, we have approximately \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nrB_r &= -\\int_0^r r\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}dr \\simeq -\\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\Big[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}_z}{\\partial z} \\Big]_{r=0} \\\\\nB_r &= -\\frac{1}{2}r \\Big[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}_z}{\\partial z} \\Big]_{r=0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe variation of \\(|B|\\) with r causes a grad-B drift of guiding centers about the axis of symmetry, but there is no radial grad-B drift, because \\(\\partial B/\\partial \\theta = 0\\). The components of the Lorentz force are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_r &= q(\\underbrace{v_\\theta B_z}_{\\small{1}} - v_z \\cancel{B_\\theta}) \\\\\nF_\\theta &= q(\\underbrace{-v_r B_z}_{\\small{2}} + \\underbrace{v_z B_r}_{\\small{3}}) \\\\\nF_z &= q(v_r \\cancel{B}_\\theta - \\underbrace{v_\\theta B_r}_{\\small{4}})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTwo terms vanish if \\(B_\\theta = 0\\), and terms 1 and 2 give rise to the usual Larmor gyration. Term 3 vanishes on the axis; when it does not vanish, this azimuthal force causes a drift in the radial direction. This drift merely makes the guiding centers follow the magnetic field lines. Term 4 is the one we are interested in. Using the expression of \\(B_r\\), we have \\[\nF_z = \\frac{1}{2}q v_\\theta r_L \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\n\\]\nWe must now average over one gyration. For simplicity, consider a particle whose guiding center lies on the axis. Then \\(v_\\theta\\) is a constant during a gyration; depending on the sign of q, \\(v_\\theta\\) is \\(\\mp v_\\perp\\). Since \\(r = r_L\\) , the average force is \\[\n\\bar{F}_z = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}q v_\\perp r_L \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}q\\frac{v_\\perp^2}{\\omega_c} \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{mv_\\perp^2}{B} \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\n\\]\nWe define the magnetic moment of the gyrating particle to be \\[\n\\mu \\equiv \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2 / B\n\\] so that \\[\n\\bar{F}_z = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\n\\]\nThis is a specific example of the force on a diamagnetic particle, which in general can be written \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_\\parallel = -\\mu\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial \\mathbf{s}} = -\\mu\\nabla_\\parallel B\n\\] where \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}\\) is a line element along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Note that the definition of magnetic moment here is the same as the usual definition for the magnetic moment of a current loop with area A and current I: \\(\\mu = IA\\). In the case of a singly charged ion, I is generated by a charge e coming around \\(\\omega_c / 2\\pi\\) times a second: \\(I = e\\omega_c/2\\pi\\). The area A is \\(\\pi r_L^2 = \\pi r_L^2/\\omega_c^2\\). Thus \\[\n\\mu = \\frac{e\\omega_c}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\pi r_L^2}{\\omega_c^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{v_\\perp^2 e}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{mv_\\perp^2}{B}\n\\]\nAs the particle moves into regions of stronger or weaker B, its Larmor radius changes, but μ remains invariant. To prove this, consider the component of the equation of motion along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\): \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_\\parallel}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial s}\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(v_\\parallel\\) on the left and its equivalent \\(ds/\\mathrm{d}t\\) on the right, we have \\[\nmv_\\parallel \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_\\parallel}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big( \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 \\Big) = -\\mu\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial s}\\frac{ds}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\mu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\]\nHere \\(\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is the variation of \\(B\\) as seen by the particle; \\(B\\) itself is constant. The particle’s energy must be conserved, so we have \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big( \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2 \\Big) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big( \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\mu B \\Big) = 0\n\\]\nWith the previous equation this becomes \\[\n-\\mu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\mu B) = 0\n\\] so that \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\n\\]\nThe invariance of \\(\\mu\\) is the basis for one of the primary schemes for plasma confinement: the magnetic mirror. As a particle moves from a weak-field region to a strong-field region in the course of its thermal motion, it sees an increasing B, and therefore its \\(v_\\perp\\) must increase in order to keep μ constant. Since its total energy must remain constant, \\(v_\\parallel\\) must necessarily decrease. If B is high enough in the “throat” of the mirror, \\(v_\\parallel\\) eventually becomes zero; and the particle is “reflected” back to the weak-field region. It is, of course, the force \\(\\mathbf{F}_\\parallel\\) which causes the reflection. The nonuniform field of a simple pair of coil form two magnetic mirrors between which a plasma can be trapped. This effect works on both ions and electrons.\nThe trapping is not perfect, however. For instance, a particle with \\(v_\\perp = 0\\) will have no magnetic moment and will not feel any force along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). A particle with small \\(v_\\perp / v_\\parallel\\) at the midplane (\\(B = B_0\\)) will also escape if the maximum field \\(B_m\\) is not large enough. For given \\(B_0\\) and \\(B_m\\), which particles will escape? A particle with \\(v_\\perp = v_{\\perp 0}\\) and \\(v_\\parallel = v_{\\parallel 0}\\) at the midplane will have \\(v_\\perp = v_\\perp^\\prime\\) and \\(v_\\parallel = 0\\) at its turning point. Let the field be \\(B^\\prime\\) there. Then the invariants of \\(\\mu\\) yields \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{mv_{\\perp 0}^2}{B_0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m{v_{\\perp 0}^{\\prime}}^2}{B^\\prime}\n\\]\nConservation of energy requires \\[\n{v_{\\perp 0}^{\\prime}}^2 = v_{\\perp 0}^2 + v_{\\parallel 0}^2 \\equiv v_0^2\n\\]\nCombining the above two equations, we find \\[\n\\frac{B_0}{B^\\prime} = \\frac{v_{\\perp 0}^2}{{v_{\\perp}^{\\prime}}^2} \\equiv \\sin^2 \\theta\n\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the pitch angle of the orbit in the weak-field region. Particles with smaller θ will mirror in regions of higher B. If θ is too small, \\(B^\\prime\\) exceeds \\(B_m\\); and the particles does not mirror at all. Replacing \\(B^\\prime\\) by \\(B_m\\), we see that the smallest \\(\\theta\\) of a confined particle is given by \\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta_m = \\frac{B_0}{B_m} \\equiv \\frac{1}{R_m}\n\\] where \\(R_m\\) is the mirror ratio. It defines the boundary of a region in velocity space in the shape of a cone, called a loss cone. Particles lying within the loss cone are not confined. Consequently, a mirror-confined plasma is never isotropic. Note that the loss cone is independent of q or m. Without collisions, both ions and electrons are equally well confined. When collisions occur, particles are lost when they change their pitch angle in a collision and are scattered into the loss cone. Generally, electrons are lost more easily because they have a higher collision frequency.\nThe magnetic mirror was first proposed by Enrico Fermi as a mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic rays. Protons bouncing between magnetic mirrors approaching each other at high velocity could gain energy at each bounce. How such mirrors could arise is another story. A further example of the mirror effect is the confinement of particles in the Van Allen belts. The magnetic field of the earth, being strong at the poles and weak at the equator, forms a natural mirror with rather large \\(R_m\\).",

    "text": "7.3 Nonuniform E Field\nNow we let the magnetic field be uniform and the electric field be nonuniform. For simplicity, we assume \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) to be in the x direction and to vary sinusoidally in the x direction: \\[\n\\mathbf{E} \\equiv E_0 (\\cos kx)\\widehat{x}\n\\]\nThis field distribution has a wavelength \\(\\lambda = 2\\pi / k\\), and is the result of a sinusoidal distribution of charges, which we need not specify. In practice, such a charge distribution can arise in a plasma during a wave motion. The equation of motion is \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q[\\mathbf{E}(x) + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}]\n\\] whose transverse components are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{v}_x &= \\frac{qB}{m}v_y + \\frac{q}{m}E_x(x) \\\\\n\\dot{v}_y &= -\\frac{qB}{m}v_x\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{v}_x &= -\\omega_c^2 v_x \\pm \\omega_c \\frac{\\dot{E}_x}{B} \\\\\n\\ddot{v}_y &= -\\omega_c^2 v_y -\\omega_c^2\\frac{E_x(x)}{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere \\(E_x(x)\\) is the electric field at the position of the particle. To evaluate this, we need to know the particle’s orbit, which we are trying to solve for in the first place. If the electric field is weak, we may, as an approximation, use the undisturbed orbit to evaluate \\(E_x(x)\\). The orbit in the absence of the E field was given before \\[\nx = x_0 + r_L\\sin \\omega_c t\n\\] so we have \\[\n\\ddot{v}_y = -\\omega_c^2 v_y -\\omega_c^2\\frac{E_0}{B}\\cos k (x_0 + r_L \\sin\\omega_c t)\n\\]\nAnticipating the result, we look for a solution which is the sum of a gyration at \\(\\omega_c\\) and a steady drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\). Since we are interested in finding an expression for \\(v_E\\), we take out the gyratory motion by averaging over a cycle. The \\(v_x\\) component then gives \\(\\bar{v}_x = 0\\).2 In the \\(v_y\\) component, the oscillating term \\(\\ddot{v}_y\\) clearly averages to zero, and we have\n\\[\n\\bar{\\ddot{v}_y} = 0 = -\\omega_c^2 \\bar{v}_y -\\omega_c^2\\frac{E_0}{B}\\bar{\\cos k (x_0 + r_L \\sin\\omega_c t)}\n\\]\nExpanding the cosine, we have \\[\n\\cos k (x_0 + r_L \\sin\\omega_c t) = \\cos(kx_0) \\cos(kr_L \\sin\\omega_c t) - \\sin(kx_0) \\sin(kr_L \\sin\\omega_c t)\n\\]\nIt will suffice to treat the small Larmor radius case, \\(kr_L \\ll 1\\). The Taylor expansions allow us to write \\[\n\\cos k (x_0 + r_L \\sin\\omega_c t) \\approx \\cos(kx_0)\\big( 1 - \\frac{1}{2}k^2r_L^2 \\sin^2\\omega_c t \\big) - \\sin(kx_0)k r_L \\sin\\omega_c t\n\\]\nThe last term vanishes upon averaging over time, and it gives \\[\n\\bar{v}_y = -\\frac{E_0}{B}\\cos(kx_0)\\big( 1 - \\frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \\big) = -\\frac{E_x(x_0)}{B}\\big( 1 - \\frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \\big)\n\\]\nThus the usual \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift is modified by the inhomogeneity to read \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_E = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\\big( 1 - \\frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \\big)\n\\]\nThe physical reason for this is easy to see. An ion with its guiding center at a maximum of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) actually spends a good deal of its time in regions of weaker \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). Its average drift, therefore, is less than E/B evaluated at the guiding center. In a linearly varying \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field, the ion would be in a stronger field on one side of the orbit and in a field weaker by the same amount on the other side; the correction to \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) then cancels out. From this it is clear that the correction term depends on the second derivative of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). For the sinusoidal distribution we assumed, the second derivative is always negative with respect to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). For an arbitrary variation of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), we need only replace \\(ik\\) by \\(\\nabla\\) and write the drift as \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_E = \\Big( 1 + \\frac{1}{4}r_L^2\\nabla^2 \\Big) \\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\tag{7.11}\\]\nThe second term is called the finite-Larmor-radius effect. What is the significance of this correction? Since \\(r_L\\) is much larger for ions than for electrons, \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) is no longer independent of species. If a density clump occurs in a plasma, an electric field can cause the ions and electrons to separate, generating another electric field. If there is a feedback mechanism that causes the second electric field to enhance the first one, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) grows indefinitely, and the plasma is unstable. Such an instability, called a drift instability, is one type of plasma instabilities. The grad-B drift, of course, is also a finite-Larmor-radius effect and also causes charges to separate. However, \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} \\propto kr_L\\) whereas the correction term above is proportional to \\(k^2 r_L^2\\). The nonuniform-E-field effect, therefore, is important at relatively large k, or small scale lengths of the inhomogeneity. For this reason, drift instabilities belong to a more general class called microinstabilities.",

    "text": "7.4 Time-Varying E Field\nLet us now take \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) to be uniform in space but varying in time. First, consider the case in which \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) alone varies sinusoidally in time, and let it lie along the x axis: \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = E_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\widehat{x}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\dot{E}_x = i\\omega E_x\\), we can write the velocity x-component equation as \\[\n\\ddot{v}_x = -\\omega_c^2 \\Big( v_x \\mp \\frac{i\\omega}{\\omega_c}\\frac{\\tilde{E}_x}{B} \\Big)\n\\]\nLet us define \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{v}_p &\\equiv \\pm \\frac{i\\omega}{\\omega_c}\\frac{\\tilde{E}_x}{B} \\\\\n\\tilde{v}_E &\\equiv \\frac{\\tilde{E}_x}{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the tilde has been added merely to emphasize that the drift is oscillating. The plus (minus) sign, as usual, denotes positive (negative) \\(q\\). Now the x and y velocity component equations can be written as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{v}_x &= -\\omega_c^2(v_x - \\tilde{v}_p) \\\\\n\\ddot{v}_y &= -\\omega_c^2(v_y - \\tilde{v}_E)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBy analogy with the derivation in the case of a uniform EM field, we try a solution which is the sum of a drift and a gyratory motion: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_x &= v_\\perp e^{i\\omega_c t} + \\tilde{v}_p \\\\\nv_y &= \\pm i v_\\perp e^{i\\omega_c t} + \\tilde{v}_E\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we now differentiate twice with respect to time, we find \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{v}_x &= -\\omega_c^2 v_x + (\\omega_c^2 - \\omega^2)\\tilde{v}_p \\\\\n\\ddot{v}_y &= -\\omega_c^2 v_y + (\\omega_c^2 - \\omega^2)\\tilde{v}_E\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is not the same as the previous expressions right above unless \\(\\omega^2 \\ll \\omega_c^2\\). If we now make the assumption that \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) varies slowly, so that \\(\\omega^2 \\ll \\omega_c^2\\), then there we have the approximate solution.\nThe solution of velocities in x and y tells us that the guiding center motion has two components. The y component, perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), is the usual \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift, except that \\(v_E\\) now oscillates slowly at the frequency \\(\\omega\\). The x component, a new drift along the direction of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), is called the polarization drift. By replacing \\(i\\omega\\) with \\(\\partial/\\partial t\\), we can generalize the expression of \\(v_p\\) and define the polarization drift as \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_p = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\omega_c B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) is in opposite directions for ions and electrons, there is a polarization current; for Z = 1, this is \\[\n\\mathbf{j}_p = ne(v_{ip} - v_{ep}) = \\frac{ne}{eB^2}(M+m)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\rho}{B^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{7.12}\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the mass density.\nThe physical reason for the polarization current is simple. Consider an ion at rest in a magnetic field. If a field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is suddenly applied, the first thing the ion does is to move in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). Only after picking up a velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) does the ion feel a Lorentz force \\(e\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) and begin to move perpendicular to both fields. If \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is now kept constant, there is no further \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) drift but only a \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) drift. However, if \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is reversed, there is again a momentary drift, this time to the left. Thus \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) is a startup drift due to inertia and occurs only in the first half-cycle of each gyration during which \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) changes. Consequently, \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) goes to zero when \\(\\omega/\\omega_c \\ll 1\\).\nThe polarization effect in a plasma is similar to that in a solid dielectric, where \\(\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P}\\). The dipoles in a plasma are ions and electrons separated by a distance \\(r_L\\). But since ions and electrons can move around to preserve quasineutrality, the application of a steady \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field does not result in a polarization field \\(\\mathbf{P}\\). However, if \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) oscillates, an oscillating current \\(\\mathbf{j}_p\\) results from the lag due to the ion inertia.\nIt is obvious that in this case the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift speed depends on time and the guiding center coordinate system is non-inertial. The polarization drift arises from the fictuous (inertial) force \\(-m \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_E/\\mathrm{d}t\\). It means that the guiding center locations will not change due to the polarization drift!\nLet us demonstrate this in a single configuration. Assume \\(\\mathbf{B}=B\\hat{z}\\), \\(\\mathbf{E}=Et\\hat{y}\\). Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle in the perpendicular plane: \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_\\perp = v_\\perp\\hat{e}_\\perp = v_\\perp(\\cos\\theta\\hat{x}+\\sin\\theta\\hat{y})\n\\]\nThe guiding center is defined as \\[\n\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{r}_L = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}_\\perp / \\omega_c = \\mathbf{x} - \\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_c}\\hat{\\theta}\n\\] where \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathbf{b}\\times\\hat{e}_\\perp\\). The equation of motion \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= q(\\mathbf{E} +\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\mathbf{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] in the guiding center coordinates the two selected scalar equations can be written as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= qE_x + qv_yB \\\\\n\\frac{dX_y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= v_y - \\frac{1}{\\omega_c}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_x}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] such that \\[\n\\frac{dX_y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\n\\]",

We can no longer assume the fields to be completely uniform.

Thus \\[\n\\delta \\Big( \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2  \\Big) = \\mu \\delta B\n\\]\nSince the left-hand-side is \\(\\delta(\\mu B)\\), we have the desired result \\[\n\\delta \\mu = 0\n\\]\nThe magnetic moment is invariant in slowly varying magnetic fields.\nAs the B field varies in strength, the Larmor orbits expand and contract, and the particles lose and gain transverse energy. This exchange of energy between the particles and the field is described very simply by the invariant of magnetic moment. The invariance of \\(\\mu\\) allows us to prove easily the following well-known theorem: The magnetic flux through a Larmor orbit is constant.\nThe flux \\(\\Phi\\) is given by \\(BS\\), with \\(S = \\pi r_L^2\\).

A plasma is injected into a sequence of magnetic mirrors and by keep increasing the magnetic field in subsequent mirrors we can increase the plasma velocities.",

    "text": "7.6 Drifts in slowly changing arbitrary fields\nMost of the drift motion we have considered before can be described under one framework. Consider in arbitrarily complicated but slowly changing fields subject to the following restrictions:\n\nThe time variation is so slow that the fields can be considered as approximately constant during each cyclotron period of the motion.\nThe fields vary so gradually in space that they are nearly uniform over the spatial extent of any single complete cyclotron drift.\nThe electric and magnetic fields are related by Faraday’s law \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}=-\\dot{\\mathbf{B}}\\).\n\\(E/B\\ll c\\) so that relativistic effects are unimportant (otherwise there would be a problem with \\(v_E\\) becoming faster than \\(c\\).)\n\nThese are known as the guiding center approximation. The center of the gyro motion is the guiding center (GC) and we call the frame of reference where \\(v_\\parallel = 0\\) is the guiding center system (GCS). In this more general situation a charged particle will gyrate about \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), stream parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), have \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drifts across \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), and may also have force-based drifts. The analysis is based on the assumption that all these various motions are well-separated; this assumption is closely related to the requirement that the fields vary slowly and also to the concept of adiabatic invariant.\nThe assumed separation of scales is expressed by decomposing the particle motion into a fast, oscillatory component — the gyro-motion — and a slow component obtained by averaging out the gyromotion. As sketched in Figure 7.1, the particle’s position and velocity are each decomposed into two terms \\[\n\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t) + \\mathbf{r}_L(t),\\quad \\mathbf{v}(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t) + \\mathbf{v}_L(t)\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{r}_L(t), \\mathbf{v}_L(t)\\) give the fast gyration of the particle in a cyclotron orbit and \\(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t), \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)\\) are the slowly changing motion of the guiding center obtained after averaging out the cyclotron motion. Ignoring any time dependence of the fields for now, the magnetic field seen by the particle can be written as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}(t)) &= \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)+\\mathbf{r}_L(t)) \\\\\n&= \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + (\\mathbf{r}_L(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBecause \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) was assumed to be nearly uniform over the cyclotron orbit, it is sufficient to keep only the first term in the Taylor expansion of the magnetic field. The electric field may be expanded in a similar fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Drift in an arbitrarily complicated field.\n\n\n\nAfter insertion of these Taylor expansions for the non-uniform electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz equation becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left[ \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t) + \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t) \\right]}{\\mathrm{d}t} =& q\\left[ \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + (\\mathbf{r}_L(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E} \\right] \\\\\n& + q[ \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t) + \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t) ] \\times \\left[ \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + (\\mathbf{r}_L(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe gyromotion (i.e. the fast cyclotron motion) is defined to be the solution of the equation \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t))\n\\]\nSubstracting this fast motion equation from the prior one leaves \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} =& q\\left[ \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + (\\mathbf{r}_L(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E} \\right] \\\\\n& + q \\left\\{ \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)\\times\\left[ \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + (\\mathbf{r}_L(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right] + \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.13}\\]\nLet us now average Equation 7.13 over one gyroperiod in which case terms linear in gyromotion average to zero. What remains is an equation describing the slow quantities, namely \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q\\left\\{ \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)\\times\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + \\left&lt; \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt; \\right\\}\n\\tag{7.14}\\] where \\(&lt;&gt;\\) means averaged over a cyclotron period. The guiding center velocity can now be decomposed into components perpendicular and parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t) = \\mathbf{v}_{\\perp gc}(t) + v_{\\parallel gc}(t)\\hat{b}\n\\] so that \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left(\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}(t)\\hat{b}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\hat{b} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}(t)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{b}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\]\nDenoting the distance along the magnetic field by \\(s\\), the derivative of the magnetic field unit vector can be written, to lowest order, as (???) \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{b}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial\\hat{b}}{\\partial s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}t} = v_{\\parallel gc}\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{b}\n\\] so Equation 7.14 becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\hat{b} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}^2(t)\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{b} \\right] =& q\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) \\\\\n& + q\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)\\times\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) \\\\\n& + q\\left&lt; \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe component of this equation along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is \\[\nm \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q\\left[ E_\\parallel(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + \\left&lt; \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;_\\parallel \\right]\n\\] while the component perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp\\mathrm{gc}}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}^2(t)\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{b} \\right] =& q\\mathbf{E}_\\perp(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) \\\\\n& + q\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)\\times\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) \\\\\n& + q\\left&lt; \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;_\\perp\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.15}\\]\nEquation 7.15 is of the generic form \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp gc}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{F}_\\perp + q\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{7.16}\\] where \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_\\perp = q\\left[ \\mathbf{E}_\\perp(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{gc}(t)) + \\left&lt; \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{L}(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;_\\perp \\right] - m\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel\\mathrm{gc}}^2(t)\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{b}\n\\tag{7.17}\\]\nEquation 7.16 is solved iteratively based on the assumption that \\(\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{gc}\\) has a slow time dependence. In the first iteration, the time dependence is neglected altogether so that the left-hand side of Equation 7.16 is set to zero to obtain the “first guess” for the perpendicular drift to be \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp gc}\\simeq \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{F} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_\\perp\\times\\mathbf{B}}{qB^2}\n\\]\nNext, \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) is defined to be a correction to this first guess, where \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) is assumed small and incorporates effects due to any time dependence of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp gc}\\). To determine \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\), we write \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp gc} = \\mathbf{v}_F +\\mathbf{v}_p\\) so, to second order Equation 7.16 becomes \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{F}+\\mathbf{v}_p)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{F}_\\perp + q(\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{F} + \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{p})\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{7.18}\\]\nIn accordance with the slowness condition, it is assumed that \\(|\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_p/\\mathrm{d}t| \\ll |\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{d}t|\\) so Equation 7.18 becomes \\[\n0 = -m\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_F}{\\mathrm{d}t} + q\\mathbf{v}_p \\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\nCrossing this equation with \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) gives the general polarization drift \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_p = -\\frac{m}{qB^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_F}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\nThe most important example of the polarization drift is when \\(\\mathbf{v}_F\\) is the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift in a uniform, constant magnetic field so that (\\(\\mathbf{E}\\perp\\mathbf{B}\\)?) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{v}_p &= -\\frac{m}{qB^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} \\right)\\times\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n&= \\frac{m}{qB^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo calculate the middle term on the RHS of Equation 7.18, it is necessary to average over cyclotron orbits. This middle term is defined as the “grad B” force \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} = q\\left&lt; \\mathbf{v}_L(t)\\times(\\mathbf{r}_L(t)\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;\n\\tag{7.19}\\]\nTo simplify the algebra for the averaging, a local Cartesian coordinate system is used with \\(x\\) axis in the direction of the gyrovelocity at \\(t=0\\) and \\(z\\) axis in the direction of the magnetic field at the gyrocenter. Thus, the Larmor orbit velocity has the form \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_L(t) = v_{L0}\\left[ \\hat{x}\\cos\\omega_c t -\\hat{y}\\sin\\omega_c t \\right]\n\\] where \\[\n\\omega_c = \\frac{qB}{m}\n\\] is the cyclotron frequency we know before and the Larmor orbit position has the form \\[\n\\mathbf{r}_L(t) = \\frac{v_{L0}}{\\omega_c}\\left[ \\hat{x}\\sin\\omega_c t +\\hat{y}\\cos\\omega_c t \\right]\n\\]\nInserting the above two expressions in Equation 7.19 gives \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} = q\\frac{v_{L0}^2}{\\omega_c} \\left&lt;\\left[ \\hat{x}\\cos\\omega_c t -\\hat{y}\\sin\\omega_c t \\right]\\times(\\left[ \\hat{x}\\sin\\omega_c t +\\hat{y}\\cos\\omega_c t \\right]\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;\n\\]\nNoting that \\(\\left&lt; \\sin^2\\omega_c t \\right&gt; = \\left&lt; \\cos^2\\omega_c t \\right&gt; = 1/2\\) while \\(\\left&lt; \\sin\\omega_c\\cos\\omega_c \\right&gt; = 0\\), this reduces to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} &= \\frac{qv_{L0}^2}{2\\omega_c}\\left[ \\hat{x}\\times\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial y} - \\hat{y}\\times\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial x} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{mv_{L0}^2}{2B}\\left[ \\hat{x}\\times\\frac{\\partial(B_y\\hat{y}+B_z\\hat{z})}{\\partial y} - \\hat{y}\\times\\frac{\\partial(B_x\\hat{x}+B_z\\hat{z})}{\\partial x} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{mv_{L0}^2}{2B}\\left[ \\hat{z}\\left( \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial x} \\right) -\\hat{y}\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y} - \\hat{x}\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBut from \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0\\), it is seen that \\(\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\\) so the “grad B” force is \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} = -\\frac{mv_{L0}^2}{2B}\\nabla B\n\\] where the approximation \\(B_z\\simeq B\\) has been used since the magnetic field direction is mainly in the \\(\\hat{z}\\) direction.\nBy applying the guiding center approximation, we reduce the number of independent variables from 6 \\((x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z)\\) to 5 \\((x,y,z,v_\\perp, v_\\parallel)\\).",

    "section": "7.8 Adiabatic Invariants",
    "text": "7.8 Adiabatic Invariants\nIt is well known in classical mechanics that whenever a system has a periodic motion, the action integral \\(\\oint p dq\\) taken over a period is a constant of the motion. Here \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the generalized momentum and coordinate which repeat themselves in the motion. If a slow change is made in the system, so that the motion is not quite periodic, the constant of the motion does not change and is then called an adiabatic invariant. By slow here we mean slow compared with the period of motion, so that the integral \\(\\oint p dq\\) is well defined even though it is strictly no longer an integral over a closed path. Adiabatic invariants play an important role in plasma physics; they allow us to obtain simple answers in many instances involving complicated motions. There are three adiabatic invariants, each corresponding to a different type of periodic motion.\nA review of adiabatic charged-particle motion is given by Northrop (1963).\n\n7.8.1 Adiabatic Invariant of a Pendulum\nPerfect symmetry is never attained in reality. This leads to the practical question of how constants of the motion behave when space and/or time symmetries are “good”, but not perfect. Does the utility of constants of the motion collapse abruptly when the slightest non-symmetrical blemish rears its ugly head, does the utility decay gracefully, or does something completely different happen? To answer these questions, we begin by considering the problem of a small-amplitude pendulum having a time-dependent, but slowly changing resonant frequency \\(\\omega(t)\\). Since \\(\\omega^2=g/l\\), the time-dependence of the frequency might result from either a slow change in the gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) or else from a slow change in the pendulum length \\(l\\). In both cases the pendulum equation of motion will be \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\omega^2(t)x = 0\n\\tag{7.28}\\]\nThis equation cannot be solved exactly for arbitrary \\(\\omega(t)\\) but if a modest restriction is put on \\(\\omega(t)\\) the equation can be solved approximately using the WKB method (Wentzel 1926, Kramers 1926, Brillouin 1926). This method is based on the hypothesis that the solution for a time-dependent frequency is likely to be a generalization of the constant-frequency solution \\[\nx = \\mathrm{Re}\\left[ A\\exp(i\\omega t) \\right]\n\\] where this generalization is postulated to be of the form \\[\nx = \\mathrm{Re}\\left[ A(t) e^{i\\int^t \\omega(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime} \\right]\n\\tag{7.29}\\] Here \\(A(t)\\) is an amplitude function determined as follows: calculate the first derivative we get \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathrm{Re}\\left[ i\\omega A e^{i\\int^t \\omega(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}t} e^{i\\int^t \\omega(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime} \\right]\n\\] then the second derivative \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = \\mathrm{Re}\\left[ \\left( i\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{\\mathrm{d}t}A + 2i\\omega\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}t} -\\omega^2 A + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\right) e^{i\\int^t \\omega(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime} \\right]\n\\] and insert this last result into Equation 7.28 which reduces to \\[\ni\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{\\mathrm{d}t}A + 2i\\omega\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = 0\n\\tag{7.30}\\] since the terms involving \\(\\omega^2\\) cancel exactly. To proceed further, we make an assumption — the validity of which is to be checked later — that the time dependence of \\(\\mathrm{d}A/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is sufficiently slow to allow dropping the last term in Equation 7.30 relative to the middle term. The two terms that remain in Equation 7.30 can then be rearranged as \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{2}{A}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\] which has the exact solution \\[\nA(t) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\omega(t)}}\n\\tag{7.31}\\]\nThe assumption of slowness is thus at least self-consistent, for if \\(t\\) is indeed slowly changing, Equation 7.31 shows that At will also be slowly changing and the dropping of the last term in Equation 7.30 is justified. The slowness requirement can be quantified by assuming that the frequency has an exponential dependence \\[\n\\omega(t) = \\omega_0 e^{\\alpha t}\n\\]\nThus, \\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\] is a measure of how fast the frequency is changing compared to the frequency itself. Hence, dropping the last term in Equation 7.30 is legitimate if \\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\ll 4\\omega_0\n\\tag{7.32}\\]\nIn other words, if Equation 7.32 is satisfied, then the fractional change of the pendulum period per period is small.\nEquation 7.31 indicates that when \\(\\omega\\) is time-dependent, the pendulum amplitude is not constant and so the pendulum energy is not conserved. It turns out that what is conserved is the action integral \\[\nS = \\oint v\\mathrm{d}x\n\\tag{7.33}\\] where the integration is over one period of oscillation. This integral can also be written in terms of time as \\[\nS = \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau} v\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathrm{d}t\n\\] where \\(t_0\\) is a time when \\(x\\) is at an instantaneous maximum and \\(\\tau\\), the period of a complete cycle, is defined as the interval between two successive times when \\(\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}t = 0\\) and \\(\\mathrm{d}^2/\\mathrm{d}t^2\\) has the same sign (e.g., for a pendulum, \\(t_0\\) would be a time when the pendulum has swung all the way to the right and so is reversing its velocity while \\(\\tau\\) is the time one has to wait for this to happen again). To show that action is conserved, Equation 7.33 can be integrated by parts as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS &= \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( x\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right) - x\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\right]\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= \\left[ x\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right]_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau} - \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau}x\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau} \\omega^2 x^2 \\mathrm{d}t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.34}\\] where the integrated term has vanished by virtue of the definitions of \\(t_0\\) and \\(\\tau\\), and Equation 7.28 has been used to substitute \\(\\mathrm{d}^2 x/\\mathrm{d}t^2\\). Equation 7.29 and Equation 7.31 can be combined to give \\[\nx(t) = x(t_0)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega(t_0)}{\\omega(t)}}\\cos\\left( \\int_{t_0}^{t}\\omega(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime \\right)\n\\] so Equation 7.34 becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS &= \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau}\\omega(t^\\prime)^2 \\left[ x(t_0)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega(t_0)}{\\omega(t^\\prime)}}\\cos\\left( \\int_{t_0}^{t^\\prime}\\omega(t^{\\prime\\prime})\\mathrm{d}t^{\\prime\\prime} \\right) \\right]\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime \\\\\n&= [x(t_0)]^2 \\omega(t_0)\\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\\tau}\\omega(t^\\prime)\\cos^2\\left( \\int_{t_0}^{t^\\prime}\\omega(t^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime) \\right)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime \\\\\n&= [x(t_0)]^2 \\omega(t_0)\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\cos^2\\xi = \\pi [x(t_0)]^2 \\omega(t_0) = \\mathrm{const.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.35}\\] where \\(\\xi=\\int_{t_0}^{t^\\prime}\\omega(t^{\\prime\\prime})\\mathrm{d}t^{\\prime\\prime}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{d}\\xi=\\omega(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime\\). Equation 7.33 shows that \\(S\\) is the area in phase-space enclosed by the trajectory \\([x(t),v(t)]\\) and Equation 7.35 shows that for a slowly changing pendulum frequency, this area is a constant of the motion. Since the average energy of the pendulum scales as \\(\\sim[\\omega(t)x(t)]^2\\), we see from Equation 7.31 that the ratio \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{energy}}{\\mathrm{frequency}}\\sim \\omega(t)x^2(t)\\sim S\\sim\\mathrm{const}.\n\\tag{7.36}\\]\nThe ratio in Equation 7.36 is the classical equivalent of the quantum number \\(N\\) of a simple harmonic oscillator because in quantum mechanics the energy \\(E\\) of a simple harmonic oscillator is related to the frequency by the relation \\(E/\\hbar \\omega = N+1/2\\).\nThis analysis clearly applies to any dynamical system having an equation of motion of the form of Equation 7.28. Hence, if the dynamics of plasma particles happens to be of this form, then \\(S\\) can be added to our repertoire of constants of the motion.\n\n\n7.8.2 Extension of WKB method to general adiabatic invariant\nAction has the dimensions of (canonical momentum) × (canonical coordinate) so we may anticipate that for general Hamiltonian systems, the action integral given in Equation 7.33 is not an invariant because \\(v\\) is not, in general, proportional to \\(P\\). We postulate that the general form for the action integral is \\[\nS = \\oint P\\mathrm{d}Q\n\\tag{7.37}\\] where the integral is over one period of the periodic motion and \\(P, Q\\) are the relevant canonical momentum-coordinate conjugate pair. The proof of adiabatic invariance used for Equation 7.33 does not work directly for Equation 7.37; we now present a slightly more involved proof to show that Equation 7.37 is indeed the more general form of adiabatic invariant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Canonical coordinate-momentum plane.\n\n\n\nLet us define the radius vector in the \\(Q-P\\) plane to be \\(\\mathbf{R}=(Q,P)\\) and define unit vectors in the \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) directions by \\(\\hat{Q}\\) and \\(\\hat{P}\\); these definitions are shown in Figure 7.2. Furthermore, we define the \\(z\\) direction as being normal to the \\(Q-P\\) plane; thus, the unit vector \\(\\hat{z}=\\hat{Q}\\times\\hat{P}\\). Hamilton’s equations (\\(\\dot{P} = -\\partial H/\\partial Q,\\dot{Q}=\\partial H/\\partial P\\)) may be written in vector form as \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{R}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\hat{z}\\times\\nabla H\n\\tag{7.38}\\] where \\[\n\\nabla = \\hat{Q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q} + \\hat{P}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\n\\] is the gradient operator in the \\(Q-P\\) plane. Equation 7.38 shows that the phase-space “velocity” \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{R}/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is orthogonal ot \\(\\nabla H\\). Hence, \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) stays on a level contour of \\(H\\). If \\(H\\) is a constant, then, in order for the motion to be periodic, the path along this level contour must circle around and join itself, like a road of constant elevation around the rim of a mountain (or a crater). If \\(H\\) is not constant, but slowly changing in time, the contour will circle around and nearly join itself.\nEquation 7.38 can be inverted by crossing it with \\(\\hat{z}\\) to give \\[\n\\nabla H = \\hat{z}\\times\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{R}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{7.39}\\]\nFor periodic and near-periodic motions, \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{R}/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is always in the same sense (always clockwise or always counterclockwise). Thus, Equation 7.39 shows that an observer following the path would always see that \\(H\\) is increasing on the left-hand side of the path and decreasing on the right-hand side (or vice versa). For clarity, the origin of the \\(Q-P\\) plane is redefined to be at a local maximum or minimum of \\(H\\). Hence, near the extremum \\(H\\) must have the Taylor expansion \\[\nH(P,Q) = H_\\mathrm{extremum} + \\frac{P^2}{2}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 H}{\\partial P^2} \\right]_{P=0,Q=0} + \\frac{Q^2}{2}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 H}{\\partial Q^2} \\right]_{P=0,Q=0}\n\\] where the second order derivatives are either both positive (valley) or both negative (hill). Since \\(H\\) is assumed to have a slow dependence on time, these second derivatives will be time-dependent so that \\(H\\) has the form \\[\nH = \\alpha(t)\\frac{P^2}{2} + \\beta(t)\\frac{Q^2}{2}\n\\tag{7.40}\\] where \\(\\alpha(t)\\) and \\(\\beta(t)\\) have the same sign. The term \\(H_\\mathrm{extremum}\\) has been dropped because it is just an additive constant to the energy and does not affect Hamilton’s equations. From Equation 7.38 the direction of rotation of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is seen to be counterclockwise if the extremum of \\(H\\) is a hill, and clockwise if a valley.\nHamilton’s equations operating on Equation 7.40 give \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\beta Q,\\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\alpha P\n\\tag{7.41}\\]\nThese equations do not directly generate the simple harmonic oscillator equation because of the time dependence of \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\). However, if we define the auxiliary variable \\[\n\\tau = \\int^t \\beta(t^\\prime)\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime\n\\] then \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\beta\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\n\\] so Equation 7.41 becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = -Q,\\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}P\n\\tag{7.42}\\]\nSubstituting for \\(Q\\) in the right-hand equation using the left-hand equation gives \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2P}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}P = 0\n\\] which is a simple harmonic oscillator with \\(\\omega^2(\\tau) = \\alpha(\\tau)/\\beta(\\tau)\\). The action integral may be rewritten as \\[\nS = \\oint P\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\mathrm{d}\\tau\n\\] where the integral is over one period of the motion. Using Equation 7.42 and following the same procedure as was used with Equation 7.35, this becomes \\[\nS = \\oint P^2\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\mathrm{d}\\tau = \\lambda^2\\int \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\alpha(\\tau^\\prime)}{\\beta(\\tau^\\prime)} \\right)^{1/2}\\cos^2\\left( \\int^{\\tau^\\prime} (\\alpha/\\beta)^{1/2}\\mathrm{d}\\tau^{\\prime\\prime} \\right) \\right]\\mathrm{d}\\tau^\\prime\n\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a constant dependent on initial conditions. By introducing the orbit phase \\(\\phi=\\int^\\tau (\\alpha/\\beta)^{1/2}\\mathrm{d}\\tau\\), the above becomes \\[\nS = \\lambda^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\phi\\cos^2\\phi = \\mathrm{const}.\n\\]\nThus, the general action integral is indeed an adiabatic invariant. This proof is of course only valid in the vicinity of an extremum of \\(H\\), i.e., only where \\(H\\) can be adequately represented by Equation 7.40.\n\n\n7.8.3 Proof for the general adiabatic invariant\nWe now develop a proof for the general adiabatic invariant. This proof is not restricted to small oscillations (i.e., being near an extremum of \\(H\\)) as was the previous discussion. Let the Hamiltonian depend on time via a slowly changing parameter \\(\\lambda(t)\\), so that \\(H=H(P,Q,\\lambda(t))\\). From Equation 4.6 the energy is given by \\[\nE(t) = H(P,Q,\\lambda(t))\n\\tag{7.43}\\] and, in principle, this relation can be inverted to give \\(P=P(E(t),Q,\\lambda(t))\\). Suppose a particle is executing nearly periodic motion in the \\(Q-P\\) plane. We define the turning point \\(Q_{tp}\\) as a position where \\(\\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}t=0\\). Since \\(Q\\) is oscillating, there will be a turning point associated with \\(Q\\) having its maximum value and a turning point associated with \\(Q\\) having its minimum value. From now on let us only consider turning points where \\(Q\\) has its maximum value, that is, we only consider the turning points on the right-hand side of the nearly periodic trajectories in the \\(Q-P\\) plane shown in Figure 7.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Nearly periodic-phase space trajectory for slowly changing Hamiltonian. The turning point \\(Q_{tp}(t)\\) is where \\(Q\\) is at its maximum.\n\n\n\nIf the motion is periodic, then the turning point for the \\(N+1^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) period will be the same as the turning point for the \\(N^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) period, but if the motion is only nearly periodic, there will be a slight difference as shown in Figure 7.3. This difference can be characterized by making the turning point a function of time so \\(Q_{tp}=Q_{tp}(t)\\). This function is only defined for the times when \\(\\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}t = 0\\). When the motion is not exactly periodic, this turning point is such that \\(Q_{tp}(t+\\tau)\\neq Q_{tp}(t)\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is the time interval required for the particle to go from the first turning point to the next turning point. The action integral is over one entire period of oscillation starting from a right-hand turning point and then going to the next right-hand turning point and so can be written as \\[\nS = \\oint P\\mathrm{d}Q = \\int_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\\tau)}P\\mathrm{d}Q\n\\]\nFrom Equation 4.6 it is seen that \\(P/m\\) is not, in general, the velocity and so the velocity \\(\\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is not, in general, proportional to \\(P\\) (???). Thus, the turning points are not necessarily at the locations where \\(P\\) vanishes, and in fact \\(P\\) need not change sign during a period. However, \\(S\\) still corresponds to the area of phase-space enclosed by one period of the phase-space trajectory.\nWe can now calculate \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\\tau)}P(E(t),Q,\\lambda(t))\\mathrm{d}Q \\\\\n&= \\left[ P\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right]_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\\tau)} + \\int_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\\tau)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}_Q \\right)\\mathrm{d}Q \\\\\n&= \\int_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\\tau)} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial E} \\right)_{Q,\\lambda}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right)_{Q,E}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right]\\mathrm{d}Q\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.44}\\]\nBecause \\(\\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}t = 0\\) at the turning point, the integrated term vanishes and so there is no contribution from motion of the turning point. From Equation 7.43 we have \\[\n1 = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P}\\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial E} \\right)_{Q,\\lambda}\n\\] and \\[\n0 = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P}\\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right)_{Q,E} + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial\\lambda}\n\\] so Equation 7.44 becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\oint \\left( \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P} \\right)^{-1} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial\\lambda}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right]\\mathrm{d}Q\n\\tag{7.45}\\]\nFrom Equation 7.43 we have \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial Q}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\lambda}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial\\lambda}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{7.46}\\] since the first two terms canceled due to Hamilton’s equations. Substitution of Equation 7.46 into Equation 7.45 gives \\(\\mathrm{d}S/\\mathrm{d}t=0\\), completing the proof of adiabatic invariance. No assumption has been made here that \\(P,Q\\) are close to the values associated with an extremum of \\(H\\).\nThis proof seems too neat, because it has established adiabatic invariance simply by careful use of the chain rule, and by taking partial derivatives. However, this observation reveals the underlying essence of adiabaticity, namely it is the differentiability of \\(H, P\\) with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) from one period to the next and the Hamilton nature of the system, which together provide the conditions for the adiabatic invariant to exist. If the motion had been such that after one cycle the motion had changed so drastically that taking a derivative of \\(H\\) or \\(P\\) with respect to would not make sense, then the adiabatic invariant would not exist.\n\n\n7.8.4 The First Adiabatic Invariant\nWe have already met the quantity \\[\n\\mu = mv_\\perp^2 / 2B\n\\] and have proved its invariance in spatially and temporally varying \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) fields. The periodic motion involved, of course, is the Larmor gyration. If we take \\(p\\) to be angular momentum \\(mv_\\perp r\\) and \\(dq\\) to be the coordinate \\(\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\), the action integral becomes \\[\n\\oint p dq = \\oint mv_\\perp r \\mathrm{d}\\theta = 2\\pi r_L m v_\\perp = 2\\pi \\frac{mv_\\perp^2}{\\omega_c} = 4\\pi \\frac{m}{|q|}\\mu\n\\]\nThus \\(\\mu\\) is a constant of the motion as long as \\(q/m\\) is not changed. We have proved the invariance of \\(\\mu\\) only with the implicit assumption \\(\\omega/\\omega_c \\ll 1\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a frequency characterizing the rate of change of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) as seen by the particle. A proof exists, however, that \\(\\mu\\) is invariant even when \\(\\omega/\\omega_c \\le q\\). In theorists’ language, \\(\\mu\\) is invariant “to all orders in an expansion in \\(\\omega/\\omega_c\\).” What this means in practice is that \\(\\mu\\) remains much more nearly constant than \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) does during one period of gyration.\nIt is just as important to know when an adiabatic invariant does not exist as to know when it does. Adiabatic invariance of μ is violated when ω is not small compared with \\(\\omega_c\\) . We give three examples of this.\n\nMagnetic Pumping. If the strength of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in a mirror confinement system is varied sinusoidally, the particles’ \\(v_\\perp\\) would oscillate; but there would be no gain of energy in the long run. However, if the particles make collisions, the invariance of μ is violated, and the plasma can be heated. In particular, a particle making a collision during the compression phase can transfer part of its gyration energy into \\(v_\\parallel\\) energy, and this is not taken out again in the expansion phase.\nCyclotron Heating. Now imagine that the \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field is oscillated at the frequency \\(\\omega_c\\). The induced electric field will then rotate in phase with some of the particles and accelerate their Larmor motion continuously. The condition \\(\\omega\\ll \\omega_c\\) is violated, μ is not conserved, and the plasma can be heated.\nMagnetic Cusps. If the current in one of the coils in a simple magnetic mirror system is reversed, a magnetic cusp is formed. This configuration has, in addition to the usual mirrors, a spindle-cusp mirror extending over \\(360^\\circ\\) in azimuth. A plasma confined in a cusp device is supposed to have better stability properties than that in an ordinary mirror. Unfortunately, the loss-cone losses are larger because of the additional loss region; and the particle motion is nonadiabatic. Since the \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field vanishes at the center of symmetry, \\(\\omega_c\\) is zero there; and μ is not preserved. The local Larmor radius near the center is larger than the device. Because of this, the adiabatic invariant μ does not guarantee that particles outside a loss cone will stay outside after passing through the nonadiabatic region. Fortunately, there is in this case another invariant: the canonical angular momentum \\(p_\\theta = mrv_\\theta - erA_\\theta\\). This ensures that there will be a population of particles trapped indefinitely until they make a collision.\n\n\n\n7.8.5 The Second Adiabatic Invariant\nConsider a particle trapped between two magnetic mirrors: it bounces between them and therefore has a periodic motion at the “bounce frequency”. A constant of this motion is given by \\(\\oint mv_\\parallel ds\\), where \\(ds\\) is an element of path length (of the guiding center) along a field line. However, since the guiding center drifts across field lines, the motion is not exactly periodic, and the constant of the motion becomes an adiabatic invariant. This is called the longitudinal invariant \\(J\\) and is defined for a half-cycle between the two turning points \\[\nJ = \\int_a^b v_\\parallel ds\n\\]\nWe shall prove that \\(J\\) is invariant in a static, nonuniform B field; the result is also true for a slowly time-varying B field.\nBefore embarking on this somewhat lengthy proof, let us consider an example of the type of problem in which a theorem on the invariance of \\(J\\) would be useful. As we have already seen, the earth’s magnetic field mirror-traps charged particles, which slowly drift in longitude around the earth. If the magnetic field were perfectly symmetric, the particle would eventually drift back to the same magnetic field line. However, the actual field is distorted by such effects as the solar wind. In that case, will a particle ever come back to the same magnetic field line? Since the particle’s energy is conserved and is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{2} mv_\\perp^2\\) at the turning point, the invariance of μ indicates that \\(|B|\\) remains the same at the turning point. However, upon drifting back to the same longitude, a particle may find itself on another magnetic field line at a different altitude. This cannot happen if \\(J\\) is conserved. \\(J\\) determines the length of the field lines between turning points, and no two lines have the same length between points with the same \\(|B|\\). Consequently, the particle returns to the same magnetic field line even in a slightly asymmetric field.\nTo prove the invariance of \\(J\\), we first consider the invariance of \\(v_\\parallel \\delta s\\), where \\(\\delta s\\) is a segment of the path along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Because of guiding center drifts, a particle on \\(s\\) will find itself on another magnetic field line \\(\\delta s^\\prime\\) after a time \\(\\Delta t\\). The length of \\(\\delta s^\\prime\\) is defined by passing planes perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) through the end points of \\(\\delta s\\). The length of \\(\\delta s\\) is obviously proportional to the radius of curvature: \\[\n\\frac{\\delta s}{R_c} = \\frac{\\delta s^\\prime}{R_c^\\prime}\n\\] so that \\[\n\\frac{\\delta s^\\prime - \\delta s}{\\Delta t \\delta s} = \\frac{R_c^\\prime - R_c}{\\Delta t R_c}\n\\]\nThe “radial” component of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{gc}\\) is just \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{gc}\\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c} = \\frac{R_c^\\prime - R_c}{\\Delta t}\n\\]\nThe guiding center drift in curved vacuum field is \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \\mathbf{v}_c + \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}v_\\perp r_L\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla B}{B^2} + \\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c \\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}\n\\]\nThe curvature drift has no component along \\(\\mathbf{R}_c\\). Using the above three equations, we have\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\delta s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\delta s = \\mathbf{v}_{gs} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m}{q}\\frac{v_\\perp^2}{B^3}(\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla B)\\cdot\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}\n\\]\nThis is the rate of change of \\(\\delta s\\) as seen by the particle. We must now get the rate of change of \\(v_\\parallel\\) as seen by the particle. The parallel and perpendicular energies are defined by\n\\[\nW \\equiv \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\mu B \\equiv W_\\parallel + W_\\perp\n\\]\nThus \\(v_\\parallel\\) can be written \\[\nv_\\parallel = \\left[ \\frac{2}{m}(W - \\mu B) \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\nHere W and μ are constant, and only B varies. Therefore, \\[\n\\frac{\\dot{v}_\\parallel}{v_\\parallel} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mu\\dot{B}}{W - \\mu B} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mu \\dot{B}}{W_\\parallel} = -\\frac{\\mu\\dot{B}}{mv_\\parallel^2}\n\\]\nSince B was assumed static, \\(\\dot{B}\\) is not zero only because of the guiding center motion: \\[\n\\dot{B} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v}_{gc}\\cdot\\nabla B = \\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{R}_c \\times\\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2} \\cdot\\nabla B\n\\]\nNow we have \\[\n\\frac{\\dot{v}_\\parallel}{v_\\parallel} = -\\frac{\\mu}{q}\\frac{(\\mathbf{R}_c\\times\\mathbf{B})\\cdot\\nabla B}{R_c^2 B^2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m}{q}\\frac{v_\\perp^2}{B} \\frac{(\\mathbf{R}_c\\times\\mathbf{B})\\cdot\\nabla B}{R_c^2 B^2}\n\\]\nThe fractional change in \\(v_\\parallel \\delta s\\) is \\[\n\\frac{1}{v_\\parallel \\delta s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(v_\\parallel \\delta s) = \\frac{1}{\\delta s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\delta s}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{v_\\parallel}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_\\parallel}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\]\nFrom the previous derivations we see that the these two terms cancel, so that \\[\nv_\\parallel \\delta s = \\textrm{constant}\n\\]\nThis is not exactly the same as saying that \\(J\\) is constant, however. In taking the integral of \\(v_\\parallel \\delta s\\), between the turning points, it may be that the turning points on \\(\\delta s^\\prime\\) do not coincide with the intersections of the perpendicular planes. However, any error in \\(J\\) arising from such a discrepancy is negligible because near the turning points, \\(v_\\parallel\\) is nearly zero. Consequently, we have proved \\[\nJ = \\int_a^b v_\\parallel ds = \\textrm{constant}\n\\]\nAn example of the violation of J invariance is given by a plasma heating scheme called transit-time magnetic pumping. Suppose an oscillating current is applied to the coils of a mirror system so that the mirrors alternately approach and withdraw from each other near the bounce frequency. Those particles that have the right bounce frequency will always see an approaching mirror and will therefore gain \\(v_\\parallel\\). \\(J\\) is not conserved in this case because the change of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) occurs on a time scale not long compared with the bounce time.\n\n\n7.8.6 The Third Adiabatic Invariant\nReferring again to the earth dipole case, we see that the slow drift of a guiding center around the earth constitutes a third type of periodic motion. The adiabatic invariant connected with this turns out to be the total magnetic flux \\(\\Phi\\) enclosed by the drift surface, \\[\n\\Phi = \\int\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}\n\\tag{7.47}\\]\nIt is almost obvious that, as \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) varies, the particle will stay on a surface such that the total number of magnetic field lines enclosed remains constant. This invariant, \\(\\Phi\\), has few applications because most fluctuations of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) occur on a time scale short compared with the drift period. As an example of the violation of \\(\\Phi\\) invariance, we can cite some recent work on the excitation of ultra-low frequency magnetohydrodynamic waves in the ionosphere. These waves have a long period comparable to the drift time of a particle around the earth. The particles can therefore encounter the wave in the same phase each time around. If the phase is right, the wave can be excited by the conversion of particle drift energy to wave energy.\nHere are some time scales to remember for a 1 MeV electron/ion in the Earth’s radiation belt at L shell 4 from Solène Lejosne’s calculator:\n\n\n\nType\nGyroperiod\nBounce period\nDrift period3\n\n\n\n\n1 MeV electron\n0.22 ms\n0.22 s\n16 mins\n\n\n1 MeV ion\n135 ms\n5.5 s\n11 mins\n\n\n\nIn radiation belt studies, it is typical to consider a quantity that is inversely proportional to the magnetic flux: \\[\nL^\\ast = \\frac{2\\pi M}{|\\phi|R_E} = \\frac{2\\pi B_{eq}R_E^2}{|\\phi|}\n\\tag{7.48}\\] where \\(M\\) is the magnetic moment of the Earth’s dipole field, \\(R_E\\) is the radius of the Earth, and \\(B_{eq}\\) is the magnetic field strength at the equatorial surface. This presentation of the third invariant is termed \\(L^\\ast\\), or Roederer’s \\(L\\) parameter, which is the radial distance to the equatorial point where the particle would be found if all nondipolar perturbations in the geomagnetic field were adiabatically turned off leaving only the dipole field (Roederer, 1970). It should be noted that in a nondipolar field \\(L^\\ast\\) does not represent a spatial coordinate, instead \\(L^\\ast\\) is a property of a stably trapped particle (Roederer and Lejosne, 2018). That is, in absence of acceleration or loss processes, \\(L^\\ast\\) defines a surface with constant phase space density. If a particle encounter a boundary of the radiation belt system (i.e. the magnetopause or atmosphere) during its drift leading to its loss from the system, the particle does not have an \\(L^\\ast\\) value. The particle is said to be in the drift loss cone.\nTherefore, the \\(L\\) and \\(L^\\ast\\) parameters coincide in a dipole field, but in a nondipolar field, these parameters are different. Typically, \\(L\\) is used with particle fluxes whereas \\(L^\\ast\\) is better suited for phase space density. An interesting phenomenon from a nondipolar field is the drift-shell splitting, as been proposed as one of the mechanisms for causing the pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere (Chapter 22).",

    "section": "7.9 Ring Current",
    "text": "7.9 Ring Current\nOne typical application of the single particle motion is the study of ring current. Beyond the lowest order of motion (i.e. gyration combined with parallel drift) of charged particles in the magnetosphere, let us examine the higher order corrections. For the case of non-time-varying fields, and a weak electric field, these corrections consist of a combination of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift, grad-\\(B\\) drift, and curvature drift: \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{1\\perp} = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} + \\frac{\\mu}{m\\Omega}\\hat{b}\\times\\nabla B + \\frac{v_\\parallel^2}{\\Omega}\\hat{b}\\times(\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla)\\hat{b}\n\\]\nLet us neglect the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift, since this motion merely gives rise to the convection of plasma within the magnetosphere, without generating a current. By contrast, there is a net current associated with grad-\\(B\\) drift and curvature drift. In the limit in which this current does not strongly modify the ambient magnetic field (i.e., \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} \\simeq \\mathbf{0}\\)), which is certainly the situation in the Earth’s magnetosphere, we can write \\[\n(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\,\\mathbf{B} =-\\mathbf{B}\\times(\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B})\\simeq \\frac{\\nabla_\\perp B}{B}\n\\]\nIt follows that the higher order drifts can be combined to give \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{1\\perp} = \\frac{(v_\\perp^{~2}/2+v_\\parallel^{~2})}{{\\Omega}\\,B}\\, \\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla B\n\\]\nFor the dipole field Equation 3.6, the above expression yields \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{1\\perp} \\simeq -\\mathrm{sgn}({\\Omega})\\,\\frac{6\\,\\mathcal{E} L^2}{eB_E R_E}(1-B/2B_m)\\frac{\\cos^5\\vartheta(1+\\sin^2\\vartheta)}{(1+3\\sin^2\\vartheta)^2}\\,\\hat{\\varphi}\n\\tag{7.49}\\] where \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is the energy of the particle, \\(B_E\\) is the equatorial magnetic field-strength on the Earth’s surface, and \\(B_m\\) is the magnetic field-strength at the mirror points. Note that the drift is in the azimuthal direction. A positive drift velocity corresponds to eastward motion, whereas a negative velocity corresponds to westward motion. It is clear that, in addition to their gyromotion and periodic bouncing motion along field lines, charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere also slowly precess around the Earth. The ions drift westwards and the electrons drift eastwards, giving rise to a net westward current circulating around the Earth. This current is known as the ring current.\nAlthough the perturbations to the Earth’s magnetic field induced by the ring current are small, they are still detectable. In fact, the ring current causes a slight reduction in the Earth’s magnetic field in equatorial regions. The size of this reduction is a good measure of the number of charged particles contained in the Van Allen belts (Chapter 24). During the development of so-called geomagnetic storms, charged particles are injected into the Van Allen belts from the outer magnetosphere, giving rise to a sharp increase in the ring current, and a corresponding decrease in the Earth’s equatorial magnetic field. These particles eventually precipitate out of the magnetosphere into the upper atmosphere at high latitudes, giving rise to intense auroral activity, serious interference in electromagnetic communications, and, in extreme cases, disruption of electric power grids. The ring current induced reduction in the Earth’s magnetic field is measured by the so-called Dst index, which is based on hourly averages of the northward horizontal component of the terrestrial magnetic field recorded at four low-latitude observatories; Honolulu (Hawaii), San Juan (Puerto Rico), Hermanus (South Africa), and Kakioka (Japan). A reduction in the Dst index by 600 nT corresponds to a \\(2\\%\\) reduction in the terrestrial magnetic field at the equator.\nAccording to Equation 7.49, the precessional drift velocity of charged particles in the magnetosphere is a rapidly decreasing function of increasing latitude (i.e., most of the ring current is concentrated in the equatorial plane). Since particles typically complete many bounce orbits during a full rotation around the Earth, it is convenient to average Equation 7.49 over a bounce period to obtain the average drift velocity. This averaging can only be performed numerically. The final answer is well approximated by \\[\n\\langle v_d\\rangle \\simeq \\frac{6\\,\\mathcal{E}\\,L^2}{e\\,B_E\\,R_E} \\,(0.35 + 0.15\\,\\sin\\alpha_\\mathrm{eq})\n\\tag{7.50}\\]\nThe average drift period (i.e., the time required to perform a complete rotation around the Earth) is simply \\[\n\\langle \\tau_d\\rangle = \\frac{2\\pi\\,L\\,R_E}{\\langle v_d\\rangle}\\simeq\\frac{\\pi e B_E R_E^2}{3\\,\\mathcal{E}\\,L}\\,(0.35 + 0.15\\,\\sin\\alpha_\\mathrm{eq})^{-1}\n\\]\nThus, the drift period for protons and electrons is \\[\n\\langle \\tau_d\\rangle_p=\\langle \\tau_d\\rangle_e \\simeq \\frac{1.05}{\\mathcal{E}(\\text{MeV})L}\\,(1+0.43\\,\\sin\\alpha_\\mathrm{eq})^{-1}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{hours}\n\\]\nNote that MeV energy electrons and ions precess around the Earth with about the same velocity, only in opposite directions, because there is no explicit mass dependence in Equation 7.50. It typically takes \\(\\sim 20\\) mins to perform a full rotation. The drift period only depends weakly on the equatorial pitch angle \\(\\alpha_\\mathrm{eq}\\), as is the case for the bounce period. Somewhat paradoxically, the drift period is shorter on more distant \\(L\\)-shells. Note, of course, that particles only get a chance to complete a full rotation around the Earth if the inner magnetosphere remains quiescent on time-scales of order an hour, which is, by no means, always the case.\nNote that since the rest mass of an electron is \\(0.511\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2\\), most of the above formulae require relativistic correction when applied to MeV energy electrons. Fortunately, however, there is no such problem for protons, whose rest mass energy is \\(0.938\\,\\mathrm{GeV}/c^2\\).\nCurrent theory suggests that the lower latitude (compared with the region I current) region II current is closely linked to the ring current, or more precisely, the partial ring current (substorm current wedge?) on the nightside. The ring current is generated from supra-thermal electrons and ions but not the thermal portion, thus requires extra care on the high energy tail distribution which may not be present in a model that only resolves the thermal part.",

    "section": "7.10 Particle Acceleration",
    "text": "7.10 Particle Acceleration\n\nFermi acceleration is the acceleration that charged particles undergo when being repeatedly reflected, usually by a magnetic mirror. This is sometimes referred to as diffusive shock acceleration, which is actually a subclass of Fermi acceleration (Axford, Leer, and Skadron 1977). There are two types of Fermi acceleration: first-order Fermi acceleration (in shocks) and second-order Fermi acceleration (in the environment of moving magnetized gas clouds). In both cases the environment has to be collisionless in order for the mechanism to be effective. This is because Fermi acceleration only applies to particles with energies exceeding the thermal energies, and frequent collisions with surrounding particles will cause severe energy loss and as a result no acceleration will occur. See more in wiki and (Fermi 1949).\nBetatron acceleration refers to situations in which the magnetic field strength increases slowly in time (compared with a gyroperiod), so that \\(\\mu\\) remains constant, but the particle kinetic energy is not constant due to the presence of electric fields (associated with the time-varying magnetic field). Then, the perpendicular energy is increased due to constancy of \\(\\mu\\).\nShock drift acceleration. Gradients within the shock transition region may give rise to the phenomenon of Shock Drift Acceleration (SDA), where ions travel along the shock front and gyrate through the ramp multiple times before either passing into the downstream or escaping into the upstream region. The sudden compression of the plasma creates complex electric field that can accelerate charged particles.\n\nParticle accelerations are important consequences of magnetic reconnection and shocks. In magnetic reconnection processes, the energy is rapidly converted from magnetic field to particles in the forms of flows, bulk (“thermal”) heating, and high-energy (“nonthermal”) tails. (Ji et al. 2022) describes the current understanding of electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection in the non-relativistic and relativistic regimes. First-principles numerical simulations suggest power-law nonthermal particle populations are more prevalent in systems with low \\(\\beta\\) and moderate guide (perpendicular to the reconnection plane) magnetic fields, with acceleration efficiency enhanced in 3D compared to simplified 2D calculations. Multiple acceleration mechanisms have been studied. In the localized diffusion region near an X-line without a guide field, particles may become demagnetized, prone to be directly accelerated by the reconnection electric field as they undergo so-called Speiser or meandering orbits. There is recent laboratory evidence for electron acceleration by this mechanism in action during magnetically driven reconnection at low-\\(\\beta\\) using laser-powered capacitor coils. There is also numerical evidence that a substantial fraction of dissipated magnetic energy is carried by particles accelerated by this mechanism when they are demagnetized and escape from plasmoids in 3D.\nOver larger scales when the particles remain magnetized, there are three basic particle acceleration processes that dominate in collisionless reconnection: Fermi acceleration which takes place as particles stream along and drift in relaxing curved magnetic field lines, relatively localized electric fields \\(E_\\parallel\\) parallel to the magnetic field directly accelerate particles, and betatron heating which occurs as particles drift into regions of stronger magnetic field while conserving the first adiabatic moment \\(\\mu=mv_\\perp^2/B\\). These mechanisms are described by guiding center equations of motion for the particles, and the energization rate in the non-relativistic limit is given approximately by the following equation: \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{E}}{dt} = qE_\\parallel v_\\parallel + \\mu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} + q\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_c + \\frac{1}{2}m\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}|\\mathbf{u}_E|^2\n\\tag{7.51}\\] where \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is the energy of a particle, \\(\\mathbf{u}_E\\) is the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift velocity, \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}_E\\cdot\\nabla\\), \\(E_\\parallel\\) is the parallel electric field, and \\(v_\\parallel\\) is the drift-corrected guiding center parallel velocity. For slowly varying fields, \\(\\mathbf{u}_c\\) is the curvature drift of particles and reduces to \\(\\mathbf{u}_c \\sim(mv_\\parallel^2/qB)(\\hat{b}\\times\\pmb{\\kappa})\\), where \\(\\pmb{\\kappa}=\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{b}\\) is the magnetic field curvature and \\(\\hat{b}\\) is the unit vector in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The terms on the right-hand side represent energy gain by the parallel electric field, betatron heating, Fermi acceleration, and the polarization drift respectively. The first three mechanisms are sketched in Figure 7.4. The polarization drift is particularly important for lower-energy ions, and this terms accounts for the kinetic energy gain in the large-scale reconnection outflow jets. Although Equation 7.51 is valid in the non-relativistic limit, the same basic acceleration mechanisms are responsible for energizing particles in more extreme relativistic contexts relevant to astrophysical systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Illustration of particle acceleration mechanisms. The reconnection electric field is along the \\(y\\) direction. Acceleration by the reconnection electric field occurs near the X-line, which is associated with the Speiser orbit, and by parallel electric field near separatrices, which are boundaries between upstream (before-reconnection) and downstream (after-reconnection) regions. When particles near the X-line interact with the parallel electric field, ions (electrons) are accelerated along the (opposite) direction of the field, and the direct acceleration term \\(qE_\\parallel v_\\parallel\\) (the first term on the right side of Equation 7.51) is positive. The betatron acceleration mechanism happens when particles flow into the stronger magnetic field regions in the exhaust. In this example trajectory, particles move along the positive z direction by the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) motion and \\(\\nabla B\\) is also along the positive z direction. As a result, the second term of Equation 7.51 is positive. Fermi acceleration occurs in the regions with high-curvature magnetic field lines. In this example, plasmoids are elongated along the \\(z\\) direction, such that the field lines have the highest curvature at \\(x = 0\\). Inside the plasmoid, particles obtain a large velocity kick along the \\(y\\) direction due to a large curvature drift and obtain a significant energy from the reconnection electric field (\\(q\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_c &gt; 0\\)). In the exhaust region, trapped particles gain energy whenever they pass the high curvature regions at \\(x = 0\\). di is ion skin depth. Figure 5 from (Ji et al. 2022)\n\n\n\nParticles gain energy when their drift induced by the curvature of the magnetic field lines is aligned with the reconnection electric field, which is a form of Fermi heating. Fermi acceleration may resolve two major challenges for heating models. First, it may operate over large volumes in the presence of many magnetic islands or plasmoids, which may be sampled by electrons in the presence of 3D ergodic field lines. There are several space observations of energetic electrons near magnetic islands or plasmoids. Second, the Fermi process naturally generates power laws because a particle undergoing Fermi acceleration gains energy at a rate proportional to its energy, \\(\\delta\\mathcal{E}\\propto \\mathcal{E}\\). In the non-relativistic limit, adiabatic particle energization by Fermi acceleration along with the other heating mechanisms for magnetized particles leads to a Parker-like transport equation for the distribution \\(f(v_\\parallel, v_\\perp)\\) of particles within a magnetic flux tube including time-varying plasma density \\(n\\) and magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\dot{B}}{B}v_\\perp^2\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_\\perp^2} + \\left( \\frac{\\dot{n}}{n} - \\frac{\\dot{B}}{B} \\right)v_\\parallel\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_\\parallel} = \\frac{D\\{ f \\}}{\\tau_\\text{diff}} - \\frac{f}{\\tau_\\text{esc}} + \\frac{f_\\text{inj}}{\\tau_\\text{inj}}\n\\tag{7.52}\\] where \\(\\frac{D\\{ f \\}}{\\tau_\\text{diff}}\\) includes diffusive processes such as pitch-angle or energy scattering, \\(\\tau_\\text{esc}\\) is a typical time for particles to escape the reconnection geometry, and \\(f_\\text{inj}/\\tau_\\text{inj}\\) is a source of newly injected particles. This transport equation leads to power-law solutions under certain assumptions, though the Fermi process becomes much less effective at generating power-law nonthermal tails in the presence of a significant guide magnetic field component. With certain assumptions, it is possible to solve the Parker equation using the velocity and magnetic fields from MHD simulations to obtain predictions of the particle acceleration, but this approach does not include the self-consistent feedback.",

In a plasma, the ions and electrons comprising the plasma are the equivalent of the “bound” charges and currents. Since these charges move in a complicated way, it is impractical to try to lump their effects into two constants \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\mu\\). Consequently, in plasma physics, one generally works with the vacuum equations, in which \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) include all the charges and currents, both external and internal.\nNote that we have used \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in the vacuum equations rather than their counterparts \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), which are related by the constants \\(\\epsilon_0\\) and \\(\\mu_0\\). This is because the forces \\(q\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) depend on \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) rather than \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), and it is not necessary to introduce the latter quantities as long as one is dealing with the vacuum equations.\n\n\n8.2.2 Classical Treatment of Magnetic Materials\nSince each gyrating particle has a magnetic moment, it would seem that the logical thing to do would be to consider a plasma as a magnetic material with a permeability \\(\\mu_m\\). ((We have put a subscript \\(m\\) on the permeability to distinguish it from the adiabatic invariant \\(\\mu\\).) To see why this is not done in practice, let us review the way magnetic materials are usually treated.\nThe ferromagnetic domains, say, of a piece of iron have magnetic moments \\(\\mu_i\\), giving rise to a bulk magnetization\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\frac{1}{V}\\sum_i\\mu_i\n\\]\nper unit volume. This has the same effect as a bound current density equal to\n\\[\n\\mathbf{J}_b = \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M}\n\\]\nIn the vacuum Ampère’s law, we must include in \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) both this current and the “free”, or externally applied, current \\(\\mathbf{J}_f\\):\n\\[\n\\mu_0^{-1}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{J}_f + \\mathbf{J}_b + \\epsilon_0 \\dot{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\]\nWe wish to write this equation in the simple form\n\\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_f + \\epsilon_0\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\]\nby including \\(\\mathbf{J}_b\\) in the definition of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). This can be done if we let\n\\[\n\\mathbf{H} = \\mu_0^{-1}\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{M}\n\\]\nTo get a simple relation between \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), we assume \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) to be proportional to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{H}\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\chi_m \\mathbf{H}\n\\]\nThe constant \\(\\chi_m\\) is the magnetic susceptibility. We now have\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0(1+\\chi_m)\\mathbf{H} \\equiv \\mu_m \\mathbf{H}\n\\]\nThis simple relation between \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is possible because of the linear relation between \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\).\nIn a plasma with a magnetic field, each particle has a magnetic moment \\(\\mu_\\alpha\\), and the quantity \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is the sum of all these \\(\\mu_\\alpha\\)’s in 1 \\(\\text{m}^3\\). But now we have\n\\[\n\\mu_\\alpha = \\frac{mv_{\\perp\\alpha}^2}{2B}\\propto \\frac{1}{B}\\quad \\mathbf{M}\\propto \\frac{1}{B}\n\\]\nThe relation between \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) is no longer linear, and we cannot write \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_m\\mathbf{H}\\) with \\(\\mu_m\\) constant. It is therefore not useful to consider a plasma as a magnetic medium.\n\n\n8.2.3 Classical Treatment of Dielectrics\nThe polarization \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) per unit volume is the sum over all the individual moments \\(\\mathbf{p}_i\\) of the electric dipoles. This gives rise to a bound charge density\n\\[\n\\sigma_b = -\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P}\n\\tag{8.3}\\]\nIn the vacuum equation, we must include both the bound charge and the free charge:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\sigma_f + \\sigma_b\n\\]\nWe wish to write this in the simple form\n\\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{D} = \\sigma_f\n\\]\nby including \\(\\sigma_b\\) in the definition of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\). This can be done by letting\n\\[\n\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P} \\equiv \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is linearly proportional to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\),\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\epsilon_0 \\chi_e\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nthen \\(\\epsilon\\) is a constant given by\n\\[\n\\epsilon = (1+\\chi_e)\\epsilon_0\n\\]\nThere is no a priori reason why a relation like the above cannot be valid in a plasma, so we may proceed to try to get an expression for \\(\\epsilon\\) in a plasma.\n\n\n8.2.4 The Dielectric Constant of a Plasma\nWe have seen in Section 7.4 that a fluctuating \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field gives rise to a polarization current \\(\\mathbf{J}_p\\). This leads, in turn, to a polarization charge given by the equation of continuity:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_p}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J}_p = 0\n\\]\nThis is the equivalent of Equation 8.3, except that, as we noted before, a polarization effect does not arise in a plasma unless the electric field is time varying. Since we have an explicit expression for \\(\\mathbf{J}_p\\) but not for \\(\\sigma_p\\), it is easier to work with the Ampère’s law:\n\\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0(\\mathbf{J}_f +\\mathbf{J}_p + \\epsilon\\dot{\\mathbf{E}})\n\\]\nWe wish to write this in the form\n\\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0(\\mathbf{J}_f + \\epsilon\\dot{\\mathbf{E}})\n\\]\nThis can be done if we let\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\epsilon_0 + \\frac{j_p}{\\dot{E}}\n\\]\nFrom Equation 7.12 for \\(\\mathbf{J}_p\\), we have\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\epsilon_0 + \\frac{\\rho}{B^2}\\quad \\text{or}\\quad \\epsilon_R\\equiv \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0} = 1+\\frac{\\mu_0\\rho c^2}{B^2}\n\\tag{8.4}\\]\nThis is the low-frequency plasma dielectric constant for transverse motions. The qualifications are necessary because our expression for \\(\\mathbf{J}_p\\) is valid only for \\(\\omega^2\\ll\\omega_c^2\\) and for \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The general expression for \\(\\epsilon\\), of course, is very complicated and hardly fits on one page.\nNote that as \\(\\rho\\rightarrow 0\\), \\(\\epsilon_R\\) approaches its vacuum value, unity, as it should. As \\(B\\rightarrow\\infty\\), \\(\\epsilon_R\\) also approaches unity. This is because the polarization drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) then vanishes, and the particles do not move in response to the transverse electric field. In a usual laboratory plasma, the second term in Equation 8.4 is large compared with unity. For instance, if \\(n=10^{16}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\) and \\(B=0.1\\,\\text{T}\\) we have (for hydrogen) \\[\n\\frac{\\mu_0\\rho c^2}{B^2} = \\frac{(4\\pi\\times 10^{-7})(10^{16})(1.67\\times 10^{-27})(3\\times 10^8)^2}{(0.1)^2} = 189\n\\]\nThis means that the electric fields due to the particles in the plasma greatly alter the fields applied externally. A plasma with large \\(\\epsilon\\) shields out alternating fields, just as a plasma with small \\(\\lambda_D\\) shields out dc fields.",

In (Bellan 2008), this is introduced in chapter 2 where Vlasov equation is first derived and then follows the simplifications which lead to 2-fluid and MHD.\n\n8.3.1 Equation of Continuity\nThe integral form of mass conservation for each species is \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_V \\rho_s dx^3=0\n\\]\nThe conservation of matter requires that the total number of particles \\(N_s\\) in a volume V can change only if there is a net flux of particles across the surface S bounding that volume. Since the particle flux density is \\(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s\\), we have, by the divergence theorem, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial N_s}{\\partial t} = \\int_V\\frac{\\partial n_s}{\\partial t}dV = -\\oint n\\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S} = - \\int_V \\nabla\\cdot(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s)dV\n\\]\nSince this must hold for any volume V, the integrands must be equal: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s) = 0\n\\tag{8.5}\\]\nThere is one such equation of continuity for each species. Any sources or sinks of particles are to be added to the right-hand side.\n\n\n8.3.2 Momentum Equation\nMaxwell’s equations tell us what \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are for a given state of the plasma. To solve the self-consistent problem, we must also have an equation giving the plasma’s response to given \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). In the fluid approximation, we consider the plasma to be composed of two or more interpenetrating fluids, one for each species. In the simplest case, when there is only one species of ion, we shall need two equations of motion, one for the positively charged ion fluid and one for the negatively charged electron fluid. In a partially ionized gas, we shall also need an equation for the fluid of neutral atoms. The neutral fluid will interact with the ions and electrons only through collisions. The ion and electron fluids will interact with each other even in the absence of collisions, because of the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) fields they generate.\nThe equation of motion for a single particle is \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\tag{8.6}\\]\nAssume first that there are no collisions and no thermal motions. Then all the particles in a fluid element move together, and the average velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) of the particles in the element is the same as the individual particle velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The fluid equation is obtained simply by multiplying Equation 8.6 by the density \\(n\\): \\[\nmn\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = qn(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\tag{8.7}\\]\nThis is, however, not a convenient form to use. In Equation 8.6, the time derivative is to be taken at the position of the particles. On the other hand, we wish to have an equation for fluid elements fixed in space, because it would be impractical to do otherwise. Consider a drop of cream in a cup of coffee as a fluid element. As the coffee is stirred, the drop distorts into a filament and finally disperses all over the cup, losing its identity. A fluid element at a fixed spot in the cup, however, retains its identity although particles continually go in and out of it.\nTo make the transformation to variables in a fixed frame, consider \\(\\mathbf{G}(x,t)\\) to be any property of a fluid in one-dimensional x space. The change of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) with time in a frame moving with the fluid is the sum of two terms: \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{G}(x,t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{G}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{G}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{G}}{\\partial t} + u_x\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{G}}{\\partial x}\n\\]\nThe first term on the right represents the change of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) at a fixed point in space, and the second term represents the change of G as the observer moves with the fluid into a region in which \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is different. In three dimensions, this generalizes to \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{G}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{G}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{G}\n\\]\nThis is called the convective derivative (Equation 3.2).\nIn the case of a plasma, we take \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) to be the fluid velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and write Equation 8.7 as \\[\nmn\\Big[\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\Big] = qn(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\partial\\mathbf{u}/\\partial t\\) is the time derivative in a fixed frame.\nStress Tensor –&gt; scalar pressure\n\\[\nmn\\Big[\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\Big] = qn(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla p\n\\tag{8.8}\\]\nWhat we have shown here is only a special case: the transfer of \\(x\\) momentum by motion in the \\(x\\) direction; and we have assumed that the fluid is isotropic, so that the same result holds in the y and z directions. But it is also possible to transfer \\(y\\) momentum by motion in the \\(x\\) direction, for instance. This shear stress cannot be represented by a scalar \\(p\\) but must be given by a tensor \\(\\mathbf{P}\\), the stress tensor, whose components \\(P_{ij}= mn\\overline{v_i v_j}\\) specify both the direction of motion and the component of momentum involved. In the general case the term \\(\\nabla p\\) is replaced by \\(-\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P}\\).\nWhen the distribution function is an isotropic Maxwellian, \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is written \\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix}p & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & p\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\(-\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P} = \\nabla p\\). A plasma could have two temperatures \\(T_\\perp\\) and \\(T_\\parallel\\) in the presence of a magnetic field. In that case, there would be two pressures \\(T_\\perp\\) and \\(T_\\parallel\\) in the presence of a magnetic field. In that case, there would be two pressure \\(p_\\perp = nk_B T_\\perp\\) and \\(p_\\parallel = nk_B T_\\parallel\\). The stress tensor is then \\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix}p_\\perp & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & p_\\perp & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & p_\\parallel\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere the coordinate of the third row or column is the direction of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). This is still diagonal and shows isotropy in a plane perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\nIn an ordinary fluid, the off-diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) are usually associated with viscosity. When particles make collisions, they come off with an average velocity in the direction of the fluid velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) at the point where they made their last collision. This momentum is transferred to another fluid element upon the next collision. This tends to equalize \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) at different points, and the resulting resistance to shear flow is what we intuitively think of as viscosity. The longer the mean free path, the farther momentum is carried, and the larger is the viscosity. In a plasma there is a similar effect which occurs even in the absence of collisions. The Larmor gyration of particles (particularly ions) brings them into different parts of the plasma and tends to equalize the fluid velocities there. The Larmor radius rather than the mean free path sets the scale of this kind of collisionless viscosity. It is a finite-Larmor-radius effect which occurs in addition to collisional viscosity and is closely related to the \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) drift in a nonuniform \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field (Equation 7.11).\n\n8.3.2.1 Collisions\nIf there is a neutral gas, the charged fluid will exchange momentum with it through collisions. The momentum lost per collision will be proportional to the relative velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{u}_0\\), where \\(\\mathbf{u}_0\\) is the velocity of the neutral fluid. If \\(\\tau\\), the mean free time between collisions, is approximately constant, the resulting force term can be roughly written as \\(-mn(\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{u}_0)/\\tau\\). The equation of motion can be generalized to include anisotropic pressure and neutral collisions as follows: \\[\nmn\\Big[\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\Big] = qn(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P} - \\frac{mn(\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{u}_0)}{\\tau}\n\\tag{8.9}\\]\nThis can also be written as (including the pressure term and other forces) \\[\n\\rho\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=(\\rho^\\ast \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B})-\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}+\\mathbf{f}_n\n\\]\nor, in an equivalent conservative form, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho\\mathbf{u})}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u})=(\\rho^\\ast \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B})-\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}+\\mathbf{f}_n\n\\]\nCollisions between charged particles have not been included; these will be discussed in sec-collision ADD IT!.\n\n\n8.3.2.2 Comparison with Ordinary Hydrodynamics\nOrdinary fluids obey the Navier–Stokes equation\n\\[\n\\rho\\Big[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u} \\Big] = -\\nabla p + \\rho\\nu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u}\n\\tag{8.10}\\]\nThis is the same as Equation 8.9 except for the absence of electromagnetic forces and collisions between species (there being only one species). The viscosity term \\(\\rho\\nu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u}\\), where \\(\\nu\\) is the kinematic viscosity coefficient, is just the collisional part of \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P} - \\nabla p\\) in the absence of magnetic fields. Equation 8.10 describes a fluid in which there are frequent collisions between particles. Equation 8.9, on the other hand, was derived without any explicit statement of the collision rate. Since the two equations are identical except for the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) terms, can Equation 8.9 really describe a plasma species? The answer is a guarded yes, and the reasons for this will tell us the limitations of the fluid theory. This is extremely important to clarify — there are still quite many people think that collision is assumed for the fluid theory, therefore do not believe that MHD can be used to describe plasmas.\nIn the derivation of Equation 8.9, we did actually assume implicitly that there were many collisions. This assumption came in the derivation of the pressure tensor (Section 12.4) when we took the velocity distribution to be Maxwellian. Such a distribution generally comes about as the result of frequent collisions. However, this assumption was used only to take the average of \\(v^2\\). Any other distribution with the same average would give us the same answer. The fluid theory, therefore, is not very sensitive to deviations from the Maxwellian distribution, but there are instances in which these deviations are important. Kinetic theory must then be used.\nThere is also an empirical observation by Irving Langmuir which helps the fluid theory. In working with the electrostatic probes which bear his name, Langmuir discovered that the electron distribution function was far more nearly Maxwellian than could be accounted for by the collision rate. This phenomenon, called Langmuir’s paradox, has been attributed at times to high-frequency oscillations. There has been no satisfactory resolution of the paradox, but this seems to be one of the few instances in plasma physics where nature works in our favor.\nAnother reason the fluid model works for plasmas is that the magnetic field, when there is one, can play the role of collisions in a certain sense. When a particle is accelerated, say by an \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field, it would continuously increase in velocity if it were allowed to free-stream. When there are frequent collisions, the particle comes to a limiting velocity proportional to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). The electrons in a copper wire, for instance, drift together with a velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\mu\\mathbf{E}\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the mobility. A magnetic field also limits free-streaming by forcing particles to gyrate in Larmor orbits. The electrons in a plasma also drift together with a velocity proportional to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), namely, \\(\\mathbf{v}_E=\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}/B^2\\). In this sense, a collisionless plasma behaves like a collisional fluid. Of course, particles do free-stream along the magnetic field, and the fluid picture is not particularly suitable for motions in that direction. For motions perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), the fluid theory is a good approximation.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Equation of State\nOne more relation is needed to close the system of equations. A complete description requires the equation of energy. However, the simplest way is to use the thermodynamic equation of state relating \\(p\\) to \\(n\\): \\[\np = C\\rho^\\gamma\n\\tag{8.11}\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is a constant and \\(\\gamma\\) is the ratio of specific heats \\(C_p/C_\\nu\\). The term \\(\\nabla p\\) is therefore given by \\[\n\\frac{\\nabla p}{p} = \\gamma \\frac{\\nabla n}{n}\n\\tag{8.12}\\]\nFor isothermal compression, we have \\[\n\\nabla p = \\nabla(nk_B T) = k_B T\\nabla n\n\\]\nso that, clearly, \\(\\gamma=1\\). For adiabatic compression, \\(k_B T\\) will also change, giving \\(\\gamma\\) a value larger than one. If \\(N\\) is the number of degrees of freedom, \\(\\gamma\\) is given by \\[\n\\gamma = (2+N)/N\n\\]\nThe validity of the equation of state requires that heat flow be negligible; that is, that thermal conductivity be low. Again, this is more likely to be true in directions perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) than parallel to it. Fortunately, most basic phenomena can be described adequately by the crude assumption of the equation of state.",

    "section": "8.4 Two-Fluid Model",
    "text": "8.4 Two-Fluid Model\nBesides the Vlasov theory (Chapter 12), we can apply the simpler but equally powerful 2-fluid model, in which electrons and ions are treated as two different fluids. Depending on the form of the pressure term, we have the 5/6/10-moment equations.\n\n8.4.1 Five-moment\nFive-moment refers to \\((\\rho, \\mathbf{u}, p)\\). Under either adiabatic or isothermal assumptions, we can get rid of the pressure/energy equation and replace it with an equation of state. For simplicity, let the plasma have only two species: ions and electrons; extension to more species is trivial. The charge and current densities are then given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma &= n_i q_i + n_e q_e \\\\\n\\mathbf{J} &= n_i q_i \\mathbf{v}_i + n_e q_e \\mathbf{v}_e\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe shall neglect collisions and viscosity. The complete equation set is: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon_0\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = n_i q_i + n_e q_e \\\\\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = -\\dot{\\mathbf{B}} \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = 0 \\\\\n\\mu_0^{-1}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = n_i q_i \\mathbf{u}_i + n_e q_e \\mathbf{u}_e + \\epsilon_0\\dot{\\mathbf{E}} \\\\\nm_jn_j\\Big[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}_j}{\\partial t}+(\\mathbf{u}_j\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_j\\Big] = q_j n_j (\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}_j\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla p_j\\quad j=i,e \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial n_j}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(n_j\\mathbf{u}_j) = 0\\quad j=i,e \\\\\np_j = C_j n_j^\\gamma\\quad j=i,e\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.13}\\] where \\(C_j\\) is a constant and \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index with the approximations in Table 8.1.\n\n\n\nTable 8.1: Equation of state approximations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime\nEquation of state\nName\n\n\n\n\n\\(v_\\mathrm{ph} \\gg v_{ts}\\)\n\\(p_s\\sim n_s^\\gamma\\)\nadiabatic\n\n\n\\(v_\\mathrm{ph} \\ll v_{ts}\\)\n\\(p_s=n_s k_B T_s\\), \\(T_s=\\mathrm{const.}\\)\nisothermal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 16 scalar unknowns: \\(n_i, n_e, p_i, p_e, \\mathbf{u}_i, \\mathbf{u}_e, \\mathbf{E}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). There are apparently 18 scalar equations if we count each vector equation as three scalar equations. However, two of Maxwell’s equations are superfluous, since the two of the equations can be recovered from the divergences of the other two. The simultaneous solution of this set of 16 equations in 16 unknowns gives a self-consistent set of fields and motions in the fluid approximation.\n\n\n8.4.2 Six-moment\nFor monatomic gases, the six-moment equations for all charged fluids (indexed by \\(s\\)) can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_s\\mathbf{u}_s) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho_s\\mathbf{u}_s)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[ \\rho_s\\mathbf{u}_s\\mathbf{u}_s + p_{s\\perp}\\pmb{I} + (p_{s\\parallel} - p_{s\\perp})\\hat{b}\\hat{b} \\right] = \\frac{q_s}{m_s}\\rho_s(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_s\\times\\mathbf{B}) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial p_{s\\parallel}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(p_{s\\parallel}\\mathbf{u}_s) = -2p_{s\\parallel}\\hat{b}\\cdot(\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_s \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial p_{s\\perp}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(p_{s\\perp}\\mathbf{u}_s) = -p_{s\\perp}(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s) + p_{s\\perp}\\hat{b}\\cdot(\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.14}\\]\nThe two pressure equations in Equation 8.14 can be combined to give the equation for the average pressure \\(p=(2p_\\perp + p_\\parallel)/3\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\partial p_s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(p_s\\mathbf{u}_s) = (p_s - p_{s\\parallel})\\hat{b}\\cdot(\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_s - \\left( p_s - \\frac{p_{s\\parallel}}{3} \\right)\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s\n\\tag{8.15}\\]\nAlternatively, we can solve for the hydrodynamic energy density \\(e = \\frac{n\\mathbf{u}^2}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}p\\) for each species: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial e_s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[ \\mathbf{u}_s(e_s+p_s) + \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot(p_{s\\parallel} - p_{s\\perp})\\hat{b}\\hat{b} \\right] = \\frac{q_s}{m_s}\\rho_s \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nwhich is more of a conservative form and can be beneficial to get better jump conditions across shock waves. Note, however, that the parallel pressure equation is still solved with the adiabatic assumption, so non-adiabatic heating is not properly captured. In addition, the magnetic energy is not included into the energy density, so the jump conditions are only approximate (I think this is more of a numerical consideration). In general, there can be many more source terms on the right hand sides of the above equations corresponding to gravity, charge exchange, chemical reactions, collisions, etc.\nThe electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are obtained from Maxwell’s equations: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} - c^2\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} &= -c^2\\mu_0\\mathbf{J} \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{\\rho_c}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\rho_c = \\sum_s (q_s/m_s)\\rho_s\\) is the total charge density and \\(\\mathbf{J}=\\sum_s(q_s/m_s)\\rho_s\\mathbf{u}_s\\) is the current density.\nThe last two equations are constraints on the initial conditions; these are not guaranteed to hold numerically. Classical tricks involves using hyperbolic/parabolic cleaning or a facially-collocated Yee-type mesh.\n\n\n8.4.3 Five/Ten-moment\n(Wang et al. 2020)\n\nContinuity equation for each species \\[\n\\frac{\\partial(m_s n_s)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial(m_sn_su_{j,s})}{\\partial x_j} = 0\n\\]\nMomentum equation for each species \\[\nn_s m_s\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} = n_s q_s(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_s - \\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\n\\] or in Einstein’s notation, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial(m_s n_s u_{i,s})}{\\partial t} = n_s q_s (E_i + \\epsilon_{ijk}u_{j,s}B_k) -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{P}_{ij,s}}{\\partial x_j} - R_{i,s\\alpha}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{ijk}\\) is the Levi-Civita symbol. The moments are defined as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_s(\\mathbf{x}) &\\equiv \\int f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} \\\\\nu_{i,s}(\\mathbf{x}) &\\equiv \\frac{1}{n_s(\\mathbf{x})}\\int v_i f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} \\\\\n\\mathcal{P}_{ij,s}(\\mathbf{x}) &\\equiv m_s \\int v_i v_j f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with \\(f_s(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v},t)\\) being the phase space distribution function. We will neglect the subscript \\(s\\) hereinafter for convenience. For completeness, \\(\\mathcal{P}_{ij}\\) relates to the more familiar thermal pressure tensor \\[\nP_{ij} \\equiv m\\int(v_i - u_i)(v_i - u_i)f\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\] by \\[\n\\mathcal{P}_{ij} = P_{ij} + nm u_i u_j\n\\]\n\nFor simplicity, non-ideal effects like viscous dissipation are neglected. The electric and magnetic fields \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are evolved using Maxwell equations \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} - c^2\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\sum_s q_s n_s \\mathbf{u}_s \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = 0 \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\epsilon_0^{-1}\\sum_s n_s q_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with \\(c=1/\\sqrt(\\mu_0\\epsilon_0)\\) being the speed of light.\nTo close the system, the second order moment \\(\\mathcal{P}_{ij}\\) or \\(P_{ij}\\) must be specified. For example, a cold fluid closure simply sets \\(P_{ij}=0\\), while an isothermal equation of state (EOS) assumes that the temperature is constant. Or, assuming zero heat flux and that the pressure tensor is isotropic, we can write an adiabatic EOS for \\(P_{ij} = p I_{ij}\\), \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{\\epsilon}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[ (p+\\mathcal{\\epsilon})\\mathbf{u} \\right] = nq\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\n\\] where \\[\n\\mathcal{\\epsilon} \\equiv \\frac{p}{\\gamma-1} + \\frac{1}{2}mn\\mathbf{u}^2\n\\] is the total fluid (thermal + kinetic) energy and \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index, setting to \\(5/3\\) for a fully ionized plasma. For a plasma with \\(S\\) species (\\(s=1,...,S\\)) this system is closed and has a total of \\(5S+6\\) equations, and are here referred to as the five-moment model. More general models can be obtained by retaining the evolution equations for all six components of the pressure tensor in the so-called ten-moment model \\[\n\\frac{\\mathcal{P}_{ij,s}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{Q}_{ijm,s}}{\\partial x_m} = n_sq_su_{i,s}E_j + \\frac{q_s}{m_s}\\epsilon_{iml}\\mathcal{P}_{mj,s}B_l\n\\tag{8.16}\\] where the third moment \\[\n\\mathcal{Q}_{ijm,s}(\\mathbf{x}) \\equiv m_s\\int v_i v_j v_m f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\] relates to the heat flux tensor defined in the fluid frame \\[\nQ_{ijm} \\equiv m\\int (v_i-u_i)(v_j-u_j)(v_m-u_m)\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\] by \\[\n\\mathcal{Q}_{ijm} = Q_{ijm} + u_i\\mathcal{P}_{jm} - 2nm u_i u_j u_m\n\\]\nAgain, the equations here must be closed by some approximation for the heat-flux tensor. Another option is to include evolution equations for even higher order moments, e.g., the ten independent components of the heat-flux tensor.\nTheoretically, the multifluid-Maxwell equations approach the Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) under asymptotic limits of vanishing electron mass (\\(m_e \\rightarrow 0\\)) and infinite speed of light (\\(c\\rightarrow\\infty\\)). All waves and effects within the two-fluid picture are retained, for example, the light wave, electron and ion inertial effects like the ion cyclotron wave and whistler wave. Particularly, through properly devised heat-flux closures, the ten-moment model could partially capture nonlocal kinetic effects like Landau damping, in a manner similar to the gyrokinetic models.\nAlthough multifluid-Maxwell models provide a more complete description of the plasma than reduced, asymptotic models like MHD, they are less frequently used. The reason for this is the fast kinetic scales involved. Retaining the electron inertia adds plasma-frequency and cyclotron time-scale, while non-neutrality adds Debye length spatial-scales. Further, inclusion of the displacement currents means that EM waves must be resolved when using an explicit scheme. Fortunately, the restrictions due to kinetic scales are introduced only through the non-hyperbolic source terms of the momentum equation, the Ampère’s law, and the pressure equation. Therefore we may eliminate these restrictions by updating the source term separately either exactly or using an implicit algorithm (Note: BATSRUS applies the point-implicit scheme.). This allows larger time steps and leads to significant speedup, especially with realistic electron/ion mass ratios. The speed of light constraint still exists, however, can be greatly relaxed, using reduced values for the speed of light and/or sub-cycling Maxwell equations. Of course, an implicit Maxwell solver, or a reduced set of electromagnetic equations like the Darwin approximation1, can also relax the time-step restrictions.\n\n\n8.4.4 Characteristic wave speeds\nThe fastest wave speed in the 5/6/10-moment equations is the speed of light \\(c\\). Theoretically, the characteristic wave speeds shall be consistent and fallback to MHD in the isotropic 5-moment case.\nNumerically, however, using \\(c\\) in the numerical fluxes makes the scheme rather diffusive (?). The discretization time step is limited by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition based on the speed of light. In practice, we can reduce the speed of light to a value that is a factor of 2-3 faster than the fastest flow and fast wave speed to speed up the simulation.",

Landau once pointed out that the validity of describing plasma behaviors with two-fluid equations is based on the fact that the time scale of ions and electrons to reach an equilibrium Maxwellian distribution is much smaller than that of the heat exchange between species. The Ohm’s law is established upon the collisions between electrons, ions and neutral species, and is used to describe the relation between \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E},\\,\\mathbf{B},\\,\\mathbf{u}\\).\n\n8.5.1 Basic definitions and assumptions\nAssume plasma consists of electrons and ionized \\(\\textrm{H}^+\\). We use \\(e,\\, i,\\, a\\) as subscripts for electron, ion and neutral species respectively. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_e=-q_i=-e \\\\\nm_e\\ll m_i \\approx m_a\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWith the definition of ionization degree in Equation 2.1, \\[\n\\alpha=\\frac{n_i}{n_i+n_a}\n\\tag{8.17}\\] we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{n_i}{n_a}&=\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n\\frac{n_i}{2n_i+n_a}&=\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}\\\\\n\\frac{n_a}{2n_i+n_a}&=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe quasi-neutrality assumption gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_e^\\ast+\\rho_i^\\ast =0\\ \\Rightarrow\\ n_e=n_i \\\\\n\\rho_e=m_e n_e \\ll \\rho_i=m_i n_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAssume a system of ideal gas in thermal equilibrium, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_e=T_i=T_a \\\\\np=p_e+p_i+p_a\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUsing the ionization degree defined in Equation 8.17, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np_e = p_i = \\frac{n_i}{2n_i+n_a} p = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha} p \\\\\np_a = \\frac{n_a}{2n_i+n_a}p = \\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}p\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Also, we have \\[\nv_{e,th}\\gg v_{i,th}\n\\]\nAssume that the flow velocity is much smaller than the thermal speed, \\[\n|\\mathbf{v}_s|\\ll |\\mathbf{v}_{s,th}|,\\quad s=e,\\, i,\\, a.\n\\]\nTypical time scale must satisfy \\(\\tau_0\\gg \\tau_{\\text{collision}}\\).\nFinally, we ignore viscosity and non-EM force in the derivation.\nThe average velocity of protons with respect to bulk velocity of the plasma, the velocity difference between electron and ion, and the average velocity of neutral particles are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{v}_i&=\\mathbf{u}_i-\\mathbf{u} \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{ei}&=\\mathbf{u}_e-\\mathbf{u}_i \\\\\n\\mathbf{u}_a&=\\mathbf{u}-\\frac{n_i}{n_a}\\left(\\mathbf{v}_i+\\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe average momenta of electrons relative to protons and neutral particles are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{I}_{ei}&=m_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei} \\\\\n\\mathbf{I}_{ea}&=m_e\\left[\\left( 1+\\frac{n_im_e}{n_a m_i}\\right)\\mathbf{v}_{ei}+\\left( 1+\\frac{n_i}{n_a}\\right)\\mathbf{v}_i\\right]\\approx m_e\\left[ \\mathbf{v}_{ei}+\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\right)\\mathbf{v}_i \\right] \\\\\n\\mathbf{I}_{ia}&=m_i(\\mathbf{u}_i-\\mathbf{u}_a)=m_i (\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{u}_a)=\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}m_i\\mathbf{v}_i+\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}m_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that from Newton’s third law, \\(\\Delta \\mathbf{I}_{sk}=-\\Delta \\mathbf{I}_{ks}\\).\n\n\n8.5.2 Equation of motion for each species\n\n8.5.2.1 For electrons\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_en_e\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_e}{dt}&=m_en_i\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\mathbf{v}_{ei}+\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u}\\right) \\\\\n&=-\\nabla p_e - n_i e \\left[ \\mathbf{E}+(\\mathbf{v}_{ei}+\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u})\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right]+\\mathbf{f}_e^c\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.18}\\] where the collisional force \\[\n\\mathbf{f}_e^c=-n_i m_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\left(\\tau_{ei}^{-1}+\\tau_{ea}^{-1}\\right)-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}n_i m_e\\mathbf{v}_i\\tau_{ea}^{-1}\n\\tag{8.19}\\]\nProof:\n\\(\\mathbf{f}_{sk}^c\\cdot\\tau_{sk}=n_s\\Delta \\mathbf{I}_{sk}\\), where \\(\\tau_{sk}\\) is the average collision interval. \\[\n\\Delta \\mathbf{I}_{sk}=-\\Delta \\mathbf{I}_{ks}\n\\]\nAssuming elastic collision, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta\\mathbf{I}_{sk}&=-\\frac{m_sm_k}{m_s+m_k}\\mathbf{v}_{sk} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\Delta\\mathbf{I}_{ek}&=-\\frac{m_k}{m_e+m_k}m_e\\mathbf{v}_{ek}\\approx -\\mathbf{I}_{ek}\\text{(ignore electron mass)}\\\\\n\\Delta\\mathbf{I}_{ia}&=-\\frac{m_a}{m_a+m_i}m_i\\mathbf{v}_{ia}\\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{I}_{ia}\\text{(ion mass=neutron mass)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore the collision force of electron is \\[\n\\mathbf{f}_e^c=-n_i\\mathbf{I}_{ei}\\tau_{ei}^{-1}-n_i\\mathbf{I}_{ea}\\tau_{ea}^{-1}=-n_i m_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\left(\\tau_{ei}^{-1}+\\tau_{ea}^{-1}\\right)-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}n_i m_e\\mathbf{v}_i\\tau_{ea}^{-1}\n\\] The collision force between ion and neutral is \\[\n\\mathbf{f}_{ia}^c=-\\frac{1}{2}n_i\\mathbf{I}_{ia}\\tau_{ia}^{-1}\n\\] □\n\n\n8.5.2.2 For protons\n\\[\nm_i n_i\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_i}{dt}=m_i n_i\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u})=-\\nabla p_i+n_i e\\left[ \\mathbf{E}+\\left(\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right) \\right]+\\mathbf{f}_i^c\n\\tag{8.20}\\] where the collision force is \\[\n\\mathbf{f}_{i}^c=\\mathbf{f}_{ia}^c+\\mathbf{f}_{ie}^c=n_im_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\tau_{ei}^{-1}-\\frac{\\alpha}{2(1-\\alpha)}n_im_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\tau_{ia}^{-1}-\\frac{1}{2(1-\\alpha)}n_i m_i\\mathbf{v}_i\\tau_{ia}^{-1}\n\\tag{8.21}\\]\n\n\n8.5.2.3 For the whole plasma\nIf we do not consider the effect of other forces on plasma and ignore electron mass (\\(m_en_e\\ll m_in_i\\)), \\[\nm_i(n_i+n_a)\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=-\\nabla p+\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}=-\\nabla p-n_i e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{8.22}\\] where the total current density is \\[\n\\mathbf{J}=\\sum_s{n_s q_s\\mathbf{u}_s}=-n_i e(\\mathbf{v}_{ei}+\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u})+n_i e(\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u})=-n_i e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\n\\] Physically we usually think of current in plasma as the velocity difference between electrons and ions.\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Preconditions\nIf an external B-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the Lorentz force on the charge carriers: \\[\n\\mathbf{J}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the electric conductivity.\nIn the rest frame of the moving conductor this term drops out because \\(\\mathbf{u}=0\\). There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the E-field in the lab frame: \\(\\mathbf{E}^\\prime = \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\). Electric and magnetic fields are relative and related by the Lorentz transformation.\nIf the current \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) is alternating because the applied voltage or E-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance (see electrical impedance). The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled. (hyzhou: This is related to the Ponderamotive force. I have some questions here because the time derivative of velocities are all neglected here, which in turn makes the derivation only applicable to a steady system. The obvious problem then is that the generalized Ohm’s law may not hold in a time-dependent system!)\n\n\n8.5.4 Derivation\nNegligible terms:\n\n\\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_e}{dt}\\) in Equation 8.18 and \\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_i}{dt}\\) in Equation 8.20, because \\(|\\mathbf{v}|\\ll |\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{th}|\\)\n\\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}\\) in Equation 8.18. From Equation 8.22 and \\(m_e \\ll m_i\\), \\[\nm_en_i\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=\\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\frac{n_i}{n_i+n_a}\\left(-\\nabla p-n_i e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)\\ll 1\n\\]\n\nFrom Equation 8.18, \\[\nm_e n_i\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=-\\nabla p_e -n_i e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\times\\mathbf{B}-n_ie [\\mathbf{E}+(\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u})\\times\\mathbf{B}]+\\mathbf{f}_e^c\n\\]\nThe above two equations give \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0=&-\\nabla p_e -n_i e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\times\\mathbf{B}-n_ie [\\mathbf{E}+(\\mathbf{v}_i+\\mathbf{u})\\times\\mathbf{B}] \\\\\n& -n_i m_e\\mathbf{v}_{ei}\\left(\\tau_{ei}^{-1}+\\tau_{ea}^{-1}\\right)-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}n_i m_e\\mathbf{v}_i\\tau_{ea}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.23}\\]\nEquation 8.20, Equation 8.22 and Equation 8.23 are the three main equations we need to derive the generalized Ohm’s law.\nIf we define the ratios of gyro-period and collision time as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\kappa_{ei} &\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\Omega_e \\tau_{ei}}=\\frac{m_e}{eB}\\tau_{ei}^{-1} \\\\\n\\kappa_{ea} &\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\Omega_e \\tau_{ea}}=\\frac{m_e}{eB}\\tau_{ea}^{-1} \\\\\n\\kappa_{ia}&\\equiv \\frac{1}{2\\Omega_i \\tau_{ia}}=\\frac{m_i}{2eB}\\tau_{ia}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and ion current density as \\[\n\\mathbf{J}_i=n_i e\\mathbf{v}_i\n\\] we can write the three main equations above as \\[\n0=-\\nabla p_e -n_i e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) + \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{J}_i\\times\\mathbf{B}+(\\kappa_{ei}+\\kappa_{ea})B\\mathbf{J}-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\kappa_{ea}B\\mathbf{J}_i\n\\tag{8.24}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_in_i\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=&-\\nabla p_i+n_i e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})+\\mathbf{J}_i\\times\\mathbf{B} \\\\ &-(\\kappa_{ei}-\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\kappa_{ia})B\\mathbf{J}-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\kappa_{ia}B\\mathbf{J}_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.25}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha}m_i n_i\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=-\\nabla p+\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{8.26}\\]\nSubtracting Equation 8.25 from Equation 8.26 and Equation 8.24, we get the ion current density as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{J}_i&=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{(\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia})B}\\left[ \\alpha\\nabla p -\\nabla(p_e+p_i)+(1-\\alpha)\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}+(\\kappa_{ea}+\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\kappa_{ia})B\\mathbf{J}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{(\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia})B}\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{\\alpha+1}\\nabla p+(1-\\alpha)\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}+(\\kappa_{ea}+\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\kappa_{ia})B\\mathbf{J}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen we can eliminate \\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{J}_i\\) from the three main equations and get the generalized Ohm’s law \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla p_e +\\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{\\alpha+1}r_e \\nabla p=&-n_i e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n+\\left[1-2r_e(1-\\alpha)-\\alpha\\frac{m_e}{m_i}r_i\\right]\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n&+\\left[\\kappa_{ei}-(1-r_e)\\kappa-\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\frac{m_e}{m_i}r_e\\kappa_{ia}\\right]B\\mathbf{J} \\\\\n&+\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^2}{(\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia})B}\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+1}\\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\[\nr_e=\\frac{\\kappa_{ea}}{\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia}},\\quad r_i=\\frac{\\kappa_{ia}}{\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia}}\n\\]\n\n\n8.5.5 Simplification of Generalized Ohm’s Law\n\nIf the mean free path of protons is much smaller than that of electrons, i.e. the cross section of proton is much smaller than that of electron, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\frac{\\tau_{ia}}{\\tau_{ea}}=\\frac{l_{ia}\\cdot v_{e,th}}{l_{ea}\\cdot v_{i,th}}\\propto \\Big(\\frac{m_i}{m_e}\\Big)^{1/2}\\cdot\\frac{l_{ia}}{l_ea}\\ll  \\Big(\\frac{m_i}{m_e}\\Big)^{1/2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &\\frac{\\kappa_{ea}}{\\kappa_{ia}}=2\\frac{\\Omega_i \\tau_{ia}}{\\Omega_e\\tau_{ea}}\\propto 2\\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\cdot\\frac{\\tau_{ia}}{\\tau_{ea}}\\propto2\\Big( \\frac{m_e}{m_i}\\Big)^{1/2}\\cdot\\frac{l_{ia}}{l_{ea}}\\ll 1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &r_e=\\frac{\\kappa_{ea}}{\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia}}\\ll1\\quad\nr_i=\\frac{\\kappa_{ia}}{\\kappa_{ea}+\\kappa_{ia}}\\approx 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nTherefore we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla p_e=&-n_i e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})+\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}+(\\kappa_{ei}+\\kappa_{ea})B\\mathbf{J}+\n\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^2}{\\kappa_{ia}B}\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+1}\\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right] \\\\\n\\mathbf{J}=&\\frac{n_i e}{(\\kappa_{ei}+\\kappa_{ea})B}\\left(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)+\n\\frac{1}{(\\kappa_{ei}+\\kappa_{ea})B}\\left( \\nabla p_e-\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right) \\\\\n&-\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^2}{\\kappa_{ia}(\\kappa_{ei}+\\kappa_{ea})B}\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+1}\\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nIf EM field is dominant, i.e. EM force \\(\\gg\\) thermal pressure gradient, \\(|\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}|\\gg |\\nabla p|\\sim |\\nabla p_e|\\), then \\[\n\\mathbf{J}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})-\\frac{\\sigma}{n_i e}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}+\n\\frac{\\sigma}{n_i e}\\frac{2(1-\\alpha)^2 \\Omega_i\\tau_{ia}}{B}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the electrical conductivity, \\[\n\\sigma=\\frac{n_i e^2}{m_e(\\tau_{ei}^{-1}+\\tau_{ea}^{-1})}\n\\]\nFor a fully ionized plasma, \\(\\alpha=1\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\kappa_{ea}=\\kappa_{ia}=0\\), we have \\[\n\\mathbf{J}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})+\\frac{\\sigma}{n_i e}\\left(\\nabla p_e -\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)\n\\] where \\[\n\\sigma=\\frac{n_i e^2\\tau_{ei}}{m_e}\n\\]\n\nNote that the electron pressure gradient term here shows an amazing effect: it can generate EM field out of nothing! This is one theory in astrophysics which describes the origin of EM field.\n\nFor a fully ionized plasma, if EM field is dominant, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{J}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) -\\frac{\\sigma}{n_i e}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}=\n\\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) -\\Omega_e \\tau_{ei}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{b}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf there is weak magnetic field and dense plasma, i.e. \\(n_i \\gg 1,\\ |\\mathbf{B}|\\ll 1\\), \\[\n\\mathbf{J}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\n\n\n\n8.5.6 Discussions\nIn Section 8.6.1, we will see that a relatively simple form can be obtained by assuming that the electron inertia is much smaller than the Lorentz force, which is a good approximation when considering only the perpendicular velocity to the magnetic field.\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B} + \\eta\\mathbf{J} + \\frac{1}{en}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\frac{1}{en}\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e +\\frac{m_e}{ne^2}\\Big[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{J}) \\Big]\n\\tag{8.27}\\]\nwhere the first term on the right-hand side is the convection term, the second term is the resistivity term (conductive term), the third term is called the Hall term, the fourth term is the electron pressure term, and the fifth term is called the electron inertia term, since it is proportional to the mass of electrons.\nNote that both \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) are the first-order moments, with \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) being the (weighted) sum of the first-order moment of electrons and ions while \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) being the difference between them. The generalized Ohm’s law is actually the difference between the electrons’ and ions’ first-order moment equations. The generalized Ohm’s law is an equation that governs the time evolution of \\(\\mathbf{J}\\). Also note that Ampère’s law, with the displacement current retained, is an equation governing the time evolution of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). However, in the approximation of the resistive MHD, the time derivative terms \\(\\partial \\mathbf{E}/\\partial t\\) and \\(\\partial \\mathbf{J} /\\partial t\\) are ignored in Ampère’s law and Ohm’s law, respectively. In this approximation, Ohm’s law is directly solved to determine \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and Ampère’s law is directly solved to determine \\(\\mathbf{J}\\). [Introduction to plasma physics: with space and laboratory applications, D. A. Gurnett and A. Bhattacharjee.]\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E}}_{a} + \\underbrace{\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}}_{b} - \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\mathbf{J}}_{c} - \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{en_e}}_{d} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{n_e e}\\nabla(n_e k_B T_e)}_{e} = 0\n\\]\nDenote each term above with a to e. From the single-fluid MHD momentum equation, let \\(\\omega\\) be the oscillation frequency of the perturbed velocity, and variable in scalar form be the characteristic magnitude of that quantity, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho\\big( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u}\\big) = \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\nabla p +\\rho\\mathbf{g} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\omega\\rho U\\sim J B\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.28}\\]\nUsing and the assumptions of MHD, the relations between each term in generalized Ohm’s law are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{b}{d} &= \\frac{UB}{JB/en_e} = \\frac{en_eUB}{\\omega \\rho U} = \\frac{en_e B}{\\omega n_e m_i} = \\frac{\\Omega_i}{\\omega} \\gg 1 \\\\\n\\frac{c}{d} &= \\frac{J/\\sigma}{JB/en_e} = \\frac{en_e}{B\\sigma} = \\frac{en_e}{Be^2 n_e/\\nu_{ei} m_e} = \\frac{\\nu_{ei}}{\\Omega_e} \\ll 1 \\\\\n\\frac{b}{d} &= \\frac{U}{J/en_e} \\ll 1,\\ \\text{if } \\mathbf{J} \\text{ is carried by } \\mathbf{u}_e\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which generates direct contradiction with the MHD assumption that \\(\\mathbf{u}\\ll \\mathbf{u}_e\\) if currents are mostly carried by electrons. (WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURE TERM SCALING? The gradient implies that it is related to the system size; the pressure implies that it is also related to thermal motion?)\nThere is an interesting point about the electron pressure term. If we assume an isotropic plasma with \\(n_i=n_e\\) and an adiabatic process \\(P/n^\\gamma=C\\) where \\(C\\) is a constant and \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\nabla P_e} &= \\frac{\\nabla P_e}{n} = \\frac{\\nabla P_i}{n} = \\frac{\\nabla(Cn^\\gamma)}{n} \\\\\n&= C\\gamma n^{\\gamma-2}\\nabla n = C\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\nabla n^{\\gamma-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.29}\\]\nEquation 8.29 indicates that the associated electric field is a potential field that only relates to density.\n\n\n8.5.7 Ohm’s Law in a Multi-Ion System\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= -\\sum_i\\mathbf{u}_i\\times\\mathbf{B} + \\eta\\mathbf{J} + \\frac{1}{en_e}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\frac{1}{en_e}\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e \\\\\n&+\\frac{m_e}{n_e e^2}\\Big[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{J}) \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.30}\\]\nwhere the quasi-neutrality holds \\[\nen_e = \\sum_i q_i n_i\n\\]",

    "section": "8.6 Magnetohydrodynamics",
    "text": "8.6 Magnetohydrodynamics\nParticle motion in the two-fluid system was described by the individual species’ mean velocities \\(\\mathbf{u}_e, \\mathbf{u}_i\\) and by the pressures \\(\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e, \\overleftrightarrow{P}_i\\), which provide an accounting for the mean square of the random deviation of the velocity from its average value. Magnetohydrodynamics is an alternate description of the plasma where, instead of using \\(\\mathbf{u}_e,\\mathbf{u}_i\\) to describe mean motion, two new velocity variables that are a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_e,\\mathbf{u}_i\\) are used. As will be seen below, this means a slightly different definition for pressure must also be used.\nThe new velocity-like variables are\n\nthe current density \\[\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sum_s n_s q_s\\mathbf{u}_s\n\\] which is essentially the relative velocity between ions and electrons, and\nthe center-of-mass velocity \\[\n\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\sum_s m_s n_s \\mathbf{u}_s\n\\] where \\[\n\\rho = \\sum_s m_s n_s\n\\] is the total mass density.\n\nMagnetohydrodynamics is primarily concerned with low-frequency, long-wavelength, magnetic behavior of the plasma. There are three basic assumptions in MHD: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon\\omega/4\\pi\\sigma& \\ll 1, \\\\\n(v/c)^2&\\ll 1,\\\\\n\\lambda/ L& \\ll 1,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\omega\\) is the plasma frequency, \\(v\\) is the plasma bulk speed, \\(\\lambda\\) is the average free distance, and \\(L\\) is the system characteristic length.\nStandard orderings of ideal MHD can also be written as \\[\n\\epsilon \\sim \\omega/\\Omega_c \\sim k\\rho\n\\] where the plasma varies on frequency scales \\(\\omega\\) small compared to the gyrofrequency \\(\\Omega_c\\), and varies on spatial scales \\(1/k\\) long compared to the gyroradius \\(\\rho\\). (Here, \\(\\epsilon\\) means a “small” value.) Thus it covers phenomenon related to compressional and shear Alfvén waves and instabilities, ion acoustic waves, and ion and electron kinetic effects such as Landau damping. However, it does not include drift-waves or other micro-instabilities because they result from finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects which vanish in the usual MHD ordering.\nSingle fluid MHD is somehow inconsistent since there is only one velocity. The definition of current using velocity cannot be applied, and the current can only be given by Ampère’s law (without the displacement current), \\(\\mathbf{J}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}/\\mu_0\\).\nMultiplying Equation 8.5 by \\(m_s\\) and summing over species gives the MHD continuity equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{u}) = 0\n\\tag{8.31}\\]\nTo obtain an MHD equation of motion we take the first moment of the Vlasov equation and multiply the single species momentum equation by \\(m_s\\) and sum over species, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\sum_s m_s \\int\\mathbf{v}f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\sum_s\\int m_s \\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} + \\sum_s q_s \\int\\mathbf{v}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot [(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})f_s] = 0\n\\tag{8.32}\\]\nThe right-hand side is zero since \\(\\mathbf{R}_{ei} + \\mathbf{R}_{ie}=0\\), i.e., the total plasma cannot exert drag on itself. We now define random velocities relative to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) (rather than to \\(\\mathbf{u}_s\\) as was the case for the two-fluid equations) so that the second term can be written as \\[\n\\sum_s\\int m_s \\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = \\sum_s\\int m_s (\\mathbf{v}^\\prime + \\mathbf{u})(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime + \\mathbf{u})f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = \\sum_s\\int m_s \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} + \\rho\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}\n\\tag{8.33}\\] where \\(\\sum_s\\int m_s \\mathbf{v}^\\prime f\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = 0\\) has been used to eliminate terms linear in \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\). The MHD pressure tensor is now defined in terms of the random velocities relative to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and is given by \\[\n\\overleftrightarrow{P}^{\\mathrm{MHD}} = \\sum_s \\int m_s \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\tag{8.34}\\]\nWe insert Equation 8.33 and Equation 8.34 in Equation 8.32, integrate by parts on the acceleration term, and perform the summation over species to obtain the MHD equation of motion \\[\n\\frac{\\partial(\\rho\\mathbf{u})}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}) = \\left( \\sum_s n_s q_s \\right)\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}^{\\mathrm{MHD}}\n\\tag{8.35}\\]\nMHD is typically used to describe phenomena having spatial scales large enough for the plasma to be essentially neutral, i.e., \\(\\sum_s n_s q_s = 0\\) so that the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) term can be dropped. Just as in the two-fluid situation, the left-hand side of Equation 8.35 contains a factor times the MHD continuity equation, since the left-hand side can be expanded as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial(\\rho\\mathbf{u})}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}) &= \\left[ \\cancel{\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{u})} \\right]\\mathbf{u} + \\rho\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\rho\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} \\\\\n&= \\rho \\left( \\rho\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\rho\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis leads to the standard form for the MHD equation of motion, \\[\n\\rho\\frac{\\mathrm{D}\\mathbf{u}}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}^{\\mathrm{MHD}}\n\\tag{8.36}\\] where \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}}{\\mathrm{D}t} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\n\\] is the convective derivative defined using the center-of-mass velocity. This notation is used to emphasize the difference from single species treatment. Scalar approximations of the MHD pressure tensor will be postponed until after discussing the MHD Ohm’s law and its implications.\n\n8.6.1 MHD Ohm’s law\nEquation 8.36 provides one equation relating \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}\\); let us now find the other one. In order to do this, consider the two-fluid electron equation of motion, \\[\nm_e\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_e}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}_e\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{1}{n_e}\\nabla(n_e k_B T_e) - \\nu_{ei}m_e(\\mathbf{u}_e - \\mathbf{u}_i)\n\\tag{8.37}\\]\nIn MHD we are interested in low-frequency phenomena with large spatial scales. If the characteristic time scale of the phenomenon is long compared to the electron cyclotron motion, then the electron inertia term \\(m_e \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_e/\\mathrm{d}t\\) can be dropped since it is small compared to the magnetic force term \\(-e(\\mathbf{u}_e\\times\\mathbf{B})\\). This assumption is reasonable for velocities perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), but can be a poor approximation for the velocity component parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), since parallel velocities do not provide a magnetic force. Since \\(\\mathbf{u}_e - \\mathbf{u}_i = -\\mathbf{J}/n_e e\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_i\\simeq \\mathbf{u}\\), Equation 8.37 reduces to the generalized Ohm’s law \\[\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{n_e e}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{n_e e}\\nabla(n_e k_B T_e) = \\eta\\mathbf{J}\n\\tag{8.38}\\]\n(What if we consider ion species with charge larger than 1?) The term \\(-\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}/n_e e\\) on the left-hand side is called the Hall term and can be neglected in either of the following two cases:\n\nThe pressure term in the MHD equation of motion, Equation 8.36 is negligible compared to the other two terms, which therefore must balance, giving \\[\n|\\mathbf{J}|\\sim \\omega\\rho|\\mathbf{u}|/|\\mathbf{B}|\n\\]\n\nHere \\(\\omega\\sim\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{D}t\\) is the characteristic frequency of the phenomenon. In this case comparison of the Hall term with the U×B term shows that the Hall term is small by a factor \\(\\sim \\omega/\\omega_{ci}\\), where \\(\\omega_{ci}=q_i B/m_i\\) is the ion cyclotron frequency. Thus dropping the Hall term is justified for phenomena having characteristic frequencies small compared to \\(\\omega_{ci}\\).\n\nThe electron-ion collision frequency is large compared to the electron cyclotron frequency \\(\\omega_{ce}=q_e B /m_e\\), in which case the Hall term may be dropped since it is small by a factor \\(\\omega_{ce}/\\nu_{ei}\\) compared to the right-hand side resistive term \\(\\eta\\mathbf{J}=(m_e\\nu_{ei}/n_e e^2)\\mathbf{J}\\).\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Ideal MHD\nIf the Hall term is dropped, the system is called ideal MHD. Typically, Equation 8.38 will not be used directly; instead its curl will be used to provide the induction equation \\[\n-\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{1}{n_e e}\\nabla n_e\\times\\nabla k_B T_e = \\nabla\\times\\left( \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right)\n\\]\nUsually the density gradient is parallel to the temperature gradient so that the thermal electromotive force term \\((n_e e)^{-1}\\nabla n_e\\times\\nabla k_B T_e\\) can be dropped, or the thermal term is often simply ignored, in which case the induction equation reduces to \\[\n-\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla\\times\\left( \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right)\n\\tag{8.39}\\] or written in the form of Ohm’s law \\[\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\eta\\mathbf{J}\n\\tag{8.40}\\]\nIf the resistive term \\(\\eta\\mathbf{J}\\) is so small as to be negligible compared to the other terms in Equation 8.40, then the plasma is said to be ideal or perfectly conducting. From the Lorentz transformation of electromagnetic theory we realize that \\[\n\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{E}^\\prime\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{E}^\\prime\\) is the electric field observed in the frame moving with velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). This implies that the magnetic flux in ideal plasmas is time-invariant in the frame moving with velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), because otherwise Faraday’s law would imply the existence of an electric field in the moving frame. The frozen-in flux concept is the essential “bed-rock” concept underlying ideal MHD. While this concept is often an excellent approximation, it must be kept in mind that the concept becomes invalid in situations when any one of the electron inertia, electron pressure, or Hall terms becomes important and leads to different, more complex behavior.\nThe frozen-in flux concept is frequently expressed in a slightly different form as a frozen-in field concept, i.e., it is often said that magnetic field lines are frozen into the plasma so that the plasma and magnetic field lines move together as an ensemble. While this point of view can be quite intuitive and useful, it contains some ambiguity because an ideal plasma can actually move across magnetic field lines in certain situations. These situations are such that magnetic flux is preserved within the plasma even though it is moving across field lines.\nA formal proof of the frozen-in flux property will now be established by direct calculation of the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a surface \\(S(t)\\) bounded by a material line \\(C(t)\\), i.e., a closed contour that moves with the plasma. This magnetic flux is \\[\n\\Phi(t) = \\int_{S(t)} \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}\n\\] and the flux changes with respect to time due to either (i) the explicit time dependence of \\(\\mathbf{B}(t)\\) or (ii) changes in the surface \\(S(t)\\) resulting from plasma motion. The rate of change of flux is thus \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\lim_{\\delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\left( \\frac{ \\int_{S(t+\\delta t)} \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x},t+\\delta t)\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} - \\int_{S(t)} \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} }{\\delta t} \\right)\n\\]\nThe displacement of a segment \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l}\\) of the bounding contour \\(C\\) is \\(\\mathbf{u}\\delta t\\), where \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the velocity of this segment. The incremental change in surface area due to this displacement is \\(\\Delta S = \\mathbf{u}\\delta t\\times\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l}\\). The rate of change of flux can thus be expressed as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{D}t} &= \\lim_{\\delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\left( \\frac{ \\int_{S(t+\\delta t)} \\left(\\mathbf{B}+\\delta t\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\right)\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} - \\int_{S(t)} \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} }{\\delta t} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{\\delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\left( \\frac{ \\int_{S(t)} \\left(\\mathbf{B}+\\delta t\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\right)\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} + \\oint_C\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}\\delta t\\times\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l} - \\int_{S(t)} \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} }{\\delta t} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\int_{S(t)}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} + \\oint_C\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l} \\\\\n&= \\int_{S(t)}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s} + \\oint_C\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l}\\cdot(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) \\\\\n&= \\int_{S(t)}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{u}) \\right]\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, if \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{u}) = 0\n\\tag{8.41}\\] then \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{D}t} = 0\n\\] so that the magnetic flux linked by any closed material line is constant. Therefore, magnetic flux is frozen into an ideal plasma because Equation 8.39 reduces to Equation 8.41 if \\(\\eta = 0\\). Equation 8.41 is called the ideal MHD induction equation.\n\n8.6.2.1 Equation of state\nDouble adiabatic laws\nA procedure analogous to that which led to Equation 8.11 or Equation 12.28 gives the MHD adiabatic relation \\[\n\\frac{p^{\\mathrm{MHD}}}{\\rho^\\gamma} = \\mathrm{const}.\n\\] where again \\(\\gamma=(N+2)/N\\) and \\(N\\) is the number of dimensions of the system. It was shown in the previous section that magnetic flux is conserved in the plasma frame. This means that, as shown in Figure 8.1, a tube of plasma initially occupying the same volume as a magnetic flux tube is constrained to evolve in such a way that \\(\\int\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}\\) stays constant over the plasma tube cross-section. For a flux tube of infinitesimal cross-section, the magnetic field is approximately uniform over the cross-section and we may write this as \\(BA = \\mathrm{const}\\), where \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Magnetic flux tube with flux \\(\\Phi=BA\\).\n\n\n\nLet us define two temperatures for this magnetized plasma, namely \\(T_\\perp\\), the temperature corresponding to motions perpendicular to the magnetic field, and \\(T_\\parallel\\), the temperature corresponding to motions parallel to the magnetic field. If for some reason (e.g., anisotropic heating or compression) the temperature develops an anisotropy such that \\(T_\\perp \\neq T_\\parallel\\) and if collisions are infrequent, this anisotropy will persist for a long time, since collisions are the means by which the two temperatures equilibrate. Thus, rather than assuming that the MHD pressure is fully isotropic, we consider the less restrictive situation where the MHD pressure tensor is given by \\[\n\\overleftrightarrow{P}^{\\mathrm{MHD}} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\np_\\perp & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & p_\\perp & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & p_\\parallel\n\\end{bmatrix} =\np_\\perp\\mathbf{I} + (p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)\\hat{b}\\hat{b}\n\\]\nThe first two coordinates (\\(x, y\\)-like) in the above matrix refer to the directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and the third coordinate (\\(z\\)-like) refers to the direction parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The tensor expression on the right-hand side is equivalent (here \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the unit tensor) but allows for arbitrary, curvilinear geometry. We now develop separate adiabatic relations for the perpendicular and parallel directions:\n\nParallel direction: here the number of dimensions is \\(N = 1\\) so that \\(\\gamma = 3\\) and so the adiabatic law gives \\[\n\\frac{p_\\parallel^{1D}}{\\rho_{1D}^3}=\\mathrm{const.}\n\\tag{8.42}\\] where \\(\\rho_{1D}\\) is the one-dimensional mass density; i.e., \\(\\rho_{1D}\\sim 1/L\\), where \\(L\\) is the length along the flux tube in Figure 8.1. The three-dimensional mass density, which has been used implicitly until now, has the proportionality \\(\\rho\\sim 1/LA\\), where \\(A\\) is the cross-section of the flux tube; similarly the three-dimensional pressure has the proportionality \\(p_\\parallel \\sim \\rho T_\\parallel\\). However, we must be careful to realize that \\(p_\\parallel^{1D}\\sim\\rho_{1D}T_\\parallel\\) so, using \\(BA=\\mathrm{const.}\\), Equation 8.42 can be recast as \\[\n\\mathrm{const.} = \\frac{p_\\parallel^{1D}}{\\rho_{1D}^3} \\sim \\frac{\\rho_{1D}T_\\parallel}{\\rho_{1D}^3} \\sim T_\\parallel \\rho_{1D}^2 \\sim \\left( \\frac{1}{LA} \\right) T_\\parallel (LA)^3 B^2\n\\] or \\[\n\\frac{p_\\parallel B^2}{\\rho^3} = \\mathrm{const.}\n\\tag{8.43}\\]\nPerpendicular direction: here the number of dimensions is \\(N = 2\\) so that \\(\\gamma = 2\\) and the adiabatic law gives \\[\n\\frac{p_\\perp^{2D}}{\\rho_{2D}^2}=\\mathrm{const.}\n\\tag{8.44}\\] where \\(p_\\perp^{2D}\\) is the 2-D perpendicular pressure, and has dimensions of energy per unit area, while \\(\\rho_{2D}\\) is the 2-D mass density and has dimensions of mass per unit area. Thus, \\(\\rho_{2D}\\sim 1/A\\) so \\(p_\\perp^{2D}\\sim\\rho_{2D}T_\\perp \\sim T_\\perp/A\\), in which case Equation 8.44 can be recast as \\[\n\\mathrm{const.} = \\frac{p_\\parallel B^2}{\\rho^3} = T_\\perp A \\sim \\left( \\frac{1}{LA} \\right) T_\\perp \\frac{LA}{B}\n\\] or \\[\n\\frac{p_\\perp}{\\rho B} = \\mathrm{const.}\n\\tag{8.45}\\]\n\nEquation 8.43 and Equation 8.45 are called the double adiabatic or CGL laws after Chew, Goldberger, and Low (Chew, Goldberger, and Low 1956) who first developed these laws.\nSingle adiabatic law\nIf collisions are sufficiently frequent to equilibrate the perpendicular and parallel temperatures, then the pressure tensor becomes fully isotropic and the dimensionality of the system is \\(N = 3\\) so that \\(\\gamma = 5/3\\). There is now just one pressure and one temperature and the adiabatic relation becomes \\[\n\\frac{p}{\\rho^{5/3}} = \\mathrm{const.}\n\\tag{8.46}\\]\n\n\n8.6.2.2 MHD approximations for Maxwell’s equations\nThe various assumptions contained in MHD lead to a simplifying approximation of Maxwell’s equations. In particular, the assumption of charge neutrality in MHD makes Poisson’s equation superfluous because Poisson’s equation prescribes the relationship between non-neutrality and the electrostatic component of the electric field. The assumption of charge neutrality also has implications for the current density. To see this, the two-fluid continuity equation is multiplied by \\(q_s\\) and then summed over species to obtain the charge conservation equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\sum_s n_s q_s \\right) + \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J} = 0\n\\tag{8.47}\\]\nThus, charge neutrality implies \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J} = 0\n\\]\nLet us now consider Ampère’s law \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\]\nTaking the divergence gives \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\n\\] which is equivalent to Equation 8.47 if Poisson’s equation is invoked.\nFinally, MHD is restricted to phenomena having characteristic velocities \\(V_{\\mathrm{ph}}\\) slow compared to the speed of light in vacuum, \\(c=(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)^{-1/2}\\). Again, \\(t_{\\mathrm{char}}\\) is assumed to represent the characteristic time scale for a given phenomenon and \\(l_{\\mathrm{char}}\\) is assumed to represent the corresponding characteristic length scale so that \\(V_{\\mathrm{ph}}\\sim l_{\\mathrm{char}}/t_{\\mathrm{char}}\\). Faraday’s equation gives the scaling \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = -\\dot{\\mathbf{B}} \\rightarrow E \\sim B l_{\\mathrm{char}}/t_{\\mathrm{char}}\n\\] On comparing the magnitude of the displacement current term in Ampère’s law to the left-hand side it is seen that \\[\n\\frac{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0|\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}|}{|\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}|} \\sim \\frac{c^{-2} E/t_{\\mathrm{char}}}{B/l_{\\mathrm{char}}} \\sim \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ph}}}{c} \\right)^2\n\\]\nThus, if \\(V_{\\mathrm{ph}} \\ll c\\) the displacement current term can be dropped from Amperè’s law resulting in the so-called “pre-Maxwell” form (i.e. Darwin approximation) \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}\n\\tag{8.48}\\]\nThe divergence of Equation 8.48 gives \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J}=0\\) so it is unnecessary to specify it separately.\n\n\n8.6.2.3 Complete equation set\nIn the most common sense, ideal MHD involves equations of compressible, adiabatic and inviscid fluid: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf{u}) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\rho\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u} - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B} + p^\\ast \\right) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[ (\\mathcal{E} + p^\\ast)\\mathbf{u} - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) \\right] = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} - \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = 0 \\\\\np^\\ast = p + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{2\\mu_0} \\\\\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{p}{\\gamma - 1} + \\frac{\\rho \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}}{2} + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{2\\mu_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.49}\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the mass density, \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) the velocity, \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) the total energy density, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) the magnetic field, \\(p\\) the thermal pressure, and \\(\\gamma\\) the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats). Microscopic dissipations of any kind (viscosity, resistivity, or conduction) are not included in ideal MHD. Note that there is only one constant \\(\\mu_0\\) appeared in Equation 8.49. The introduction of temperature comes with a new constant \\(R\\equiv 2k_B/m\\): \\[\np = \\rho\\, R\\, T\n\\]\nMany often in simulations, the dimensionless units are applied. Equation 8.49 under the dimensionless units can be written as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_\\ast}{\\partial t_\\ast} + \\nabla_\\ast\\cdot(\\rho_\\ast\\mathbf{u}_\\ast) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_\\ast\\mathbf{u}_\\ast}{\\partial t_\\ast} + \\nabla_\\ast\\cdot\\left( \\rho_\\ast\\mathbf{u}_\\ast\\mathbf{u}_\\ast - \\mathbf{B}_\\ast\\mathbf{B}_\\ast + p_\\ast^\\ast \\right) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_\\ast}{\\partial t_\\ast} + \\nabla_\\ast\\cdot\\left[ (\\mathcal{E}_\\ast + p_\\ast^\\ast)\\mathbf{u}_\\ast - \\mathbf{B}_\\ast(\\mathbf{B}_\\ast\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_\\ast) \\right] = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}_\\ast}{\\partial t_\\ast} - \\nabla_\\ast\\times(\\mathbf{u}_\\ast\\times\\mathbf{B}_\\ast) = 0 \\\\\np_\\ast^\\ast = p_\\ast + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_\\ast\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_\\ast}{2} \\\\\n\\mathcal{E}_\\ast = \\frac{p_\\ast}{\\gamma - 1} + \\frac{\\rho_\\ast \\mathbf{u}_\\ast\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_\\ast}{2} + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_\\ast\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_\\ast}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.50}\\] where the subscripts \\(\\ast\\) denotes the variables in dimensionless units, and the adiabatic equation of state is given as \\[\np_\\ast = \\rho_\\ast T_\\ast\n\\]\nIn more theoretical derivations, for simplicity the energy equation is substituted with either single adiabatic law Equation 8.46 or double adiabatic law Equation 8.43 and Equation 8.45. If we drop the isotropic assumption and instead use separate pressure equations for the parallel and perpendicular components as in Equation 8.14, we get the anisotropic MHD equations.\nThese equations provide a self-consistent description of phenomena that satisfy all the various assumptions we have made, namely:\n\nThe plasma is charge-neutral since characteristic lengths are much longer than a Debye length;\nThe characteristic velocity of the phenomenon under consideration is slow compared to the speed of light;\nThe pressure and density gradients are parallel, so there is no electrothermal EMF;\nThe time scale is long compared to both the electron and ion cyclotron periods.\n\nEven though these assumptions are self-consistent, they may not accurately portray a real plasma and so MHD models, while intuitively appealing, must be used with caution.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that MHD plasmas can be categorized yet another way, namely according to the relative importance of the magnetic force \\(\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) compared to the hydrodynamic force \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}\\). If the magnetic force is negligible compared to the hydrodynamic force, then there is not much point in using MHD because in this case the system of equations is simply classical hydrodynamics. Thus, the only non-trivial MHD situations are where the magnetic and hydrodynamic forces are of comparable importance or where the magnetic force is much more important than the hydrodynamic force. Using Equation 8.48, the nominal ratio of the hydrodynamic force to the magnetic force is defined as \\[\n\\beta = \\frac{p}{B^2/2\\mu_0} \\sim \\frac{\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftarrow{P}}{\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}} \\sim \\frac{p/L}{B^2/2\\mu_0 L}\n\\]\nThe characteristic gradient scale length \\(L\\) is assumed to be comparable for both types of forces and so cancels out in the comparison. Low-\\(\\beta\\) plasmas are those where \\(B^2/2\\mu_0\\) is much larger than \\(p\\) so the hydrodynamic force is negligible compared to the magnetic force, whereas \\(\\beta = \\mathcal{O}(1)\\) plasmas are those where the magnetic and hydrodynamic forces are comparable. The different \\(\\beta\\) regime has important implications on the validity of many approximations seen in later chapters.\n\n\n\n8.6.3 Hall MHD\nAs an extension to the ideal/resistive MHD model, Hall MHD decouples the electron and ion motions by retrieving the Hall term in the generalized Ohm’s law \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}+\\eta\\mathbf{J}+\\frac{1}{en}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{\\nabla p_e}{ne}\n\\tag{8.51}\\] where the first term on the right-hand-side is the convective term, the second is the resistive term, the third is the Hall term, and the fourth is the electron pressure gradient term. The electron pressure scalar is simplified from the electron pressure tensor, which is obtained from an independent electron pressure equation.\nThe Hall MHD equations are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}&=-\\nabla\\cdot \\left(\\rho \\mathbf{u} \\right) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho\\mathbf{u})}{\\partial t}&=-\\nabla\\cdot \\left(\\rho\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}+(p+p_e)\\bar{\\bar{I}}+\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\bar{\\bar{I}}-\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} \\right) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t}&=-\\nabla\\cdot\\left[ \\left(\\epsilon+p\\right)\\mathbf{u} +(\\epsilon_e + p_e)\\mathbf{u}_e+\\mathbf{u}_e\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}^2}{\\mu_0}\\bar{\\bar{I}}-\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0}\\right) - \\mathbf{B}\\times\\eta\\mathbf{J} \\right] \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} &= -\\nabla\\times\\left[ \\mathbf{u}_e \\times\\mathbf{B} + \\eta\\mathbf{J} - \\frac{\\nabla p_e}{ne}\\right] \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot \\left(p_e\\mathbf{u}_e \\right)&=-(\\gamma-1)p_e\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_e\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.52}\\] where \\(\\bar{\\bar{I}}\\) is the identity matrix, \\(\\rho\\) is the mass density, \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the plasma bulk velocity, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the magnetic field, \\(p_e\\) is the electron pressure, \\(p\\) is the ion thermal pressure, \\(\\mathbf{J}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}/\\mu_0\\) is the current density, \\(\\epsilon=\\rho\\mathbf{u}^2/2\\) is the hydrodynamic energy density, and \\(\\epsilon_e=\\rho\\mathbf{u}_e^2/2\\) is the electron hydrodynamic energy density. The Hall velocity is defined as \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_H=-\\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{ne}\n\\tag{8.53}\\] and the electron bulk velocity is given by \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_e = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_H\n\\tag{8.54}\\]\nThe total energy density is (I may have a coefficient error here for \\(p_e\\)!) \\[\ne= \\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\mathbf{u}^2+\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}(p+p_e)+\\frac{\\mathbf{B}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index. Note that in Hall MHD only \\((\\rho,\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{B},p,p_e)\\) are unknowns; all others are derived quantities.\nOne important thing to recognize is that while ideal MHD has no intrinsic scales, Hall MHD introduces a new characteristic length scale into the system – the ion skin depth \\(d_i\\). In ideal MHD, when the plasma beta is low, the speed of the shear Alfvén mode and the fast magnetosonic mode become approximately equal. This is known as degeneracy, which means it is difficult to distinguish between the two modes, as they essentially travel at the same speed. In Hall MHD, when the wavelength of the waves becomes comparable to \\(d_i\\), the distinction between the shear Alfvén and the fast magnetosonic modes becomes clear:\n\nFast magnetosonic waves (whistler waves) are affected by electron dynamics and propagate at higher frequencies within the Hall-MHD framework.\nShear Alfvén waves (kinetic Alfvén waves, or Alfvén-ion-cyclotron waves) are predominantly driven by ion dynamics and tend to propagate at lower frequencies.",

    "text": "8.7 Fluid Drifts Perpendicular to B\nSince a fluid element is composed of many individual particles, one would expect the fluid to have drifts perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) if the individual guiding centers have such drifts. However, since the \\(\\nabla p\\) term appears only in the fluid equations, there is a drift associated with it which the fluid elements have but the particles do not have. For each species, we have an equation of motion \\[\nmn\\Big[ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}}_{1}+\\underbrace{(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}}_{2}\\Big] = q n (\\mathbf{E}+\\underbrace{\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}}_{3}) - \\nabla p\n\\tag{8.55}\\]\nConsider the ratio of term 1 to term 3: \\[\n\\frac{\\text{term }1}{\\text{term }3} \\approx \\bigg\\lvert\\frac{mni\\omega v_\\perp}{qnv_\\perp B}\\bigg\\rvert \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_c}\n\\]\nHere we have taken \\(\\partial/\\partial t=i\\omega\\) and are concerned only with \\(\\mathbf{v}_\\perp\\). For drifts slow compared with the time scale associated with \\(\\omega_c\\), we may neglect term 1. We shall also neglect the \\((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\) term and show a posteriori that this is all right. Let \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) be uniform, but let \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) have a gradient. This is the usual situation in a magnetically confined plasma column (Fig. 3.4 ADD FIGURE!). Taking the cross product of Equation 8.55 with B, we have (neglecting the left-hand side)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 &= qn[\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}+(\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B}] - \\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n&= qn[\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{B}(\\cancel{\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{B}})-\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\\mathbf{B}^2] - \\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n&= qn[\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\\mathbf{B}^2] - \\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_\\perp = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} -\\frac{\\nabla p \\times\\mathbf{B}}{qnB^2} \\equiv \\mathbf{u}_E + \\mathbf{u}_D\n\\] where \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_E\\equiv\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\\quad\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\,\\text{drift}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u}_D\\equiv-\\frac{\\nabla p\\times\\mathbf{B}}{qnB^2}\\quad\\text{Diamagnetic drift}\n\\tag{8.56}\\]\nThe drift \\(\\mathbf{u}_E\\) is the same as for guiding centers, but there is now a new drift \\(\\mathbf{u}_D\\), called the diamagnetic drift. Since \\(\\mathbf{u}_D\\) is perpendicular to the direction of the gradient, our neglect of \\((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\) is justified if \\(\\mathbf{E}=0\\). If \\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla\\phi\\neq 0\\) (i.e. a potential field), \\((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\) is still zero if \\(\\nabla\\phi\\) and \\(\\nabla p\\) are in the same direction; otherwise, there could be a more complicated solution involving \\((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\\).\nWith the help of Equation 8.12, we can write the diamagnetic drift as \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_D = \\pm \\frac{\\gamma k_B T}{eB}\\frac{\\hat{z}\\times\\nabla n}{n}\n\\tag{8.57}\\]\nIn particular, for an isothermal plasma in the geometry of Fig.3.4 (ADD IT!), in which \\(\\nabla n = \\partial n\\partial r\\hat{r} = n^\\prime\\hat{r}\\) (\\(n^\\prime &lt; 0\\)), we have the following formulas familiar to experimentalists who have worked with Q-machines \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{u}_{Di} &= \\frac{k_B T_i}{eB}\\frac{n^\\prime}{n}\\hat{\\theta} \\\\\n\\mathbf{u}_{De} &= -\\frac{k_B T_e}{eB}\\frac{n^\\prime}{n}\\hat{\\theta}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe physical reason for this drift can be seen from Figure 8.2. Here we have drawn the orbits of ions gyrating in a magnetic field. There is a density gradient toward the left, as indicated by the density of orbits. Through any fixed volume element there are more ions moving downward than upward, since the downward-moving ions come from a region of higher density. There is, therefore, a fluid drift perpendicular to \\(\\nabla n\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), even though the guiding centers are stationary. The diamagnetic drift reverses sign with \\(q\\) because the direction of gyration reverses. The magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{u}_D\\) does not depend on mass because the \\(m^{-1/2}\\) dependence of the velocity is cancelled by the \\(m^{1/2}\\) dependence of the Larmor radius—less of the density gradient is sampled during a gyration if the mass is small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Origin of the diamagnetic drift.\n\n\n\nSince ions and electrons drift in opposite directions, there is a diamagnetic current. For \\(\\gamma=Z=1\\), this is given by \\[\n\\mathbf{J}_D = ne(\\mathbf{u}_{Di} + \\mathbf{u}_{De}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\\times\\nabla\\left( p_i + p_e \\right) = (k_B T_i + k_B T_e)\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla n}{B^2}\n\\tag{8.58}\\]\nIn the particle picture, one would not expect to measure a current if the guiding centers do not drift. In the fluid picture, the current \\(\\mathbf{J}_D\\) flows wherever there is a pressure gradient. These two viewpoints can be reconciled if one considers that all experiments must be carried out in a finite-sized plasma. Suppose the plasma were in a rigid box (Fig. 3.6 ADD IT!). If one were to calculate the current from the single-particle picture, one would have to take into account the particles at the edges which have cycloidal paths. Since there are more particles on the left than on the right, there is a net current downward, in agreement with the fluid picture.\nThe reader may not be satisfied with this explanation because it was necessary to specify reflecting walls. If the walls were absorbing or if they were removed, one would find that electric fields would develop because more of one species—the one with larger Larmor radius—would collected than the other. Then the guiding centers would drift, and the simplicity of the model would be lost. Alternatively, one could imagine trying to measure the diamagnetic current with a current probe (Fig. 3.7 ADD IT!). This is just a transformer with a core of magnetic material. The primary winding is the plasma current threading the core, and the secondary is a multiturn winding all around the core. Let the whole thing be infinitesimally thin, so it does not intercept any particles. It is clear from Fig. 3.7 that a net upward current would be measured, there being higher density on the left than on the right, so that the diamagnetic current is a real current. From this example, one can see that it can be quite tricky to work with the single-particle picture. The fluid theory usually gives the right results when applied straightforwardly, even though it contains “fictitious” drifts like the diamagnetic drift.\nWhat about the grad-B and curvature drifts which appeared in the single-particle picture? The curvature drift also exists in the fluid picture, since the centrifugal force is felt by all the particles in a fluid element as they move around a bend in the magnetic field. A term \\(\\bar{F}_{cf} = \\overline{nmv_\\parallel^2}/R_c = nk_B T_\\parallel / R_c\\) has to be added to the right-hand side of the fluid equation of motion. This is equivalent to a gravitational force \\(mng\\), with \\(g = k_BT_\\parallel/m R_c\\), and leads to a drift \\(\\mathbf{u}_g=(m/q)(\\mathbf{g}\\times\\mathbf{B})/B^2\\), as in the particle picture (Equation 7.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: In a nonuniform B field the guiding centers drift but the fluid elements do not.\n\n\n\nThe grad-B drift, however, does not exist for fluids. It can be shown on thermodynamic grounds that a magnetic field does not affect a Maxwellian distribution. This is because the Lorentz force is perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and cannot change the energy of any particle. The most probable distribution \\(f(\\mathbf{v})\\) in the absence of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is also the most probable distribution in the presence of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). If \\(f(\\mathbf{v})\\) remains Maxwellian in a nonuniform \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field, and there is no density gradient, then the net momentum carried into any fixed fluid element is zero. There is no fluid drift even though the individual guiding centers have drifts; the particle drift in any fixed fluid element cancel out. To see this pictorially, consider the orbits of two particles moving through a fluid element in a nonuniform \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field (Figure 8.3). Since there is no \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field, the Larmor radius changes only because of the gradient in B; there is no acceleration, and the particle energy remains constant during the motion. If the two particles have the same energy, they will have the same velocity and Larmor radius while inside the fluid element. There is thus a perfect cancellation between particle pairs when their velocities are added to give the fluid velocity.\nWhen there is a nonuniform \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field, it is not easy to reconcile the fluid and particle pictures. Then the finite-Larmor-radius effect of Section 7.3 causes both a guiding center drift and a fluid drift, but these are not the same; in fact, they have opposite signs! The particle drift was calculated in Chapter 7, and the fluid drift can be calculated from the off-diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf{P}\\). It is extremely difficult to explain how the finite-Larmor-radius effects differ. A simple picture like Fig. 3.6 will not work because one has to take into account subtle points like the following: in the absence of a density gradient, the density of guiding centers is not the same as the density of particles! (???)\n(I need to think carefully about these pictures.)",

A particularly important result is obtained by applying Equation 8.60 to massless electrons.

Since electrons cannot leave a region en masse without leaving behind a large ion charge, the electrostatic and pressure gradient forces on the electrons must be closely in balance. This condition leads to the Boltzmann relation. Note that Equation 8.61 applies to each magnetic field lines separately. Different field lines may be charged to different potentials arbitrarily unless a mechanism is provided for the electrons to move across \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The conductors on which field lines terminate can provide such a mechanism, and the experimentalist has to take these end effects into account carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Physical reason for the Boltzmann relation between density and potential.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4 shows graphically what occurs when there is a local density clump in the plasma. Let the density gradient be toward the center of the diagram, and suppose \\(k_B T\\) is constant. There is then a pressure gradient toward the center. Since the plasma is quasineutral, the gradient exists for both the electron and ion fluids. Consider the pressure gradient force \\(\\mathbf{F}_p\\) on the electron fluid. It drives the mobile electrons away from the center, leaving the ions behind. The resulting positive charge generates a field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) whose force \\(\\mathbf{F}_E\\) on the electrons opposes \\(\\mathbf{F}_p\\). Only when \\(\\mathbf{F}_E = -\\mathbf{F}_p\\) is a steady state achieved. If \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is a constant, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is an electrostatic field \\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla\\phi\\), and \\(\\phi\\) must be large at the center, where \\(n\\) is large. This is just what Equation 8.61 tells us. The deviation from stric neutrality adjusts itself so that there is just enough charge to set up the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field required to balance the forces on the electrons.",

    "section": "8.9 The Plasma Approximation",
    "text": "8.9 The Plasma Approximation\nThe previous example reveals an important characteristic of plasmas that has wide application. We are used to solving for \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) from Poisson’s equation when we are given the charge density \\(\\sigma\\). In a plasma, the opposite procedure is generally used. \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is found from the equations of motion, and Poisson’s equation is used only to find \\(\\sigma\\). The reason is that a plasma has an overriding tendency to remain neutral. If the ions move, the electrons will follow. \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) must adjust itself so that the orbits of the electrons and ions preserve neutrality. The charge density is of secondary importance; it will adjust itself so that Poisson’s equation is satisfied. This is true, of course, only for low-frequency motions in which the electron inertia is not a factor.\nIn a plasma, it is usually possible to assume \\(n_i=n_e\\) and \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\neq 0\\) at the same time. We shall call this the plasma approximation. It is a fundamental trait of plasmas, one which is difficult for the novice to understand. Do not use Poisson’s equation to obtain \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) unless it is unavoidable! In the set of fluid equations Equation 8.13, we may now eliminate Poisson’s equation and also eliminate one of the unknowns by setting \\(n_i = n_e = n\\).\nThe plasma approximation is almost the same as the condition of quasineutrality discussed earlier but has a more exact meaning. Whereas quasineutrality refers to a general tendency for a plasma to be neutral in its state of rest, the plasma approximation is a mathematical shortcut that one can use even for wave motions. As long as these motions are slow enough that both ions and electrons have time to move, it is a good approximation to replace Poisson’s equation by the equation \\(n_i=n_e\\). Of course, if only one species can move and the other cannot follow, such as in high-frequency electron waves, then the plasma approximation is not valid, and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) must be found from Maxwell’s Equation 8.1 rather than from the ion and electron equations of motion. Ampère’s law with the displacement current retained gives the time evolution of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\left( \\frac{\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{J} \\right)\n\\]\nWe shall return to the question of the validity of the plasma approximation when we come to the theory of ion waves. At that time, it will become clear why we had to use Poisson’s equation in the derivation of Debye shielding. For electron waves, we can also show that with a simple “modified” electron test particle model that updates the electric field while keeping the magnetic field constant, we can retain the plasma oscillation and electron Berstein wave.\n\n\n\n\nBellan, Paul M. 2008.

Any realistic plasma will have a density gradient, and the plasma will tend to diffuse toward regions of low density. For example, the central problem in controlled thermonuclear reactions is to impede the rate of diffusion by using a magnetic field. Before tackling the magnetic field problem, however, we shall consider the case of diffusion in the absence of magnetic fields. A further simplification results if we assume that the plasma is weakly ionized, so that charge particles collide primarily with neutral atoms rather than with one another. The case of a fully ionized plasma is deferred to a later section, since it results in a nonlinear equation for which there are few simple illustrative solutions. In any case, partially ionized gases are not rare: High-pressure arcs and ionospheric plasmas fall into this category, and most of the early work on gas discharges involved fractional ionizations between \\(10^3\\) and \\(10^6\\), when collisions with neutral atoms are dominant.\nThe picture, then, is of a nonuniform distribution of ions and electrons in a dense background of neutrals (Fig. 5.1 ADD IT!). As the plasma spreads out as a result of pressure-gradient and electric field forces, the individual particles undergo a random walk, colliding frequently with the neutral atoms.

    "text": "9.2 Collision Parameters\nWhen an electron, say, collides with a neutral atom, it may lose any fraction of its initial momentum, depending on the angle at which it rebounds. In a head-on collision with a heavy atom, the electron can lose twice its initial momentum, since its velocity reverses sign after the collision. The probability of momentum loss can be expressed in terms of the equivalent cross section \\(\\sigma\\) that the atoms would have if they were perfect absorbers of momentum.\nIn Fig. 5.2, electrons are incident upon a slab of area \\(A\\) and thickness \\(\\mathrm{d}x\\) containing \\(n_n\\) neutral atoms per \\(\\text{m}^3\\). The atoms are imagined to be opaque spheres of cross-sectional area \\(\\sigma\\); that is, every time an electron comes within the area blocked by the atom, the electron loses all of its momentum. The number of atoms in the slab is \\(n_n A \\mathrm{d}x\\). The fraction of the slab blocked by atoms is \\(n_n A\\sigma \\mathrm{d}x / A = n_n \\sigma \\mathrm{d}x\\). If a flux \\(\\Gamma\\) of electrons is incident on the slab, the flux emerging on the other side is \\(\\Gamma^\\prime = \\Gamma(1-n_n \\sigma \\mathrm{d}x)\\).

The mean time between collisions, for particles of velocity \\(v\\), is given by \\[\n\\tau = \\lambda_m/v\n\\] and the mean frequency of collisions is \\[\n\\tau^{-1} = v/\\lambda_m = n_n \\sigma v\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\nIf we now average over particles of all velocities \\(v\\) in a Maxwellian distribution, we have what is generally called the collision frequency \\(\\nu\\): \\[\n\\nu = n_n \\overline{\\sigma v}\n\\tag{9.3}\\]",

    "section": "9.4 Decay of a Plasma by Diffusion",
    "text": "9.4 Decay of a Plasma by Diffusion\n\n9.4.1 Ambipolar Diffusion\nWe now consider how a plasma created in a container decays by diffusion to the walls. Once ions and electrons reach the wall, they recombine there. The density near the wall, therefore, is essentially zero. The fluid equations of motion and continuity govern the plasma behavior; but if the decay is slow, we need only keep the time derivative in the continuity equation. The time derivative in the equation of motion, will be negligible if the collision frequency \\(\\nu\\) is large. We thus have \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\Gamma_s = 0\n\\tag{9.8}\\] with \\(\\Gamma_s\\) given by Equation 9.7. It is clear that if \\(\\Gamma_i\\) and \\(\\Gamma_e\\) were not equal, a serious charge imbalance would soon arise. If the plasma is much larger than a Debye length, it must be quasineutral; and one would expect that the rates of diffusion of ions and electrons would somehow adjust themselves so that the two species leave at the same rate. How this happens is easy to see. The electrons, being lighter, have higher thermal velocities and tend to leave the plasma first. A positive charge is left behind, and an electric field is set up of such a polarity as to retard the loss of electrons and accelerate the loss of ions. The required \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) field is found by setting \\(\\Gamma_i=\\Gamma_e=\\Gamma\\). From @Equation 9.7, we can write \\[\n\\Gamma = \\mu_i n\\mathbf{E} - D_i \\nabla n = -\\mu_e n\\mathbf{E} - D_e\\nabla n\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{D_i - D_e}{\\mu_i + \\mu_e}\\frac{\\nabla n}{n}\n\\]\nThe common flux \\(\\Gamma\\) is then given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Gamma &= \\mu_i\\frac{D_i - D_e}{\\mu_i + \\mu_e}\\nabla n - D_i \\nabla n \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\mu_iD_i - \\mu_iD_e - \\mu_iD_i - \\mu_eD_i}{\\mu_i + \\mu_e}\\nabla n \\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\mu_iD_e + \\mu_eD_i}{\\mu_i+\\mu_e}\\nabla n\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is Fick’s law with a new diffusion coefficient \\[\nD_a \\equiv \\frac{\\mu_iD_e + \\mu_eD_i}{\\mu_i+\\mu_e}\n\\tag{9.9}\\] called the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. If this is constant, the continuity equation above becomes simply \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = D_a \\nabla^2 n\n\\tag{9.10}\\]\nThe magnitude of Da can be estimated if we take \\(\\mu_e\\gg\\mu_i\\). That this is true can be seen from Equation 9.4. Since \\(\\nu\\) is proportional to the thermal velocity, which is proportional to \\(m^{-1/2}\\), \\(\\mu\\) is proportional to \\(m^{-1/2}\\). Equation 9.4 and Equation 9.9 then give \\[\nD_a \\approx D_i + \\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_e}D_e = D_i + \\frac{T_e}{T_i}D_i\n\\]\nFor \\(T_e = T_i\\), we have \\[\nD_a \\approx 2D_i\n\\]\nThe effect of the ambipolar electric field is to enhance the diffusion of ions by a factor of two, and the diffusion rate of the two species together is primarily controlled by the slower species.\n\n\n9.4.2 Diffusion in a Slab\nThe diffusion Equation 9.10 can easily be solved by the method of separation of variables. We let \\[\nn(\\mathbf{r}, t) = T(t)S(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\nwhereupon Equation 9.10, with the subscript on \\(D_a\\) understood, becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= DT\\nabla^2 S \\\\\n\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{D}{S}\\nabla^2 S\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince the left side is a function of time alone and the right side a function of space alone, they must both be equal to the same constant, which we shall call \\(-1/\\tau\\). The function \\(T\\) then obeys the equation \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{T}{\\tau}\n\\tag{9.11}\\]\nwith the solution \\[\nT = T_0 e^{-t/\\tau}\n\\]\nThe spatial part \\(S\\) obeys the equation \\[\n\\nabla^2 S = -\\frac{1}{D\\tau} S\n\\tag{9.12}\\]\nIn slab geometry, this becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 S}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\\frac{1}{D\\tau}S\n\\tag{9.13}\\]\nwith the solution \\[\nS = A\\cos\\frac{x}{(D\\tau)^{1/2}} + B\\sin\\frac{x}{(D\\tau)^{1/2}}\n\\tag{9.14}\\]\nWe would expect the density to be nearly zero at the walls (Fig. 5.3 ADD IT!) and to have one or more peaks in between. The simplest solution is that with a single maximum. By symmetry, we can reject the odd (sine) term in Equation 9.14. The boundary conditions \\(S=0\\) at \\(x=\\pm L\\) then requires \\[\n\\frac{L}{(D\\tau)^{1/2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\] or \\[\n\\tau = \\Big( \\frac{2L}{\\pi} \\Big)^2 \\frac{1}{D}\n\\]\nCombining all the equations above, we have \\[\nn = n_0 e^{-t/\\tau} \\cos\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\n\\]\nThis is called the lowest diffusion mode. The density distribution is a cosine, and the peak density decays exponentially with time. The time constant \\(\\tau\\) increases with \\(L\\) and varies inversely with \\(D\\), as one would expect.\nThere are, of course, higher diffusion modes with more than one peak. Suppose the initial density distribution is as shown by the top curve in Fig. 5.4 ADD IT. Such an arbitrary distribution can be expanded in a Fourier series: \\[\nn = n_0 \\Big( \\sum_l a_l\\cos\\frac{(l+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi x}{L} \\sum_m b_m\\sin\\frac{m\\pi x}{L} \\Big)\n\\]\nWe have chosen the indices so that the boundary condition at \\(x=\\pm L\\) is automatically satisfied. To treat the time dependence, we can try a solution of the form \\[\nn = n_0 \\Big( \\sum_l a_l e^{-t/\\tau_l}\\cos\\frac{(l+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi x}{L} \\sum_m b_m e^{-t/\\tau_m}\\sin\\frac{m\\pi x}{L} \\Big)\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the diffusion Equation 9.10, we see that each cosine term yields a relation of the form \\[\n-\\frac{1}{\\tau_l} = -D\\Big[ \\Big(l+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\Big)\\frac{\\pi}{L} \\Big]^2\n\\]\nand similarly for the sine terms. Thus the decay time constant for the \\(l\\)th mode is given by \\[\n\\tau_l = \\Big[ \\frac{L}{(l+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi} \\Big]^2 \\frac{1}{D}\n\\]\nThe fine-grained structure of the density distribution, corresponding to large \\(l\\) numbers, decays faster, with a smaller time constant \\(\\tau_l\\). The plasma decay will proceed as indicated in Fig. 5.4 ADD IT. First, the fine structure will be washed out by diffusion. Then the lowest diffusion mode, the simple cosine distribution of Fig. 5.3 ADD IT, will be reached. Finally, the peak density continues to decay while the plasma density profile retains the same shape.\nI WANT TO DO A SIMULATION ON THIS! TRY METHODOFLINES.JL?\n\n\n9.4.3 Diffusion in a Cylinder\nThe spatial part of the diffusion equation, eq-diffusion_spatial, reads, in cylindrical geometry, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 S}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dS}{dr} + \\frac{1}{D\\tau}S = 0\n\\tag{9.15}\\]\nThis differs from Equation 9.13 by the addition of the middle term, which merely accouts for the change in coordinates. The need for the extra term is illustrated simply in Fig. 5.5 ADD IT. If a slice of plasma in (a) is moved toward larger x without being allowed to expand, the density would remain constant. On the other hand, if a shell of plasma in (b) is moved toward larger \\(r\\) with the shell thickness kept constant, the density would necessarily decrease as \\(1/r\\). Consequently, one would expect the solution to Equation 9.15 to be like a damped cosine (Fig. 5.6 ADD IT). This function is called a Bessel function of order zero, and eq-diffusion_spatial_cylinder is called Bessel’s equation (of order zero). Instead of the symbol cos, it is given the symbol \\(J_0\\). The function \\(J0(r/[D\\tau]^{1/2})\\) is a solution to eq-diffusion_spatial_cylinder, just as \\(\\cos[x/(\\mathrm{d}\\tau)^{1/2}]\\) is a solution to eq-diffusion_spatial. Both \\(\\cos kx\\) and \\(J_0(kr)\\) are expressible in terms of infinite series.\nFIGURE: Motion of a plasma slab in rectilinear and cylindrical geometry, illustrating the difference between a cosine and a Bessel function.\nTo satisfy the boundary condition \\(n=0\\) at \\(r=a\\), we must set \\(a/(D\\tau)^{1/2}\\) equal to the first zero of \\(J_0\\); namely, 2.4. This yields the decay time constant \\(\\tau\\). The plasma again decays exponentially, since the temporal part of the diffusion equation, Equation 9.11, is unchanged. We have described the lowest diffusion mode in a cylinder. Higher diffusion modes, with more than one maximum in the cylinder, will be given in terms of Bessel functions of higher order, in direct analogy to the case of slab geometry.",

    "text": "9.5 Steady State Solutions\nIn many experiments, a plasma is maintained in a steady state by continuous ionization or injection of plasma to offset the losses. To calculate the density profile in this case, we must add a source term to the equation of continuity: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} - D\\nabla^2 n = Q(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\nThe sign is chosen so that when \\(Q\\) is positive, it represents a source and contributes to positive \\(\\partial n/\\partial t\\). In steady state, we set \\(\\partial n/\\partial t=0\\) and are left with a Poisson-type equation for \\(n(\\mathbf{r})\\).\n\n9.5.1 Constant Ionization Function\nIn many weakly ionized gases, ionization is produced by energetic electrons in the tail of the Maxwellian distribution. In this case, the source term \\(Q\\) is proportional to the electron density \\(n\\). Setting \\(Q=Zn\\), where \\(Z\\) is the “ionization function”, we have \\[\n\\nabla^2 n = -(Z/D)n\n\\]\nThis is the same equation as that for S, Equation 9.12. Consequently, the density profile is a cosine or Bessel function, as in the case of a decaying plasma, only in this case the density remains constant. The plasma is maintained against diffusion losses by whatever heat source keeps the electron temperature at its constant value and by a small influx of neutral atoms to replenish those that are ionized.\n\n\n9.5.2 Plane Source\nWe next consider what profile would be obtained in slab geometry if there is a localized source on the plane \\(x=0\\). Such a source might be, for instance, a slit-collimated beam of ultraviolet light strong enough to ionize the neutral gas. The steady state diffusion equation is then \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^n}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\\frac{Q}{D}\\delta(0)\n\\]\nExcept at \\(x=0\\), the density must satisfy \\(\\partial^2 n/\\partial x^2=0\\).

The discontinuity in slope at the source is characteristic of \\(\\delta\\)-function sources.\n\n\n9.5.3 Line Source\nFinally, we consider a cylindrical plasma with a source located on the axis. Such a source might, for instance, be a beam of energetic electrons producing ionization along the axis. Except at \\(r=0\\), the density must satisfy \\[\n\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\Big(r\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial r}\\Big) = 0\n\\]\nThe solution that vanishes at \\(r=a\\) is \\[\nn = n_0 \\ln(a/r)\n\\]\nThe density becomes infinite at \\(r=0\\) (Fig. 5.8); it is not possible to determine the density near the axis accurately without considering the finite width of the source.",

To conserve momentum, a third body must be present. If this third body is an emitted photon, the process is called radiative recombination. If it is a particle, the process is called three-body recombination. The loss of plasma by recombination can be represented by a negative source term in the equation of continuity.

    "section": "9.7 Diffusion Across a Magnetic Field",
    "text": "9.7 Diffusion Across a Magnetic Field\nThe rate of plasma loss by diffusion can be decreased by a magnetic field; this is the problem of confinement in controlled fusion research. Consider a weakly ionized plasma in a magnetic field (fig-gyration-collision ADD IT!). Charged particles will move along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) by diffusion and mobility according to Equation 9.7, since \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) does not affect motion in the parallel direction. Thus we have, for each species, \\[\n\\Gamma_z = \\pm\\mu n E_z - D\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial z}\n\\]\nIf there were no collisions, particles would not diffuse at all in the perpendicular direction — they would continue to gyrate about the same magnetic field line. There are, of course, particle drifts across \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) because of electric fields or gradients in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), but these can be arranged to be parallel to the walls. For instance, in a perfectly symmetric cylinder (fig-drift-cylinder ADD IT!), the gradients are all in the radial direction, so that the guiding center drifts are in the azimuthal direction. The drifts would then be harmless.\nFIGURE: A charged particle in a magnetic field will gyrate about the same line of force until it makes a collision. #fig-gyration-collision\nFIGURE: Particle drifts in a cylindrically symmetric plasma column do not lead to losses.#fig-drift-cylinder\nWhen there are collisions, particles migrate across \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) to the walls along the gradients. They do this by a random-walk process (fig-diffusion-collision-neutral ADD IT!). When an ion, say, collides with a neutral atom, the ion leaves the collision traveling in a different direction. It continues to gyrate about the magnetic field in the same direction, but its phase of gyration is changed discontinuously. (The Larmor radius may also change, but let us suppose that the ion does not gain or lose energy on the average.)\nFIGURE: Diffusion of gyrating particles by collisions with neutral atoms.#fig-diffusion-collision-neutral\nThe guiding center, therefore, shifts position in a collision and undergoes a random walk. The particles will diffuse in the direction opposite \\(\\nabla n\\). The step length in the random walk is no longer \\(\\lambda_m\\), as in magnetic-field-free diffusion, but has instead the magnitude of the Larmor radius \\(r_L\\). Diffusion across \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) can therefore be slowed down by decreasing \\(r_L\\); that is, by increasing B.\nTo see how this comes about, we write the perpendicular component of the fluid equation of motion for either species as follows:\n\n9.7.1 Ambipolar Diffusion Across B\nBecause the diffusion and mobility coefficients are anisotropic in the presence of a magnetic field, the problem of ambipolar diffusion is not as straightforward as in the \\(B = 0\\) case. Consider the particle fluxes perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (Fig. 5.13 ADD IT!). Ordinarily, since \\(\\Gamma_{e\\perp}\\) is smaller than \\(\\Gamma_{i\\perp}\\), a transverse electric field would be set up so as to aid electron diffusion and retard ion diffusion. However, this electric field can be short-circuited by an imbalance of the fluxes along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). That is, the negative charge resulting from \\(\\Gamma_{e\\perp} &lt; \\Gamma_{i\\perp}\\) can be dissipated by electrons escaping along the field lines. Although the total diffusion must be ambipolar, the perpendicular part of the losses need not be ambipolar. The ions can diffuse out primarily radially, while the electrons diffuse out primarily along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Whether or not this in fact happens depends on the particular experiment. In short plasma columns with the field lines terminating on conducting plates, one would expect the ambipolar electric field to be short-circuited out. Each species then diffuses radially at a different rate. In long, thin plasma columns terminated by insulating plates, one would expect the radial diffusion to be ambipolar because escape along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is arduous.\nMathematically, the problem is to solve simultaneously the continuity Equation 9.8 for ions and electrons. It is not the fluxes \\(\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_j\\), but the divergence \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_j\\) which must be set equal to each other. Separating \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_j\\) into perpendicular and parallel components, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_i &= \\nabla_\\perp\\cdot(\\mu_i n \\mathbf{E}_\\perp - D_{i\\perp}\\nabla n) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Big( \\mu_inE_z - D_i\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial z} \\Big) \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_e &= \\nabla_\\perp\\cdot(\\mu_e n \\mathbf{E}_\\perp - D_{e\\perp}\\nabla n) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Big( -\\mu_enE_z - D_e\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial z} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe equation resulting from setting \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_i = \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_e\\) cannot easily be separated into one-dimensional equations. Furthermore, the answer depends sensitively on the boundary conditions at the ends of the field lines. Unless the plasma is so long that parallel diffusion can be neglected altogether, there is no simple answer to the problem of ambipolar diffusion across a magnetic field.",

    "section": "9.8 Collisions in Fully Ionized Plasmas",
    "text": "9.8 Collisions in Fully Ionized Plasmas\nWhen the plasma is composed of ions and electrons alone, all collisions are Coulomb collisions between charged particles. However, there is a distinct difference between\n\ncollisions between like particles (ion–ion or electron–electron collisions) and\ncollisions between unlike particles (ion–electron or electron–ion collisions).\n\nConsider two identical particles colliding (Fig. 5.16 ADD IT!). If it is a head-on collision, the particles emerge with their velocities reversed; they simply interchange their orbits, and the two guiding centers remain in the same places. The result is the same as in a glancing collision, in which the trajectories are hardly disturbed. The worst that can happen is a \\(90^\\circ\\) collision, in which the velocities are changed \\(90^\\circ\\) in direction. The orbits after collision will then be the dashed circles, and the guiding centers will have shifted. However, it is clear that the “center of mass” of the two guiding centers remains stationary. For this reason, collisions between like particles give rise to very little diffusion. This situation is to be contrasted with the case of ions colliding with neutral atoms. In that case, the final velocity of the neutral is of no concern, and the ion random-walks away from its initial position. In the case of ion–ion collisions, however, there is a detailed balance in each collision; for each ion that moves outward, there is another that moves inward as a result of the collision.\nWhen two particles of opposite charge collide, however, the situation is entirely different (Fig. 5.17 ADD IT!). The worst case is now the \\(180^\\circ\\) collision, in which the particles emerge with their velocities reversed. Since they must continue to gyrate about the magnetic field lines in the proper sense, both guiding centers will move in the same direction. Unlike-particle collisions give rise to diffusion. The physical picture is somewhat different for ions and electrons because of the disparity in mass. The electrons bounce off the nearly stationary ions and random-walk in the usual fashion. The ions are slightly jostled in each collision and move about as a result of frequent bombardment by electrons. Nonetheless, because of the conservation of momentum in each collision, the rates of diffusion are the same for ions and electrons, as we shall show.\n\n9.8.1 Plasma Resistivity\nThe fluid equations of motion including the effects of charged-particle collisions may be written as follows \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_i n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= en(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}_i\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla p_i -\\nabla\\cdot\\pmb{\\pi}_i + \\mathbf{P}_{ie} \\\\\nm_e n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_e}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= -en(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}_e\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla p_e -\\nabla\\cdot\\pmb{\\pi}_e + \\mathbf{P}_{ei}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9.16}\\]\nThe terms \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ie}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\) represent, respectively, the momentum gain of the ion fluid caused by collisions with electrons, and vice versa. The stress tensor \\(\\mathbf{P}_j\\) has been split into the isotropic part \\(p_j\\) and the anisotropic viscosity tensor \\(\\pmb{\\pi}_j\\). Like-particle collisions, which give rise to stresses within each fluid individually, are contained in \\(\\pmb{\\pi}_j\\). Since these collisions do not give rise to much diffusion, we shall ignore the terms \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\pmb{\\pi}_j\\). As for the terms \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ie}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\), which represent the friction between the two fluids, the conservation of momentum requires \\[\n\\mathbf{P}_{ie} = -\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\n\\]\nWe can write \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\) in terms of the collision frequency in the usual manner: \\[\n\\mathbf{P}_{ei} = mn(\\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_e)\\nu_{ei}\n\\]\nand similarly for \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ie}\\). Since the collisions are Coulomb collisions, one would expect \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\) to be proportional to the Coulomb force, which is proportional to \\(e^2\\) (for singly-charged ions). Furthermore, \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\) must be proportional to the density of electrons \\(n_e\\) and to the density of scattering centers \\(n_i\\), which, of course, is equal to \\(n_e\\). Finally, \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\) should be proportional to the relative velocity of the two fluids. On physical grounds, then, we can write \\(\\mathbf{P}_{ei}\\) as \\[\n\\mathbf{P}_{ei} = \\eta e^2n^2(\\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_e)\n\\tag{9.17}\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta\\) is a constant of proportionality. Comparing this with the last equation, we see that \\[\n\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{ne^2}{m}\\eta\n\\tag{9.18}\\]\nThe constant \\(\\eta\\) is the specific resistivity of the plasma; that this jibes with the usual meaning of resistivity will become clear shortly.\n\n\n9.8.2 Mechanics of Coulomb Collisions\nWhen an electron collides with a neutral atom, no force is felt until the electron is close to the atom on the scale of atomic dimensions; the collisions are like billiard-ball collisions. When an electron collides with an ion, the electron is gradually deflected by the long-range Coulomb field of the ion. Nonetheless, one can derive an effective cross section for this kind of collision. It will suffice for our purposes to give an order-of-magnitude estimate of the cross section. In Fig. 5.18 ADD IT!, an electron of velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) approaches a fixed ion of charge \\(e\\). In the absence of Coulomb forces, the electron would have a distance of closest approach \\(r_0\\), called the impact parameter. In the presence of a Coulomb attraction, the electron will be deflected by an angle \\(\\chi\\), which is related to \\(r_0\\). The Coulomb force is\nFIGURE:Orbit of an electron making a Coulomb collision with an ion.#fig-coulomb-collision\n\\[\nF = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}\n\\]\nThis force is felt during the time the electron is in the vicinity of the ion; this time is roughly \\[\nT \\approx r_0 / v\n\\]\nThe change in the electron’s momentum is therefore approximately \\[\n\\Delta(mv) = |FT| \\approx \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r_0v}\n\\]\nWe wish to estimate the cross section for large-angle collisions, in which \\(\\chi \\ge 90^\\circ\\). For a \\(90^\\circ\\) collision, the change in \\(mv\\) is of the order of \\(mv\\) itself. Thus \\[\n\\Delta(mv) \\simeq mv \\simeq e^2/4\\pi\\epsilon_0r_0v,\\quad r_0 = e^2/4\\pi\\epsilon_0 mv^2\n\\tag{9.19}\\]\nThe cross section is then \\[\n\\sigma = \\pi r_0^2 = e^4 / 16\\pi\\epsilon_0^2 m^2v^4\n\\]\nThe collision frequency is, therefore, \\[\n\\nu_{ei} = n\\sigma v = ne^4/16\\pi\\epsilon_0^2 m^2 v^3\n\\tag{9.20}\\]\nand the resistivity is \\[\n\\eta = \\frac{m}{ne^2}\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0^2 mv^3}\n\\tag{9.21}\\]\nFor a Maxwellian distribution of electrons, we may replace \\(v^2\\) by \\(k_B T_e/m\\) for our order-of-magnitude estimate: \\[\n\\eta \\approx \\frac{\\pi e^2m^{1/2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}\n\\tag{9.22}\\]\nThis is the resistivity based on large-angle collisions alone. In practice, because of the long range of the Coulomb force, small-angle collisions are much more frequent, and the cumulative effect of many small-angle deflections turns out to be larger than the effect of large-angle collisions. It was shown by Spitzer that Equation 9.22 should be multiplied by a factor \\(\\ln \\Lambda\\): \\[\n\\eta\\approx\\frac{\\pi e^2m^{1/2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}\\ln\\Lambda\n\\tag{9.23}\\] where \\[\n\\Lambda = \\overline{\\lambda_D/r_0} = 12\\pi n\\lambda_D^3\n\\]\nThis factor represents the maximum impact parameter, in units of \\(r_0\\) as given by Equation 9.19, averaged over a Maxwellian distribution. The maximum impact parameter is taken to be \\(\\lambda_D\\) because Debye shielding suppresses the Coulomb field at larger distances. Although \\(\\Lambda\\) depends on \\(n\\) and \\(k_BT_e\\), its logarithm is insensitive to the exact values of the plasma parameters. Typical values of \\(\\ln \\Lambda\\) are given below (\\(\\lambda_D\\) defined in Section 2.4).\n\n\n\n\\(k_B T_e\\,[\\text{eV}]\\)\n\\(n\\,[\\text{m}^{-3}]\\)\n\\(\\ln\\Lambda\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(0.2\\)\n\\(10^{15}\\)\n10.7\n(Q-machine)\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\\(10^{17}\\)\n11.8\n(lab plasma)\n\n\n\\(100\\)\n\\(10^{19}\\)\n15.4\n(typical torus)\n\n\n\\(10^4\\)\n\\(10^{21}\\)\n20.0\n(fusion reactor)\n\n\n\\(10^3\\)\n\\(10^{27}\\)\n9.6\n(laser plasma)\n\n\n\nIt is evident that \\(\\ln \\Lambda\\) varies only a factor of two as the plasma parameters range over many orders of magnitude. For most purposes, it will be sufficiently accurate to let \\(\\ln \\Lambda=10\\) regardless of the type of plasma involved.\n\n\n9.8.3 Physical Meaning of η\nLet us suppose that an electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) exists in a plasma and that the current that it drives is all carried by the electrons, which are much more mobile than the ions. Let \\(B=0\\) and \\(k_BT_e=0\\), so that \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P}_e=0\\). Then, in steady state, the electron equation of motion from Equation 9.16 reduces to \\[\nen\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{P}_{ei}\n\\tag{9.24}\\]\nSince \\(\\mathbf{j}=en(\\mathbf{v}_i-\\mathbf{v}_e)\\), Equation 9.17 can be written \\[\n\\mathbf{P}_{ei} = \\eta en\\mathbf{j}\n\\] so that Equation 9.24 becomes \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = \\eta\\mathbf{j}\n\\tag{9.25}\\]\nThis is simply Ohm’s law, and the constant \\(\\eta\\) is just the specific resistivity. The expression for \\(\\eta\\) in a plasma, as given by Equation 9.22 or Equation 9.23, has several features which should be pointed out.\n\nIn Equation 9.23, we see that \\(\\eta\\) is independent of density (except for the weak dependence in \\(\\ln\\Lambda\\)). This is a rather surprising result, since it means that if a field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is applied to a plasma, the current \\(\\mathbf{j}\\), as given by Equation 9.25, is independent of the number of charge carriers. The reason is that although \\(j\\) increases with \\(n_e\\), the frictional drag against the ions increases with \\(n_i\\). Since \\(n_e=n_i\\) these two effects cancel. This cancellation can be seen in Equation 9.20 and Equation 9.21. The collision frequency \\(\\nu_{ei}\\) is indeed proportional to \\(n\\), but the factor \\(n\\) cancels out in \\(\\eta\\). A fully ionized plasma behaves quite differently from a weakly ionized one in this respect. In a weakly ionized plasma, we have \\(\\mathbf{j}=-ne\\mathbf{v}_e,\\mathbf{v}_e=-\\mu_e\\mathbf{E}\\), so that \\(\\mathbf{j}=ne\\mu_e\\mathbf{E}\\). Since the electron mobility \\(\\mu_e\\) depends only on the density of neutrals, the current is proportional to the plasma density \\(n\\).\nEquation 9.23 shows that \\(\\eta\\) is proportional to \\(T_e^{-3/2}\\). As a plasma is heated, the Coulomb cross section decreases, and the resistivity drops rather rapidly with increasing temperature. Plasmas at thermonuclear temperatures (tens of keV) are essentially collisionless; this is the reason so much theoretical research is done on collisionless plasmas. Of course, there must always be some collisions; otherwise, there wouldn’t be any fusion reactions either. An easy way to heat a plasma is simply to pass a current through it. The \\(I^2R\\) or \\(\\eta j^2\\) losses then turn up as an increase in electron temperature. This is called ohmic heating. The \\((k_BT_e)^{-3/2}\\) dependence of \\(\\eta\\), however, does not allow this method to be used up to thermonuclear temperatures. The plasma becomes such a good conductor at temperatures above 1 keV that ohmic heating is a very slow process in that range.\nEquation 9.20 shows that \\(\\nu_{ei}\\) varies as \\(v^{-3}\\). The fast electrons in the tail of the velocity distribution make very few collisions. The current is therefore carried mainly by these electrons rather than by the bulk of the electrons in the main body of the distribution. The strong dependence on \\(v\\) has another interesting consequence. If an electric field is suddenly applied to a plasma, a phenomenon known as electron runaway can occur. A few electrons which happen to be moving fast in the direction of \\(-\\mathbf{E}\\) when the field is applied will have gained so much energy before encountering an ion that they can make only a glancing collision. This allows them to pick up more energy from the electric field and decrease their collision cross section even further. If E is large enough, the cross section falls so fast that these runaway electrons never make a collision. They form an accelerated electron beam detached from the main body of the distribution.\n\n\n\n9.8.4 Numerical Values of η\nExact computations of \\(\\eta\\) which take into account the ion recoil in each collision and are properly averaged over the electron distribution were first given by Spitzer. The following result for hydrogen is sometimes called the Spitzer resistivity:\n\\[\n\\eta_\\parallel = 5.2\\times 10^{-5}\\frac{Z\\ln\\Lambda}{T^{3/2}[\\text{eV}]}\\, [\\text{ohm}\\cdot\\text{m}]\n\\tag{9.26}\\]\nHere \\(Z\\) is the ion charge number, which we have taken to be 1 elsewhere. Since the dependence on \\(m_i\\) is weak, these values can also be used for other gases. The subscript \\(\\parallel\\) means that this value of \\(\\eta\\) is to be used for motions parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). For motions perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), one should use \\(\\eta_\\perp\\) given by\n\\[\n\\eta_\\perp = 2.0 \\eta_\\parallel\n\\]\nThis does not mean that conductivity along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is only two times better than conductivity across \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). A factor like \\(\\omega_c^2\\tau^2\\) still has to be taken into account. The factor 2.0 comes from a difference in weighting of the various velocities in the electron distribution. In perpendicular motions, the slow electrons, which have small Larmor radii, contribute more to the resistivity than in parallel motions.\nFor \\(k_BT_e=100\\, \\text{eV}\\), Equation 9.26 yields\n\\[\n\\eta = 5\\times 10^{-7}\\, [\\text{ohm}\\cdot\\text{m}]\n\\]\nThis is to be compared with various metallic conductors:\n\n\n\nmaterial\n\\(\\eta\\, [\\text{ohm}\\cdot\\text{m}]\\)\n\n\n\n\ncopper\n\\(2\\times10^{-8}\\)\n\n\nstainless steel\n\\(7\\times10^{-7}\\)\n\n\nmercury\n\\(1\\times10^{6}\\)\n\n\n\nA 100-eV plasma, therefore, has a conductivity like that of stainless steel.\n\n\n9.8.5 Pulsed Currents\nWhen a steady-state current is drawn between two electrodes aligned along the magnetic field, electrons are the dominant current carrier, and sheaths are set up at the cathode to limit the current to the set value. When the current is pulsed, however, it takes time to set up the current distribution. It was shown by Stenzel and Urrutia that this time is controlled by whistler waves (R-waves), which must travel the length of the device to communicate the voltage information.\n\n\n9.8.6 Collisions Between Species\nY.Y talked about this during his lecture that the collision rate among ions or electrons is much larger than the collision rate between ions and electrons. I need to go back to the notes. See also StackExchange Q&A.\n\n\n9.8.7 Conductivity Tensor\nResistivity is the inverse of conductivity. Consider the effect of collisions as friction in the equation of motion for electrons: \\[\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_e}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}_e\\times\\mathbf{B}) - m\\nu_c(\\mathbf{u}_e - \\mathbf{u}^\\prime)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\prime\\) is the velocity of the collision targets.\n\nIn unmagnetized plasma, let \\(\\mathbf{B}=0\\).\n\nAssume a steady state with cold electrons (\\(\\mathbf{u}_e = \\mathbf{v}_e\\)) and non-moving targets \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\prime = 0\\), we can easily have\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{m_e\\nu_c}{e}\\mathbf{u}_e\n\\]\nSince the electron current is defined as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{j} = -en_e\\mathbf{u}_e\n\\]\nwe have from the last two equations\n\\[\n\\mathbf{j} = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e\\nu_c}\\mathbf{E} \\equiv \\sigma\\mathbf{E}\n\\tag{9.27}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma\\) is the classical conductivity.\n\nIn magnetized plasma, let \\(\\mathbf{B}=b\\hat{z}\\).\n\nSimilar to the steady unmagnetized case,\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_e\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nu_c m_e\\mathbf{u}_e\n\\]\nIn order to avoid confusion, let \\(\\sigma_0\\) denote the classical conductivity from Equation 9.27. Using the definition of current density and writing in scalar forms, we now have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nj_x &= \\sigma_0 E_x - \\frac{\\Omega_e}{\\nu_c}j_y \\\\\nj_y &= \\sigma_0 E_y - \\frac{\\Omega_e}{\\nu_c}j_x \\\\\nj_z &= \\sigma_0 E_z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nthe solution of which gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nj_x &= \\frac{\\nu_c^2}{\\nu_c^2 + \\Omega_e^2}\\sigma_0 E_x - \\frac{\\Omega_e \\nu_c}{\\nu_c^2 + \\Omega_e^2}E_y \\\\\nj_y &= \\frac{\\nu_c^2}{\\nu_c^2 + \\Omega_e^2}\\sigma_0 E_y - \\frac{\\Omega_e \\nu_c}{\\nu_c^2 + \\Omega_e^2}E_x \\\\\nj_z &= \\sigma_0 E_z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nor in matrix form,\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} j_x \\\\ j_y \\\\ j_z \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_P & -\\sigma_H & 0 \\\\ \\sigma_H & \\sigma_P & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_\\parallel \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} E_x \\\\ E_y \\\\ E_z \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_P &= \\frac{\\nu_c^2}{\\nu_c^2 + \\Omega_e^2}\\sigma_0\\quad\\text{Pedersen conductivity}&(\\perp\\mathbf{B}\\&\\parallel\\mathbf{E}) \\\\\n\\sigma_H &= \\frac{\\Omega_e \\nu_c}{\\nu_c^2 + \\Omega_e^2}\\sigma_0\\quad\\text{Hall conductivity}&(\\perp\\mathbf{B}\\&\\perp\\mathbf{E}) \\\\\n\\sigma_\\parallel &= \\sigma_0 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e\\nu_c}\\quad\\text{parallel conductivity}&(\\parallel\\mathbf{B})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMagnetic field-aligned currents (FACs) are very important in plasma physics. From ?fig-conductivity, we see that \\(\\Omega_e \\simeq \\nu_c\\) is the most complicated regime where the three conductivities are comparable, and \\(\\Omega_e \\gg \\nu_c\\) is the most anisotropic regime as particles are tightly bound in the perpendicular direction but free to move along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\nKeyNotes.plot_conductivity()\nThe study of conductivity is most relevant in the Earth’s ionosphere, where \\(\\Omega_e \\simeq \\nu_c\\) happens at about 100 km above from the ground, and \\(\\sigma_0\\) is on the order of 100 S/m. Ionosphere forms within the atmosphere through the mechanisms of electron impact ionization and photoionization and in turn contribute in a crucial way to the plasma interactions. The ionosphere is electrically conductive and thus carry part of a current system that is continued outside the ionosphere by plasma currents. The properties of the ionospheric currents are usually described in terms of the electrical conductivity of the ionosphere. Because a strong background magnetic field threads the ionosphere, the conductivities are strongly anisotropic. In the direction of the magnetic field, the conductivity is referred to as the parallel or Birkeland conductivity. The Birkeland conductivity \\(\\sigma_\\parallel\\) is so high that it short-circuits the field-aligned component of the ionospheric electric field, and normally electrical equipotentials align with the ionospheric magnetic field lines for quasi-static (\\(&gt;1\\,\\text{min}\\)) large-scale electrodynamic conditions. Perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, the conductivity has components parallel to the electric field \\(\\sigma_P\\) and perpendicular to the electric field \\(\\sigma_H\\).\nBecause the electric field vanishes in the field-aligned direction through the ionosphere (\\(\\mathbf{E}_\\parallel = 0\\)), it is meaningful to integrate the transverse \\(\\sigma_P\\) and \\(\\sigma_H\\) along the magnetic field direction to evaluate the Pedersen and Hall conductances \\(\\Sigma_P\\) and \\(\\Sigma_H\\), respectively. For any \\(\\mathbf{E}\\),\n\\[\n\\pmb{\\Sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\Sigma_P\\mathbf{E} + \\Sigma_H\\hat{b}\\times\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nThe continuity of currents gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{j} + \\frac{\\partial \\rho^\\ast}{\\partial t} = 0 \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\pmb{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}) = -\\frac{\\partial \\rho^\\ast}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\int \\nabla\\cdot(\\pmb{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}) dz = -\\int \\frac{\\partial \\rho^\\ast}{\\partial t} dz \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\int\\pmb{\\sigma}dz\\cdot\\mathbf{E}) = -\\rho^\\ast v_\\parallel \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\pmb{\\Sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}) = - j_\\parallel \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\pmb{\\Sigma}\\cdot\\nabla\\Phi) = j_\\parallel\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9.28}\\]\n\\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla\\Phi\\), and \\(j_\\parallel\\) is defined such that upward (\\(+z\\)) is considered positive. Here we assume that \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is aligned with \\(\\hat{z}\\); a more realistic geometry requires the consideration of inclination angle. See Equation 23.1 and note the sign difference between the definitions of \\(j_\\parallel\\).\nThe forces that act on a flux tube in the ionosphere can be expressed in terms of these conductances and the force balance expressions can consequently be used to derive other properties of the ionospheric flow such as its velocity. (???)\nMass loading contributes to the electrodynamics of the plasma interaction in ways that are analogous to the contributions of the ionospheric conductivities. Pickup ionization conserves momentum. An increase of the ion density results in a reduction of the flow velocity and its associated electric field. Thus in developing the theory of the interaction, pickup effects can be directly incorporated into the above conductances and the interaction region extends well above the atmospheric exobase.\nThe Pedersen current (aligned with the electric field) exerts forces that slow the flow in the ionosphere. The Hall current flows perpendicular to the electric and magnetic field, thereby breaking the symmetry of the interaction. The Hall current results in a rotation of the flow away from the corotation direction and produces ionospheric asymmetries.",

    "section": "9.10 Pitch Angle Scattering",
    "text": "9.10 Pitch Angle Scattering\nThis section first follows Tautz et al. (2013). This paper gives the definition of pitch angle scattering in terms of diffusion coefficient, typical behavior of pitch angle scattering, and consequent pitch angle distribution.\nStrongly pitch-angle–anisotropic phase space distribution functions cannot be properly accounted for by the diffusion approximation. Examples include solar energetic particles (SEPs), heliospheric particle populations such as Jovian electron jets and suprathermal ion species accelerated at interplanetary traveling shocks.\nThe key to this problem is the determination of the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\) that occurs in the Fokker-Planck transport equation. In general, one can distinguish at least three different methods of addressing this problem.\nFirst, the wave number k-dependence of the turbulent power spectrum \\(G(k)\\) can be specified to derive analytical approximations for \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\). The quasi-linear theory (QLT) derived by Jokipii (1966) has been the standard theory, until it was realized that QLT is not only inaccurate but, in fact, invalid for some scenarios. For the example of isotropic turbulence, it has been known that QLT cannot properly describe pitch-angle scattering, because it neglects 90° scattering and leads to infinitely large mean-free paths. This problem was remedied by the application of the second-order QLT (Shalchi 2005; Tautz et al. 2008), which considers deviations from the unperturbed spiral orbits that were assumed in QLT.\nSecond, to allow for more complex turbulence properties and to validate the permissibility of the analytical perturbation theories, one can resort to test particle simulations in specified turbulent magnetic fields. By tracing particle trajectories, the mean square displacements and the associated diffusion parameters can be obtained.\nThird, rather than entirely specifying the turbulent magnetic fields, one can perform direct numerical simulations to compute solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic equations, while the test-particle trajectories are still integrated as in the previous method. Such computations do not require assumptions regarding the turbulence spectrum that is seen by the energetic particles. They are, however, limited regarding the extent of the inertial range of the turbulence spectrum, owing to computational constraints.\nPerhaps the most important transport process of high-energy particles is represented by pitch-angle scattering, i.e., by stochastic variations in \\(\\mu = v_\\parallel / v = \\cos\\theta\\) with range \\([-1,1]\\) , where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) the mean magnetic field and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) the particle velocity. This process is related to diffusion along the mean magnetic field, which is described by the parallel diffusion coefficient, \\(\\kappa_\\parallel\\), or the parallel mean free path, \\(\\lambda_\\parallel = (3/v)\\kappa_\\parallel\\), which are also related to the cosmic ray anisotropy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Pitch-angle cosine, \\(\\mu = v_\\parallel/v\\) as a function of the normalized time, \\(\\tau = \\Omega t\\) for a relative slab turbulence strength \\(\\delta B/B_0 = 10^{-2}\\). Four particles with initial pitch angles in the range \\(0.1 &lt; \\mu_0 &lt; 0.8\\) are highlighted.\n\n\n\nThe time evolution of the pitch angle is shown in Figure 9.3 for a sample of typical single-particle trajectories. It is indeed confirmed that particles with \\(\\mu\\approx[0, \\pm 1]\\) almost retain their original pitch angle. However, scattering through 90° can occur, a fact that is not included in QLT.\n\n9.10.1 Definition of Pitch Angle Scattering\nThe usual definition of pitch-angle scattering can be found in the so-called Taylor-Green-Kubo (TGK) formalism (Taylor 1922; Green 1951; Kubo 1957; Shalchi 2011) as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{\\mu\\mu}(\\mu) &= \\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm{d}t \\left&lt; \\dot{\\mu}(t)\\dot{\\mu}(0) \\right&gt; \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left&lt; \\Delta \\mu(t)^2 \\right&gt;\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9.30}\\] where the second line employs the definition \\(\\Delta \\mu(t) = \\mu(t) - \\mu(0)\\). It can be shown that both versions agree with each other, if \\(t\\) is high enough that the expression becomes asymptotically time-independent.\nThe combination of diffusion (Fick 1855) and random walk (Chandrasekhar 1943) motivated the usual definition of the diffusion in terms of the mean-square displacement (e.g., Tautz 2012) \\(\\kappa = \\left&lt; \\Delta x^2 \\right&gt; /(2t)\\), which can also be used for a third expression for \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\), namely \\[\nD_{\\mu\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2t}\\left&lt;  \\Delta \\mu(t)^2 \\right&gt;\n\\tag{9.31}\\] which is again valid if \\(t\\) is high enough. However, the formal limit \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\) is forbidden since \\(|\\Delta \\mu|\\) cannot exceed a value of 2. For high enough times, \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\) will always be dominated by the \\(1/t\\) dependence, independent of the choice of the formula. Therefore, a meaningful, time-independent value for \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\) can be obtained if and only if\n\n\\(t\\) is long enough that the initial conditions become insignificant;\n\\(t\\) is short enough that the behavior of \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\) is not already dominated by the \\(1/t\\) proportionality.",

    "section": "9.11 Cosmic Ray Diffusion",
    "text": "9.11 Cosmic Ray Diffusion\nCosmic-ray (CR) diffusion in turbulent and magnetized media is a fundamental problem in space physics and astrophysics. CR diffusion strongly depends on the properties of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence that they interact with. In the presence of magnetic fields, the CR diffusion perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field needs to be treated separately. Within the inertial range of MHD turbulence, the superdiffusion of turbulent magnetic fields causes the perpendicular superdiffusion of CRs. In the direction parallel to the magnetic field, most earlier studies are focused on the diffusion induced by gyroresonant scattering. Due to the scale-dependent anisotropy of Alfvén and slow modes in MHD turbulence, Alfvén and slow modes are inefficient in scattering the CRs with gyroradii much smaller than the turbulence injection scale, while fast modes are identified as the more efficient agent of scattering. In 2020s, strong scattering of CRs by sharp intermittent magnetic field bends in MHD turbulence is proposed to be important for affecting CR parallel diffusion. The enhanced local scattering can be associated with the intermittent and fractal structure of MHD turbulence.\nThe resonant scattering faces its long-standing 90° problem in the framework of the quasi-linear theory (QLT, Jokipii 1966). To resolve this issue, nonresonant interactions such as magnetic mirroring was explored. This consideration of the mirroring effect naturally solves the 90° problem and limits the pitch-angle range for gyroresonant scattering. Magnetic mirrors can naturally form in MHD turbulence due to compressions of magnetic fields, which are induced by pseudo-Alfvénic modes in an incompressible medium and slow and fast modes in a compressible medium. Unlike the trapping effect of magnetic mirrors considered for compressible MHD waves, in MHD turbulence CRs do not experience trapping due to the perpendicular superdiffusion of turbulent magnetic fields. Instead, they bounce among different magnetic mirrors and move diffusively along the local magnetic field, which leads to a new diffusion mechanism termed mirror diffusion. The mirror diffusion accounts for the suppressed diffusion of CRs when the mirroring condition is satisfied.\n\n9.11.1 Perpendicular Superdiffusion of Mirroring CRs\nThe perpendicular superdiffusion of CRs is caused by that of turbulent magnetic fields and takes place within the inertial range of MHD turbulence (Lazarian & Yan 2014). To simulate the CR scenario, each CR can be represented by a beam of charged particles initially close to each other with the same pitch-angle cosine \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(r_L\\). The superdiffusion is obtained by 1. measuring the perpendicular separation of each pair of particle trajectories and obtain its rms value for all pairs; 2. averaging over all beams as the measured perpendicular displacement \\(\\left&lt; \\sqrt{\\left&lt; \\delta x_\\perp \\right&gt;} \\right&gt;\\).\n\n\n9.11.2 Parallel Mirror Diffusion\nIn the presence of a magnetic mirror with a longitudinal magnetic gradient, CRs with \\(r_L\\) smaller than the mirror size \\(l_\\parallel\\) and \\(\\mu\\) satisfying \\[\n\\mu &lt; \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta B_\\parallel}{B_0+\\delta B_\\parallel}}\n\\tag{9.32}\\] can be reflected by the magnetic mirror under the mirror force, where \\(\\delta B_\\parallel\\) is the parallel magnetic fluctuation over \\(l_\\parallel\\) and \\(B_0\\) is the mean magnetic field strength. The mirror force is \\[\n{F}_{\\parallel }=-M\\frac{\\partial {B}_{\\parallel }}{\\partial {l}_{\\parallel }}\n\\] where M is the magnetic moment \\[\nM = \\frac{\\gamma {{mu}}_{\\perp }^{2}}{2B}\n\\]\nFor mirroring CRs with their motion along the magnetic field dominated by magnetic mirroring, there is no stochastic change of \\(\\mu\\), and M is a constant, known as the first adiabatic invariant. The particle is reflected at different mirror points (i.e., regions with stronger B) multiple times and move back and forth in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. However, in the direction perpendicular to the \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\), the particle is not trapped due to the perpendicular superdiffusion of turbulent magnetic fields (see previous subsection). As expected, CRs are not trapped between two magnetic mirror points, but diffusively move along the magnetic field in MHD turbulence due to the perpendicular superdiffusion.\n\n\n9.11.3 Transition between Mirror Diffusion and Scattering Diffusion\nCRs with sufficiently small \\(\\mu\\) (Equation 9.32) are subject to the nonresonant mirroring interaction and undergo the mirror diffusion. For CRs with larger \\(\\mu\\), their parallel diffusion is dominated by the resonant pitch-angle scattering and undergo the scattering diffusion. The transition between mirror diffusion and scattering diffusion takes place as \\(\\mu\\) stochastically changes due to the gyroresonant scattering. The transition between the two diffusion regimes is expected to occur at a critical \\(\\mu\\) as \\(\\mu_c\\).\nIn compressible MHD turbulence, under the consideration that fast modes are mainly responsible for mirroring and scattering, μc is given by (Lazarian & Xu, 2021) \\[\n{\\mu }_{c}=\\min \\{{\\mu }_{\\max },{\\mu }_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\}\n\\] where \\[\n{\\mu }_{\\max }=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta {B}_{f}}{{B}_{0}+\\delta {B}_{f}}}\n\\] and \\[\n{\\mu }_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\approx {\\left[\\frac{14}{\\pi }{\\left(\\frac{\\delta {B}_{f}}{{B}_{0}}\\right)}^{2}{\\left(\\frac{{r}_{L}}{{L}_{\\mathrm{inj}}}\\right)}^{\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\right]}^{\\tfrac{2}{11}}\n\\] corresponds to the pitch-angle cosine where mirroring and scattering are in balance, with \\(\\delta B_f\\) as the magnetic fluctuation at \\(L_\\mathrm{inj}\\) the injection length of fast modes.\nFor incompressible MHD turbulence, pseudo-Aflvén modes are responsible for mirroring. Under the consideration of inefficient scattering by Alfvén and pseudo-Alfvén modes for CRs with \\(r_L \\ll L_\\mathrm{inj}\\), we have \\[\n{\\mu }_{\\max }=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta {B}_{s}}{{B}_{0}+\\delta {B}_{s}}}\n\\] where \\(\\delta B_s\\) is the magnetic fluctuation of pseudo-Alfvén modes at \\(L_\\mathrm{inj}\\). As pseudo-Alfv́en modes are slaved to Alfv́en modes (Beresnyak & Lazarian 2019), \\(\\delta B_s /B_0\\) can be approximately by MA. Therefore, we have \\[\n\\mu_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{MA}{1 + MA}}\n\\]\nAt \\(μ\\mu &lt; \\mu_c\\), mirroring dominates scattering, and CRs are expected to undergo the mirror diffusion. At \\(\\mu &gt; \\mu_c\\), scattering becomes dominant, and CRs are expected to undergo the scattering diffusion.",

    "section": "10.2 Dispersion Relation",
    "text": "10.2 Dispersion Relation\nWaves are a very general phenonmenon of most media. In order for a wave to propagate in the medium a number of conditions need to be satisfied, however. The first is that the medium allows for a particular range of frequencies \\(\\omega\\) and wave-vectors \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) to exist in the medium; i.e., it allows for eigenmodes. These ranges are specified by the dispersion relation \\(D(\\omega,\\mathbf{k},...)=0\\) which formulates the condition that the dynamical equations of the medium possess small-amplitude solutions. This dispersion relation is usually derived in the linear infinitesimally small amplitude approximation. However, nonlinear dispersion relations can sometimes also be formulated in which case \\(D(\\omega,\\mathbf{k},|\\mathbf{a}|)\\) depends on the fluctuation amplitude \\(|\\mathbf{a}|\\) as well.\nDispersion relations describe the effect of dispersion on the properties of waves in a medium. A dispersion relation relates the wavelength or wavenumber of a wave to its frequency. Given the dispersion relation, one can calculate the phase velocity and group velocity of waves in the medium, as a function of frequency. Therefore, obtaining the dispersion relation is the key of describing the wave propagation.\n\n10.2.1 Damping/Growth Rate\nThe solutions of the dispersion relation are in most cases complex, and for real wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) can be written as \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{k}) = \\omega_r(\\mathbf{k}) + i\\gamma(\\omega_r,\\mathbf{k})\\), where the index \\(r\\) indicates the real part, and \\(\\gamma\\) is the imaginary part of the frequency which itself is a function of the real frequency and wave number, because each mode of given frequency can behave differently in time, and the wave under normal conditions will be dispersive, i.e. it will not be a linear function of wave number. In most cases the amplitude of a given wave will change slowly in time, which means that the imaginary part of the frequency is small compared to the real frequency. If this is granted, then \\(\\gamma\\) can be determined by a simple procedure directly from the dispersion relation \\(D(\\omega,\\mathbf{k}) = D_r(\\omega,\\mathbf{k}) + iD_i(\\omega,\\mathbf{k})\\), which can be written as the sum of its real \\(D_r\\) and imaginary \\(D_i\\) parts because a small imaginary part \\(\\gamma\\) in the frequency changes the dispersion relation only weakly, and it can be expanded with respect to this imaginary part. Up to first order in \\(\\gamma/\\omega\\) one then obtains2 \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_r(\\omega_r,\\mathbf{k}) &= 0 \\\\\n\\gamma(\\omega_r, \\mathbf{k}) &= -\\frac{D_i(\\omega,\\mathbf{k})}{\\partial D_r(\\omega_r,\\mathbf{k})/\\partial \\omega |_{\\gamma=0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nThe first of these expressions determines the real frequency as function of wave number \\(\\omega_r(\\mathbf{k})\\) which can be calculated directly from the real part of the dispersion relation. The second equation is a prescription to determine the imaginary part of the frequency, i.e. the damping or growth rate of the wave.",

This oscillation, also known as the Langmuir oscillation, is so fast that the massive ions do not have time to respond to the oscillating field and may be considered as fixed. In Fig. 4.2 (ADD IT!), the open rectangles represent typical elements of the ion fluid, and the darkened rectangles the alternately displaced elements of the electron fluid.

As a consequence of the last assumption, we have\n\n\\[\n\\nabla = \\hat{x}\\partial x,\\, \\mathbf{E} = E\\hat{x},\\, \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} =0,\\, \\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla\\phi\n\\]\nThere is, therefore, no fluctuating magnetic field; this is an electrostatic oscillation.\nThe electron equations of continuity and motion are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial n_e}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(n_e\\mathbf{u}_e) = 0 \\\\\nmn_e\\Big[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_e}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}_e\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_e \\Big] = -en_e\\mathbf{E}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe only Maxwell equation we shall need is the one that does not involve \\(\\mathbf{B}\\): Poisson’s equation. This case is an exception to the general rule of Section 8.9 that Poisson’s equation cannot be used to find \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). This is a high-frequency oscillation; electron inertia is important, and the deviation from neutrality is the main effect in this particular case. Consequently, we write \\[\n\\epsilon_0\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\epsilon_0 \\partial \\mathbf{E}/\\partial x = e(n_i - n_e)\n\\]\nThe last three equations together can be easily solved by the procedure of linearization. By this we mean that the amplitude of oscillation is small, and terms containing higher powers of amplitude factors can be neglected. We first separate the dependent variables into two parts: an “equilibrium” part indicated by a subscript 0, and a “perturbation” part indicated by a subscript 1: \\[\nn_e = n_0 + n_1\\quad \\mathbf{u}_e = \\mathbf{u}_0 + \\mathbf{u}_1\\quad \\mathbf{E}_e = \\mathbf{E}_0 + \\mathbf{E}_1\n\\]\nThe equilibrium quantities express the state of the plasma in the absence of the oscillation. Since we have assumed a uniform neutral plasma at rest before the electrons are displaced, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla n_0 = \\mathbf{u}_0 = \\mathbf{E}_0 = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}_0}{\\partial t} =  \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}_0}{\\partial t} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe momentum equation now becomes \\[\nm\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_1}{\\partial t} = -e\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nThe term \\((\\mathbf{u}_1\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_1\\) is seen to be quadratic in an amplitude quantity, and we shall linearize by neglecting it. The linear theory is valid as long as \\(|u_1|\\) is small enough that such quadratic terms are indeed negligible. Similarly, the continuity equation becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n_0 \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_1 = 0\n\\]\nIn Poisson’s equation, we note that \\(n_{i0}=n_{e0}\\) in equilibrium and that \\(n_{i1}=0\\) by the assumption of fixed ions, so we have \\[\n\\epsilon_0 \\partial \\mathbf{E}/\\partial x = -en_1\n\\]\nThe oscillating quantities are assumed to behave sinusoidally: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{n}_1 &= n_1 e^{i(kx-\\omega t)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{u}_1 &= \\mathbf{u}_1 e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\hat{x} \\\\\n\\mathbf{E}_1 &= \\mathbf{E}_1 e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\hat{x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe time derivative \\(\\partial/\\partial t\\) can therefore be replaced by \\(-i\\omega\\), and the gradient \\(\\nabla\\) by \\(ik\\hat{x}\\). Now the linearized equations \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} &= -n_0\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial t} &= -\\frac{e}{m}E_1 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial x} &= -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0}n_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.2}\\] become \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i\\omega n_1 &= -n_0 ik u_1 \\\\\n-im\\omega u_1 &= -eE_1 \\\\\nik\\epsilon_0 E_1 &= -en_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.3}\\]\nEliminating \\(u_1\\) and \\(E_1\\), we have \\[\nn_1 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m\\omega^2}n_1\n\\]\nIf \\(n_1\\) does not vanish, we must have \\[\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m}\n\\]\nThe plasma frequency is therefore \\[\n\\omega_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m}} \\quad \\text{rad/s}\n\\tag{10.4}\\]\nNumerically, one can use the approximate formula \\[\n\\omega_p / 2\\pi = f_p \\approx 9\\sqrt{n}\\quad \\text{m}^{-3}\n\\]\nThis frequency, depending only on the plasma density, is one of the fundamental parameters of a plasma. Because of the smallness of \\(m\\), the plasma frequency is usually very high. For instance, in a plasma of density \\(n=10^{18}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\), we have \\[\nf_p\\approx 9(10^{18})^{1/2} = 9\\times 10^9\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 9\\,\\text{GHz}\n\\]\nRadiation at \\(f_p\\) normally lies in the microwave range. We can compare this with another electron frequency: \\(\\omega_c\\). A useful numerical formula is \\[\nf_{ce}\\simeq 28\\,\\text{GHz/T}\n\\]\nThus if \\(B=0.32\\) T and \\(n=10^{18}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\), the cyclotron frequency is approximately equal to the plasma frequency for electrons.\nEquation 10.4 tells us that if a plasma oscillation is to occur at all, it must have a frequency depending only on \\(n\\). In particular, \\(\\omega\\) does not depend on \\(k\\), so the group velocity \\(\\mathrm{d}\\omega/dk\\) is zero. The disturbance does not propagate. How this can happen can be made clear with a mechanical analogy (Fig. 4.3 fig-independent-springs). Imagine a number of heavy balls suspended by springs equally spaced in a line. If all the springs are identical, each ball will oscillate vertically with the same frequency. If the balls are started in the proper phases relative to one another, they can be made to form a wave propagating in either direction. The frequency will be fixed by the springs, but the wavelength can be chosen arbitrarily. The two undisturbed balls at the ends will not be affected, and the initial disturbance does not propagate. Either traveling waves or standing waves can be created, as in the case of a stretched rope. Waves on a rope, however, must propagate because each segment is connected to neighboring segments.\nFIGURE: Synthesis of a wave from an assembly of independent oscillators.\nThis analogy is not quite accurate, because plasma oscillations have motions in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) rather than transverse to \\(\\mathbf{k}\\). However, as long as electrons do not collide with ions or with each other, they can still be pictured as independent oscillators moving horizontally (in fig-independent-springs). But what about the electric field? Won’t that extend past the region of initial disturbance and set neighboring layers of plasma into oscillation? In our simple example, it will not, because the electric field due to equal numbers of positive and negative infinite plane charge sheets is zero. In any finite system, however, plasma oscillations will propagate. In Fig. 4.4 ADD IT!, the positive and negative (shaded) regions of a plane plasma oscillation are confined in a cylindrical tube. The fringing electric field causes a coupling of the disturbance to adjacent layers, and the oscillation does not stay localized.",

    "text": "10.6 ES vs. EM Waves\nA practical way to distinguish ES and EM waves is to check \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field of the wave: * If the curvature is relatively small and the divergence is relatively large, then it is likely to be ES. * Otherwise it is likely to be EM.\nAs we will see in Section 10.7, the dielectric function is defined in Equation 10.7. From other perspectives, the dielectric function shows up in the Ampère’s law as well as the Poisson’s equation \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=\\mu_0\\mathbf{j}+\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}&\\equiv\\mu_0\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{\\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_1}) + q_j n_j \\equiv\\nabla\\cdot(\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1) &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet us consider waves in an isotropic plasma. For isotropic plasmas, the dielectric tensor \\(\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\) shrinks to a scalar \\(\\epsilon\\). For cold plasma (static ion background), the dielectric function is \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2}\n\\]\nFor electrostatic (ES) waves, let \\(\\epsilon=0\\), we have \\[\n\\omega=\\pm\\omega_{pe}\n\\]\nFor electromagnetic (EM) waves, from Maxwell’s equations we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}&=-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}, \\\\\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}&=\\mu_0\\mathbf{j}+\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}\\equiv\\mu_0\\epsilon\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWith \\(\\nabla\\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k},\\ \\partial/\\partial t\\rightarrow -i\\omega\\), we can get the dispersion relation \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E}&=i\\omega \\mathbf{B} \\\\\ni\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{B}&=-i\\mu_0\\epsilon\\omega\\mathbf{E} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow k^2\\mathbf{E}-\\cancel{(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{E})\\mathbf{k}}&=\\omega^2 \\mu_0\\epsilon \\mathbf{E}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{k}\\perp\\mathbf{E}\\), by substituting the dielectric function inside we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nk^2=\\omega^2 \\epsilon\\mu_0=\\omega^2\\epsilon_0\\mu_0\\Big[ 1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big] \\nonumber \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\omega^2=k^2c^2+{\\omega_{pe}}^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor both waves, \\(\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon\\mathbf{E}_1)=0\\Rightarrow i\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1)=0\\) is always valid. However, for electrostatic wave, \\(\\mathbf{E}_1=-\\nabla\\phi_1=-i\\mathbf{k}\\phi_1\\Rightarrow \\mathbf{k}\\parallel \\mathbf{E}_1\\Rightarrow \\epsilon=0\\), while for EM wave, usually \\(\\mathbf{k}\\perp\\mathbf{E}_1\\) (\\(\\mathbf{k}\\perp\\mathbf{E}_1 \\Rightarrow\\) EM wave, but EM waves do not necessarily need to be transverse. You can always add a component of \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) parallel to \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) without changing \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\)), \\(\\epsilon\\) does not need to be zero. Therefore, getting the dispersion relation by setting \\(\\epsilon\\) to 0 is only valid for isotropic ES waves. For EM waves, there’s a systematic way to get all the dispersion relations starting from dielectric function, explained in detail in Section 10.7. Here we just have a simple summary of the steps.\nFrom Maxwell’s equation for the perturbed field, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1 &= -\\mu_0\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{H}_1}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{H}_1 &= \\mathbf{J}_1 +\\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}_1}{\\partial t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where we have assumed \\[\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{E}_1(\\mathbf{x},t) \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_1(\\mathbf{x},t)\n\\end{Bmatrix}  = \\Re\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}_1}e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}-i\\omega t} \\\\\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}_1}e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}-i\\omega t}\n\\end{Bmatrix}\n\\]\nIt quickly follows that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E}_1 &= \\mu_0 \\omega \\mathbf{H}_1 \\\\\ni\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{H}_1 &= i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\Big( \\frac{\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E}_1}{\\mu_0 \\omega}\\Big) = \\mathbf{J}_1 - \\epsilon_0 i\\omega\\mathbf{E}_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen there comes the wave equation \\[\n\\mathbf{k}\\times(\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E}_1) = \\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1) - k^2\\mathbf{E}_1 =  -i\\omega \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_1 -\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\mathbf{E}_1 \\equiv -\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}\\mathbf{E}_1\n\\]\nIf we can express the total current density as a function of perturbed electric field, \\(\\mathbf{J}_1 = \\mathbf{J}_1(\\mathbf{E}_1)\\), from MHD, 2-fluid, or Vlasov model combining with the property of the media, we can obtain the expression for the dielectric function \\(\\epsilon\\). With some effort, we get \\[\n\\mathbf{A}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nE_{1x} \\\\ E_{1y} \\\\ E_{1z}\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n\\] from which the condition for non-trivial solutions leads to \\[\n\\det{A} = 0 \\Rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{eigenvalue for } \\omega = \\omega(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\\n\\text{eigenvectors} \\Rightarrow \\text{polarization of E field}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]",

    "section": "10.7 Cold Uniform Plasma",
    "text": "10.7 Cold Uniform Plasma\nAs long as \\(T_e = T_i = 0\\), the linear plasma waves can easily be generalized to an arbitrary number of charged particle species and an arbitrary angle of propagation \\(\\theta\\) relative to the magnetic field. Waves that depend on finite \\(T\\), such as ion acoustic waves, are not included in this treatment. The derivations go back to late 1920s when Appleton and Wilhelm Altar first calculated the cold plasma dispersion relation (CPDR).\nFirst, we define the dielectric tensor of a plasma as follows. The fourth Maxwell equation is \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0(\\mathbf{j} + \\epsilon_0\\dot{\\mathbf{E}})\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) is the plasma current due to the motion of the various charged particle species \\(s\\), with density \\(n_s\\), charge \\(q_s\\), and velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_s\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{j} = \\sum_s n_s q_s\\mathbf{v}_s\n\\tag{10.5}\\]\nConsidering the plasma to be a dielectric with internal currents \\(\\mathbf{j}\\), we may write Equation 10.5 as \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\dot{\\mathbf{D}}\n\\] where \\[\n\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{i}{\\omega}\\mathbf{j}\n\\tag{10.6}\\] is the electric displacement field or electric induction. It accounts for the effects of bound charge within materials (i.e. plasma). Here we have assumed an \\(\\exp(-i\\omega t)\\) dependence for all plasma motions. Let the current \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) be proportional to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) but not necessarily in the same direction (because of the magnetic field \\(B_0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\)); we may then define a conductivity tensor \\(\\pmb{\\sigma}\\) by the relation \\[\n\\mathbf{j} = \\pmb{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nEquation 10.6 becomes \\[\n\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon\\Big( \\mathbf{I} + \\frac{i}{\\epsilon_0\\omega}\\pmb{\\sigma} \\Big)\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\pmb{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\n\\tag{10.7}\\]\nThus the effective dielectric constant of the plasma is the tensor \\[\n\\pmb{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon_0 (\\mathbf{I} + i\\pmb{\\sigma}/\\epsilon_0\\omega)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the unit tensor. In electromagnetism, a dielectric is an electrical insulator that can be polarised by an applied electric field. When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor, because they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material, but instead they shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, causing dielectric polarisation.\nTo evaluate \\(\\pmb{\\sigma}\\), we use the linearized fluid equation of motion for species \\(s\\), neglecting the collision and pressure terms: \\[\nm_s\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_s}{\\partial t} = q_s(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}_s\\times\\mathbf{B}_0)\n\\tag{10.8}\\]\nDefining the cyclotron and plasma frequencies for each species as \\[\n\\omega_{cs}\\equiv\\bigg\\lvert\\frac{q_s B_0}{m_s}\\bigg\\rvert, \\quad \\omega_{ps}^2\\equiv\\bigg\\lvert\\frac{n_0 q_s^2}{\\epsilon_0m_s}\\bigg\\rvert\n\\]\nWe can separate Equation 10.8 into x, y, and z components and solve for \\(\\mathbf{v}_s\\), obtaining \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{xs} &= \\frac{iq_s}{m_s\\omega} \\frac{E_x\\pm i(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)E_y}{1-(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)^2} \\\\\nv_{ys} &= \\frac{iq_s}{m_s\\omega} \\frac{E_y\\mp i(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)E_x}{1-(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)^2} \\\\\nv_{zs} &= \\frac{iq_s}{m_s\\omega} E_z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.9}\\] where \\(\\pm\\) stands for the sign of \\(q_s\\). The plasma current is \\[\n\\mathbf{j} = \\sum_s n_{0s}q_s\\mathbf{v}_s\n\\] so that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{i}{\\epsilon_0\\omega}j_x &= \\sum_s \\frac{in_{0s}}{\\epsilon_0 \\omega}\\frac{iq_s^2}{m_s\\omega}\\frac{E_x\\pm i(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)E_y}{1-(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)} \\\\\n&=\\sum_s -\\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\\frac{E_x\\pm i(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)E_y}{1-(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.10}\\]\nUsing the identities \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{1-(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)^2} &= \\frac{1}{2}\\Big[ \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} \\Big] \\\\\n\\pm\\frac{\\omega_{cs}/\\omega}{1-(\\omega_{cs}/\\omega)^2} &= \\frac{1}{2}\\Big[ \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} \\Big],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwe can write Equation 10.10 as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0\\omega}j_x &= -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big[ \\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} \\Big)E_x \\\\\n&+ \\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} \\Big)iE_y \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.11}\\]\nSimilarly, the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) components are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0\\omega}j_y &= -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big[ \\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} \\Big)iE_x \\\\\n&+ \\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} \\Big)E_y \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.12}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{i}{\\epsilon_0\\omega}j_z = -\\sum_s\\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}E_z\n\\tag{10.13}\\]\nUse of Equation 10.11 in Equation 10.6 gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}D_x &= E_x -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big[ \\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} )E_x \\\\\n&+ \\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} )iE_y \\Big] \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.14}\\]\nWe define the convenient abbreviations \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR &\\equiv 1 - \\sum_s\\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\pm\\omega_{cs}} \\Big)\\\\\nL &\\equiv 1 - \\sum_s\\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega\\mp\\omega_{cs}} \\Big)\\\\\nS &\\equiv \\frac{1}{2}(R+L)\\quad D\\equiv \\frac{1}{2}(R-L)^\\ast \\\\\nP &\\equiv 1-\\sum_s\\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.15}\\]\nwhere “R” stands for right, “L” stands for left, “S” stands for sum, “D” stands for difference, and “P” stands for plasma. Do not confuse D with the electric displacement field \\(\\mathbf{D}\\). Using these in Equation 10.14 and proceeding similarly with the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) components, we obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon_0^{-1}D_x &= SE_x -iDE_y \\\\\n\\epsilon_0^{-1}D_y &= iDE_x + SE_y \\\\\n\\epsilon_0^{-1}D_z &= PE_z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nComparing with Equation 10.7, we see that \\[\n\\pmb{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon_0\\begin{pmatrix}\nS & -iD & 0 \\\\\niD & S & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & P\n\\end{pmatrix} \\equiv \\epsilon_0\\pmb{\\epsilon}_R\n\\tag{10.16}\\]\nWe next derive the wave equation by taking the curl of the equation \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = -\\dot{\\mathbf{B}}\\) and substituting \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=\\mu_0\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}\\), obtaining \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = -\\mu_0\\epsilon_0( \\pmb{\\epsilon}_R \\cdot\\ddot{\\mathbf{E}} ) = -\\frac{1}{c^2}\\pmb{\\epsilon}_R\\cdot\\ddot{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\tag{10.17}\\]\nAssuming an \\(\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})\\) spatial dependence of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and defining a vector index of refraction \\[\n\\mathbf{n}=\\frac{c}{\\omega}\\mathbf{k}\n\\]\nWe can write Equation 10.17 as \\[\n\\mathbf{n}\\times(\\mathbf{n}\\times\\mathbf{E})+\\pmb{\\epsilon}_R\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = 0\n\\tag{10.18}\\]\nThe uniform plasma is isotropic in the \\(x-y\\) plane, so we may choose the \\(y\\) axis so that \\(k_y = 0\\), without loss of generality. If \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\), we then have \\[\nn_x = n\\sin\\theta\\quad n_z=n\\cos\\theta\\quad n_y = 0\n\\]\nThe next step is to separate Equation 10.18 into components, using the elements of \\(\\pmb{\\epsilon}_R\\) given in Equation 10.16. This procedure readily yields \\[\n\\mathbf{R}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}\nS - n^2\\cos\\theta & -iD & n^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\\\\niD & S-n^2 & 0 \\\\\nn^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta & 0 & P-n^2\\sin^2\\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nE_x \\\\ E_y \\\\ E_z\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n\\tag{10.19}\\]\nFrom this it is clear that the \\(E_x\\), \\(E_y\\) components are coupled to \\(E_z\\) only if one deviates from the principal angles \\(\\theta = 0, 90^\\circ\\).\nEquation 10.19 is a set of three simultaneous, homogeneous equations; the condition for the existence of a solution is that the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) vanish: \\(||\\mathbf{R}||=0\\). We then obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(iD)^2&(P-n^2\\sin^2\\theta) + (S - n^2)  \\\\\n&\\times [(S-n^2\\cos^2\\theta)(P-n^2\\sin^2\\theta)-n^4\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta] = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.20}\\]\nBy replacing \\(\\cos^2\\theta\\) by \\(1-\\sin^2\\theta\\), we can solve for \\(\\sin^2\\theta\\), obtaining \\[\n\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{-P(n^4-2Sn^2+RL)}{n^4(S-P)+n^2(PS-RL)}\n\\]\nWe have used the identity \\(S^2 -  D^2 = RL\\). Similarly, \\[\n\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{Sn^4 - (PS + RL)n^2 + PRL}{n^4(S-P)+n^2(PS-RL)}\n\\]\nDividing the last two equations, we obtain \\[\n\\tan^2\\theta = \\frac{-P(n^4-2Sn^2+RL)}{Sn^4-(PS+RL)n^2+PRL}\n\\]\nSince \\(2S = R + L\\), the numerator and denominator can be factored to give the cold-plasma dispersion relation \\[\n\\tan^2\\theta = \\frac{-P(n^2-R)(n^2-L)}{(Sn^2-RL)(n^2-P)}\n\\tag{10.21}\\]\n\n10.7.1 Wave Modes\nThe principal modes of cold plasma waves can be recovered by setting \\(\\theta = 0^0\\) and \\(90^\\circ\\). When \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\), \\[\nP(n^2-R)(n^2-L) = 0\n\\]\nThere are three roots:\n\n\\(P=0\\) (Langmuir wave)\n\\(n^2=R\\) (R wave)\n\\(n^2=L\\) (L wave)\n\nWhen \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), \\[\n(Sn^2-RL)(n^2-P) = 0\n\\]\nThere are two roots:\n\n\\(n^2=RL/S\\) (extraordinary wave)\n\\(n^2=P\\) (ordinary wave)\n\nBy inserting the definitions of Equation 10.15, one can verify that these are identical to the dispersion relations given in separate derivations, with the addition of corrections due to ion motions.\n\n\n10.7.2 Resonances\nThe resonances can be found by letting \\(n\\) go to \\(\\infty\\). We then have \\[\n\\tan^2\\theta_{res} = -P/S\n\\]\nThis shows that the resonance frequencies depend on angle \\(\\theta\\).\n\nIf \\(\\theta=0^\\circ\\), the possible solutions are \\(P = 0\\) and \\(S = \\infty\\). The former is the plasma resonance \\(\\omega=\\omega_p\\), while the latter occurs when either \\(R = \\infty\\) (i.e. \\(\\omega=\\omega_{ce}\\), electron cyclotron resonance) or \\(L =\\infty\\) (i.e. \\(\\omega=\\omega_{ci}\\), ion cyclotron resonance).\nIf \\(θ = 90^\\circ\\), the possible solutions are \\(P =\\infty\\) or \\(S = 0\\). The former cannot occur for finite \\(\\omega_p\\) and \\(\\omega\\), and the latter yields the upper and lower hybrid frequencies, as well as the two-ion hybrid frequency when there is more than one ion species.\n\n\n\n10.7.3 Cutoffs\nThe cutoffs can be found by setting \\(n = 0\\) in Equation 10.21. Again using \\(S^2-D^2 = RL\\), we find that the condition for cutoff is independent of \\(\\theta\\): \\[\nPRL = 0\n\\]\n\nThe conditions \\(R = 0\\) and \\(L = 0\\) yield the \\(\\omega_R\\) and \\(\\omega_L\\) cutoff frequencies, with the addition of ion corrections.\n\nFor R-waves, since \\(\\omega_{pi}^2\\ll\\omega_{pe}^2,\\omega_{ci}\\ll\\omega_{ce}\\), the cutoff frequency can be approximated by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1-\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega(\\omega+\\omega_{ci})} = 0 \\\\\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2\\Big[ \\omega\\Big(1+\\cancel{\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}}\\Big)+\\omega_{ci}-\\cancel{\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}}\\omega_{ce}\\Big]}{\\omega_{ce}\\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})\\Big( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{ce}}+\\cancel{\\frac{\\omega_{ci}}{\\omega_{ce}}}\\Big)} \\\\\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(\\omega+\\omega_{ci})}{\\omega^2(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})} \\\\\n\\omega^3 - \\omega_{ce}\\omega^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2\\omega - \\omega_{pe}^2\\omega_{ci} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere somehow we can ignore \\(\\omega_{pe}^2\\omega_{ci}\\) (I DON’T KNOW WHY???) and obtain the positive solution \\[\n\\omega_{R=0} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{ce}}{2}\\Big[ 1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega_{ce}^2}\\Big]\n\\tag{10.22}\\]\nIn the low density limit, \\(\\omega_p\\ll\\omega_c\\), \\((1+x)^{1/2}\\approx 1+x/2\\) when \\(x\\rightarrow 0\\), \\[\n\\omega_{R=0} \\approx \\omega_{ce}(1+\\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega_{ce}^2)\n\\]\nIn the high density limit, \\(\\omega_p\\gg\\omega_c\\), \\[\n\\omega_{R=0} \\approx \\omega_{pe} + \\omega_{ce}/2\n\\]\nSimilarly for L-waves, the cutoff frequency can be approximated by \\[\n\\omega_{L=0} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{ce}}{2}\\Big[ -1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega_{ce}^2}\\Big]\n\\tag{10.23}\\]\nIn the low density limit, \\(\\omega_p\\ll\\omega_c\\), \\[\n\\omega_{L=0} \\approx \\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega_{ce}\n\\]\nIn the high density limit, \\(\\omega_p\\gg\\omega_c\\), \\[\n\\omega_{L=0} \\approx \\omega_{pe} - \\omega_{ce}/2\n\\]\n\nThe condition \\(P = 0\\) is seen to correspond to cutoff as well as to resonance. This degeneracy is due to our neglect of thermal motions. Actually, \\(P = 0\\) (or \\(\\omega = \\omega_p\\)) is a resonance for longitudinal waves and a cutoff for transverse waves.\n\n\n\n10.7.4 Polarizations\nThe information contained in Equation 10.21 is summarized in the Clemmow–Mullaly–Allis (CMA) diagram. One further result, not in the diagram, can be obtained easily from this formulation. The middle line of Equation 10.19 reads \\[\niDE_x + (S-n^2)E_y = 0\n\\]\nThus the polarization in the plane perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) is given by \\[\n\\frac{iE_x}{E_y} = \\frac{n^2 - S}{D}\n\\]\nFrom this it is easily seen that waves are linearly polarized at resonance (\\(n^2=\\infty\\)) and circularly polarized at cutoff (\\(n^2 = 0\\), \\(R = 0\\) or \\(L = 0\\); thus \\(S = \\pm D\\)).\n\n\n10.7.5 Low Frequency Limit\nIt is very useful to obtain the circularly polarized wave dispersion relation in the low frequency regime.\nThe R-wave corresponds to electron. When \\(\\omega\\ll\\omega_{ce}\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn^2 = R = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega(\\omega+\\omega_{ci})} - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})} \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} = 1+\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega\\omega_{ce}}-\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega\\omega_{ci}}\\frac{\\omega_{ci}}{\\omega_{ci}+\\omega} \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} = 1+\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega\\omega_{ci}}-\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega\\omega_{ci}}\\frac{1}{1+\\omega/\\omega_{ci}} \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} = 1+\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega\\omega_{ci}}\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\omega/\\omega_{ci}}\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} = 1+\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_{ci}^2}\\frac{1}{1+\\omega/\\omega_{ci}} \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} = 1+\\frac{c^2}{V_A^2}\\frac{1}{1+\\omega/\\omega_{ci}} \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} \\simeq \\frac{c^2}{V_A^2}\\frac{1}{1+\\omega/\\omega_{ci}} \\\\\n\\frac{k_\\parallel^2}{\\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{V_A^2}\\frac{1}{1+\\omega/\\omega_{ci}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.24}\\]\nEquation 10.24 can be arranged into a quasi-quadratic equation for \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=\\omega/k_\\parallel\\) \\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{k_\\parallel^2} = v_A^2 + v_A^2\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{ci}} = v_A^2 + W\\frac{\\omega}{k_\\parallel}\n\\] where we denote \\(W=\\frac{v_A^2 k_\\parallel}{\\omega_{ci}}\\). The solution is then \\[\nv_w = \\frac{W}{2} \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{W^2}{4}+v_A^2}\n\\tag{10.25}\\]\nWhen \\(v_A\\ll W\\), i.e. \\(\\frac{\\omega_{ci}}{k_\\parallel}\\ll v_A\\), we have \\(v_w = W\\).\nFor \\(\\omega_{ci}\\ll\\omega\\ll\\omega_{ce}\\), we can make further simplification: \\[\nk^2c^2 = \\omega^2\\Big(1+\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega\\omega_{ce}} \\Big)\n\\]\nThis is the whistler wave, with group velocity \\(v_g=\\partial\\omega/\\partial k\\propto\\sqrt{\\omega}\\). It means that high frequency waves transpose energy faster than low frequency waves. In other words, one will hear high frequency components earlier than low frequency components, creating a “whistler effect”. This was discovered during the first world war, and the theoretical explanation came out in the 1950s. Also note that since whistler wave travels along the field line, in near-Earth space we have signals traveling from the south hemisphere to the north hemisphere within this frequency regime. Here is an observation example from Palmer station, Antarctica. For \\(\\omega\\ll\\omega_{ci}\\), Alfvén wave is recovered.\nSee more in Section 10.17.\nThe L-wave corresponds to ion. When \\(\\omega&lt;\\omega_{ci}, c\\gg V_A\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{k^2c^2}{\\omega^2} = \\omega^2\\left( 1+\\frac{c^2}{v_A^2}\\frac{\\omega_{ci}}{\\omega_{ci}-\\omega} \\right) \\\\\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2} = V_A^2\\left( 1-\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{ci}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor \\(\\omega\\lesssim\\omega_{ci}\\), we get the ion cyclotron wave; for \\(\\omega\\ll\\omega_{ci}\\), Alfvén wave is recovered.\n?fig-dispersion-parallel shows the dispersion relations for L/R waves in a rough scale (ACTUALLY THE SCALES ARE SO BAD…). Above the cut-off frequencies (\\(\\omega_{R=0}\\) and \\(\\omega_{L=0}\\)) the solution to the wave dispersion equation is called the free-space mode. Below electron and ion cyclotron frequencies the waves are called the cyclotron modes. At low frequencies (\\(\\omega\\rightarrow 0\\)) L- and R-modes merge and the dispersion becomes that of the shear Alfvén wave \\(n^2\\rightarrow c^2/v_A^2\\).\nKeyNotes.plot_dispersion_parallel()\nThe dispersion curve for a R-wave propagating parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field is sketched in Figure 10.2. The continuation of the Alfvén wave above the ion cyclotron frequency is called the electron cyclotron wave, or sometimes the whistler wave. The latter terminology is prevalent in ionospheric and space plasma physics contexts. The phase speed is mostly super-Alfvénic except near the electron gyrofrequency. The wave which propagates above the cutoff frequency, \\(\\omega_1\\), is a standard right-handed circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, somewhat modified by the presence of the plasma. Note that the low-frequency branch of the dispersion curve differs fundamentally from the high-frequency branch, because the former branch corresponds to a wave which can only propagate through the plasma in the presence of an equilibrium magnetic field, whereas the high-frequency branch corresponds to a wave which can propagate in the absence of an equilibrium field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Dispersion relation for a right-handed wave propagating parallel to the magnetic field in a magnetized plasma.\n\n\n\nFor a L-wave, similar considerations to the above give a dispersion curve of the form sketched in Figure 10.3. In this case, \\(n^2\\) goes to infinity at the ion cyclotron frequency, \\(\\Omega_i\\), corresponding to the so-called ion cyclotron resonance (at \\(L\\rightarrow\\infty\\)). At this resonance, the rotating electric field associated with a left-handed wave resonates with the gyromotion of the ions, allowing wave energy to be converted into perpendicular kinetic energy of the ions. There is a band of frequencies, lying above the ion cyclotron frequency, in which the left-handed wave does not propagate. At very high frequencies a propagating mode exists, which is basically a standard left-handed circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, somewhat modified by the presence of the plasma.\nAs before, the lower branch in Figure 10.3 describes a wave that can only propagate in the presence of an equilibrium magnetic field, whereas the upper branch describes a wave that can propagate in the absence an equilibrium field. The continuation of the Alfvén wave to just below the ion cyclotron frequency is generally called the ion cyclotron wave. Note that the phase speed is always sub-Alfvénic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Dispersion relation for a left-handed wave propagating parallel to the magnetic field in a magnetized plasma.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7.6 Faraday Rotation\nA linearly polarized plane wave can be expressed as a sum of left- and right-hand circularly polarized waves (R- and L-modes having equal amplitudes, \\(E_0\\)). If we assume that at \\(z=0\\), the wave is linearly polarized along the \\(x\\)-axis, and that the wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and the background magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) are along the \\(z\\)-axis, we can write \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = E_0 [(e^{ik_Rz}+e^{ik_Lz})\\hat{x} + (e^{ik_Rz}-e^{ik_Lz})\\hat{y}] e^{-i\\omega t}\n\\]\nThe ratio of the \\(E_x\\) and \\(E_y\\) components is \\[\n\\frac{E_x}{E_y} = \\cot\\Big( \\frac{k_L-k_R}{2}z\\Big)\n\\]\nHence, due to different phase speeds of R- and L-modes the linrealy polarized wave that is travelling along a magnetic field will experience the rotation of its plane of polarization. This is called Faraday rotation. The magnitude of the rotation depends on the density and magnetic field of the plasma. Considering frequencies above the plasma frequency one can show that the rate of change in the rotation angle \\(\\phi\\) with the distance travelled (assumed here to be in the \\(z\\)-direction) is \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}z} = \\frac{-e^3}{2m_e^2\\epsilon_0 c\\omega^2}n_e B_0\n\\] and the total rotation from the source to the observer is \\[\n\\phi=\\frac{-e^3}{2m_e^2\\epsilon_0 c\\omega^2}\\int_0^d n_e\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}\n\\] where \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}\\) is along the wave propagation path. The total rotation thus depends on both the dnesity and magnetic field of the medium.\nFaraday rotation is an important diagnostic tool both in laboratories and in astronomy. It can be used to obtain information of the magnetic field of the cosmic plasma. Note that density has to be known using other methods. On the other hand, if the magnetic field is known, Faraday rotation can give information of the density.\n\n\n10.7.7 Perpendicular Wave Propagation\nLet us now consider wave propagation, at arbitrary frequencies, perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field, i.e. \\(\\theta=90^\\circ\\).\nThe cutoff frequencies, at which \\(n^2\\) goes to zero, are the roots of \\(R=0\\) and \\(L=0\\) according to \\(n^2=LR/S\\). In fact, we have already solved these equations in the previous sections (recall that cutoff frequencies do not depend on \\(\\theta\\)). There are two cutoff frequencies, \\(\\omega_{R=0}\\) and \\(\\omega_{L=0}\\), which are specified by Equation 10.22 and Equation 10.23, respectively.\nLet us, next, search for the resonant frequencies, at which \\(n^2\\) goes to infinity. According to the previous discussions, the resonant frequencies are solutions of \\[\nS = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\Omega_e^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\Omega_i^2} = 0\n\\tag{10.26}\\]\nThe roots of this equation can be obtained as follows. First, we note that if the first two terms are equated to zero, we obtain \\(\\omega=\\omega_\\mathrm{UH}\\), where \\[\n\\omega_\\mathrm{UH} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2 + \\Omega_e^2}\n\\tag{10.27}\\]\nIf this frequency is substituted into the third term, the result is far less than unity. We conclude that \\(\\omega_\\mathrm{UH}\\) is a good approximation to one of the roots of Equation 10.26. To obtain the second root, we make use of the fact that the product of the square of the roots is \\[\n\\Omega_e^2\\,\\Omega_i^2 + \\omega_{pe}^2\\,\\Omega_i^2 + \\omega_{pi}^2\\Omega_e^2 \\simeq \\Omega_e^2 \\Omega_i^2 + \\omega_{pi}^2\\,\\Omega_e^2\n\\]\nWe, thus, obtain \\(\\omega= \\omega_\\mathrm{LH}\\), where \\[\n\\omega_\\mathrm{LH} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Omega_e^2\\Omega_i^2 + \\omega_{pi}^2\\Omega_e^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2 + \\Omega_e^2}}\n\\tag{10.28}\\]\nThe first resonant frequency, \\(\\omega_\\mathrm{UH}\\), is greater than the electron cyclotron or plasma frequencies, and is called the upper hybrid frequency. The second resonant frequency, \\(\\omega_\\mathrm{LH}\\), lies between the electron and ion cyclotron frequencies, and is called the lower hybrid frequency. (F. F. Chen 2016) gave some nice explanations of the physical origins of these frequencies by looking at the electrostatic electron/ion waves perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). At low frequencies, the mode in question reverts to the compressional-Alfvén wave discussed previously. Note that the shear-Alfvén wave does not propagate perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nUsing the above information, and the easily demonstrated fact that \\[\n\\omega_\\mathrm{LH} &lt; \\omega_{L=0} &lt; \\omega_\\mathrm{UH} &lt; \\omega_{R=0}\n\\]\nwe can deduce that the dispersion curve for the mode in question takes the form sketched in Figure 10.4. The lowest frequency branch corresponds to the compressional-Alfvén wave. The other two branches constitute the extraordinary, or \\(X\\)-, wave. The upper branch is basically a linearly polarized (in the \\(y\\)-direction) electromagnetic wave, somewhat modified by the presence of the plasma. This branch corresponds to a wave which propagates in the absence of an equilibrium magnetic field. The lowest branch corresponds to a wave which does not propagate in the absence of an equilibrium field. Finally, the middle branch corresponds to a wave which converts into an electrostatic plasma wave in the absence of an equilibrium magnetic field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Dispersion relation for a left-handed wave propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field in a magnetized plasma.\n\n\n\nWave propagation at oblique angles is generally more complicated than propagation parallel or perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field, but does not involve any new physical effects.",

We assume no background flow, \\(\\mathbf{u}_0=0\\), so the current is purely caused by perturbed velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}_1\\).

If we write \\(\\mathbf{V}_A = \\mathbf{B}_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho_0}\\), this can also be written as \\[\n\\omega^2 \\mathbf{v} - {v_s}^2 \\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}) - \\mathbf{k}\\times \\mathbf{k}\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{V}_A) \\times\\mathbf{V}_A = 0\n\\]\nDue to the symmetry in the perpendicular x-y plane, for simplicity, we assume the wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) lies in the x-z plane with an angle w.r.t. the \\(z\\) axis \\(\\theta\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{k} = k_x\\hat{x} + k_z\\hat{z} = k_x\\hat{x} + k_\\parallel\\hat{z} = k\\sin\\theta\\hat{x} + k\\cos\\theta\\hat{z}\n\\]\nNow it can be written as \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\omega^2/k^2 + v_A^2 + v_s^2\\sin^2\\theta & 0 & v_s^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\\\\n0 & -\\omega^2/k^2+v_A^2\\cos^2\\theta & 0 \\\\\nv_s^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta & 0 & -\\omega^2/k^2+v_s^2\\cos^2\\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n\\tag{10.32}\\]\n\n\n10.8.3 Alfvén Wave\nFor any nonzero \\(v_y\\), the \\(y\\)-component of Equation 10.32 gives \\[\n\\omega^2 = k^2v_A^2\\cos^2\\theta = k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2\n\\] which is known as the Alfvén wave, in a uniform plasma immersed in a uniform background magnetic field with phase speed \\[\nv_p = v_A\\cos\\theta\n\\]\nThe group velocity and hence energy propagation is always parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) regardless of the direction of \\(\\mathbf{k}\\), and for this reason this mode is also know as the guided mode. This property, of course, has the direct bearing on the feature of Alfvén wave resonant absorption.\nGiven the velocity perturbation \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 = (0, v_y, 0)\\), \\(-i\\omega\\rho_1 + \\rho_0 \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = 0\\), \\(\\omega\\mathbf{B}_1 + \\mathbf{k}\\times(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0) = 0\\), the other perturbations are given as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_1 &= 0 \\\\\np_1 &= 0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{E} &= -B_0 v_y\\hat{x} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_1 &= \\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{\\omega}\\times\\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{k_zB_0v_y}{\\omega}\\hat{y} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\omega/k_\\parallel}B_0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{j} &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\frac{i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.33}\\]\nSAW has a wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) in the XZ-plane. \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) shall oscillate in the X-direction; \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) shall oscillate in the Y-direction. The electric current of the wave \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) lies in the XZ-plane. The timescale of the variations of the wave fields is much longer than the ion gyroperiod \\(\\Omega_i^{-1}\\). In both the perpendicular and parallel directions, the spatial scale of the waves \\(1/k\\) are much larger than ion motion scale \\(r_{iL}\\). The wave carries a Poynting flux \\(\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1\\) strictly parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\). The ratio of the wave electric field to the wave magnetic field \\(|\\mathbf{E}|/|\\mathbf{B}_1|\\) is exactly one Alfvén speed \\(V_A\\).\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\)) in Equation 10.33 shows that the Alfvén wave in a uniform plasma is a linearly polarized wave if \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 = (0, v_y, 0)\\). If instead we set \\(\\mathbf{k}=(0,0,k)\\) (\\(\\theta=0^\\circ\\)) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_x, v_y, 0)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0\\Rightarrow \\rho_1=0\\) but \\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0 = kv_y\\hat{x} - kv_x\\hat{y}\\) can be a circularly polarized wave or else. Correlated \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) corresponds to waves propagating anti-parallel to the \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) (\\(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0&lt;0\\)), and anti-correlated \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) corresponds to waves propagating parallel to the \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) (\\(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0&gt;0\\)). (This is the same as expressed by the Alfvénicity condition Equation 18.4.) The resultant magnetic field then exhibits shear, thus the Alfvén wave is called the shear Alfvén wave (SAW). An animation of SAW is shown in Figure 10.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Alfvén wave.\n\n\n\nTo understand what happens physically in an Alfvén wave, recall that this is an electromagnetic wave with a fluctuating magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) given by \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1 = -\\dot{\\mathbf{B}}_1\\quad E_x=(\\omega/k)B_y\n\\tag{10.34}\\]\nThe small component \\(B_y\\), when added to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\), gives the magnetic field lines a sinuisoidal ripple, shown exaggerated in Figure 10.6. At the point shown, \\(B_y\\) is in the positive \\(y\\) direction, so, according to Equation 10.34, \\(E_x\\) is in the positive \\(x\\) direction if \\(\\omega/k\\) is in the \\(z\\) direction. The electric field \\(E_x\\) gives the plasma an \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_0\\) drift in the negative \\(y\\) direction. Since we have taken the limit \\(\\omega^2\\ll\\Omega_{c}\\), both ions and electrons will have the same drift \\(v_y\\), obtained from Section 10.7 the component \\(v_y\\) under \\(T_i=0\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{ix} &= \\frac{iq}{m \\omega}\\left( 1-\\frac{\\Omega_c^2}{\\omega^2} \\right)^{-1} E_1 \\\\\nv_{iy} &= \\frac{q}{m\\omega}\\frac{\\Omega_c}{\\omega} \\left( 1-\\frac{\\Omega_c^2}{\\omega^2} \\right)^{-1} E_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.35}\\]\nThus, the fluid moves up and down in the y direction. The magnitude of this velocity is \\(|E_x/B_0|\\). Since the ripple in the field is moving by at the phase velocity \\(\\omega/k\\), the magnetic field is also moving downward at the point indicated in Figure 10.6. The downward velocity of the magnetic field lines is \\((\\omega/k)|B_y/B_0|\\), which, according Equation 10.34, is just equal to the fluid velocity \\(|E_x/B_0|\\). Thus, the fluid and the field lines oscillate together as if the particles were stuck to the lines. The magnetic field lines act as if they were mass-loaded strings under tension, and an Alfvén wave can be regarded as the propagating disturbance occurring when the strings are plucked. This concept of plasma frozen to the field lines and moving with them is a useful one for understanding many low-frequency plasma phenomena. It can be shown that this notion is an accurate one as long as there is no electric field along \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Relation among the oscillating quantities in an Alfvén wave and the (exaggerated) distortion of the lines of force.\n\n\n\nIt remains for us to see what sustains the electric field \\(E_x\\) which we presupposed was there. As \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) fluctuates, the ions’ inertia causes them to lag behind the electrons, and there is a polarization drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_p\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\). This drift \\(v_{ix}\\) is given by Equation 10.35 and causes a current \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\) to flow in the \\(x\\) direction. The resulting \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_0\\) force on the fluid is in the \\(y\\) direction and is \\(90^\\circ\\) out of phase with the velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\). This force perpetuates the oscillation in the same way as in any oscillator where the force is out of phase with the velocity. It is, of course, always the ion inertia that causes an overshoot and a sustained oscillation, but in a plasma the momentum is transferred in a complicated way via the electromagnetic forces.\nIn a more realistic geometry for experiments, \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) would be in the radial direction and \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\) in the azimuthal direction. The motion of the plasma is then incompressible. This is the reason the \\(\\nabla p\\) term in the equation of motion could be neglected.\nIn a non-uniform plasma, SAW attains the interesting property of a continuous spectrum. To illustrate this feature, let us consider the simplified slab model of a cold plasma with a non-uniform density, \\(\\rho=\\rho(x)\\), and a uniform \\(\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\\hat{z}\\). Assuming at \\(t=0\\) a localized initial perturbation \\(\\mathbf{B}_{1y}(x,t=0) = \\exp(-x^2/\\Delta x^2)\\), \\(|k_y\\Delta_x|\\ll1\\), and \\(\\partial\\mathbf{B}_{1y}/\\partial t=0\\), the perturbation then evolves according to the following wave equation (Equation 10.31, \\(B_{1z}=0\\) so no coupling between the fast mode and Alfvén mode): \\[\n[\\partial_t^2 + \\omega_A^2(x)]B_{1y}(x,t) = 0\n\\]\nHere \\(\\omega_A^2(x) = k_z^2v_A^2(x)\\) and the solution is \\[\nB_{1y}(x,t) = \\hat{B}_{1y}(x,0)\\cos[\\omega_A(x)t]\n\\tag{10.36}\\]\nEquation 10.36 shows that every point in \\(x\\) oscillates at a different frequency, \\(\\omega_A(x)\\). With a continuously varying \\(\\omega_A(x)\\); the wave frequency, thus, constitutes a continuous spectrum. While the above result is based on a model with a 1D non-uniformity in x, this general feature of SAW continuous spectrum also holds in magnetized plasmas with 2D or 3D non-uniformities. A good example is geomagnetic pulsations in the Earth’s magnetosphere observed by Engebretson shown in Figure 1 of (L. Chen, Zonca, and Lin 2021).\nEquation 10.36 also indicates an unique and important property of SAW continuous spectrum: the spatial structure evolves with time. Specifically, the wave number in the non-uniformity direction is, time asymptotically, given by: \\[\n|k_x| = \\bigg\\lvert\\frac{\\partial \\ln B_{1y}}{\\partial x}\\bigg\\rvert \\simeq \\bigg\\lvert\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\omega_A(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}\\bigg\\rvert t\n\\tag{10.37}\\]\nThat \\(|k_x|\\) increases with \\(t\\) is significant, since it implies that any initially long-scale perturbations will evolve into short scales. This point is illustrated in Figure ??? (CAN I PERFORM THE SIMULATION?); showing the evolution of a smooth \\(B_{1y}\\) at \\(t=0\\) to a spatially fast varying \\(B_{1y}\\) at a later \\(t\\).\nAnother consequence of \\(|k_x|\\) increasing with \\(t\\) is the temporal decay of \\(B_{1x}\\). From \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1 \\simeq \\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_{1\\perp}=0\\), we can readily derive that, for \\(|\\omega_A^\\prime t|\\gg |k_y|\\): \\[\nB_{1x}(x, t)\\simeq \\frac{k_y}{\\omega_A^\\prime(x)t}\\hat{B}_{1y}(x,0)e^{-i\\omega_A(x)t}\\Big[ 1+\\mathcal{O}\\Big( \\frac{k_y}{|\\omega_A^\\prime t|+ ...} \\Big) \\Big]\n\\]\nThat is, \\(B_{1x}\\) decays temporally due to the phase mixing of increasingly more rapidly varying neighboring perturbations.\nNoting that, as \\(t\\rightarrow\\infty\\), \\(|k_x|\\rightarrow\\infty\\), it thus suggests that the perturbation will develop singular structures toward the steady state. As we will see in the field line resonance Chapter 16, the singularity is reached at the Alfvén resonant point \\(x_r\\), where \\(\\omega^2=\\omega_A^2(x_r)\\) along with a finite resonant wave-energy absorption rate. Note that at the isolated extrema of the SAW continuum, \\(|\\omega_A^\\prime|=0\\), phase mixing vanishes; consequently, perturbation remains regular and experiences no damping via resonant absorption. This feature has important implications to Alfvén instabilities in laboratory plasmas.\nSpace plasmas support a variety of waves, but for heating the plasma and accelerating the electrons and ions, Alfvén waves are a predominant source. Near the Sun, Alfvén waves are excited and propagate outward. They exchange their energy with particles to accelerate them in the form of solar wind and heat the electrons. When perpendicular wavelength of the wave becomes comparable to the ion gyro-radius (\\(k_\\perp r_{Li}\\sim 1\\)) or inertial length (\\(k_\\perp d_i \\sim 1\\)) in the case of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs, Section 10.9.4) or inertial Alfvén waves (IAWs, Equation 10.71), respectively, then the wave in both the limits has a nonzero parallel electric field component which is responsible for the acceleration of the particles via the Landau mechanism. This is also consistent with the generalized Ohm’s law Equation 8.27: only when we go beyond Hall MHD can \\(\\mathbf{E}_\\parallel\\) be nonzero. (WHAT ABOUT \\(\\eta\\mathbf{j}\\)?) KAW relates to \\(\\frac{\\nabla P_e}{ne}\\) term, while IAW relates to \\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{j}}{\\partial t}\\) term. The key interest is in \\(E_\\parallel\\). KAWs and IAWs have significance not only in space plasmas but also in laboratory plasma such as in fusion reactors.\nAlfvén wave has very high saturation level, meaning that it takes a long time for the wave to reach the nonlinear phase. (???)\nSAW in a Slab\nWe now look deeper into the properties of Alfvén waves in a nonuniform magnetized plasma slab that carries a current flowing along an externally imposed magnetic field \\(B_{0z}\\hat{z}\\), where \\(B_{0z}\\) is assumed to be a constant. First, we formulate the governing equation for the slab geometry, under the ideal MHD condition. Then we show that Alfvén waves are always neutrally stable, with important indication at the end.\nThe presence of an equilibrium current density \\(\\mathbf{J}_0 = \\widehat{z}J_0(x)\\) produces a local magnetic field of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_0 = \\hat{z}B_{0z} + \\hat{y}B_{0y}(x)\n\\]\nThe Ampère’s law gives \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_0 = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\partial B_{0y}}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial B_{0x}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial B_{0y}}{\\partial x} = \\mu_0 J_0(x)\n\\tag{10.38}\\]\nFrom the force balance equation, \\[\n\\mathbf{J}_0\\times\\mathbf{B}_0 = \\nabla P_0\n\\tag{10.39}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 10.38 into Equation 10.39, we get \\[\n\\frac{{B_{0y}(x)}^2}{2\\mu_0} + P_0(x) = \\text{const.}\n\\]\nDesignate all perturbation quantities with a subscript 1, and assume \\(e^{-i\\omega t+ik_y y+ i k_z z}\\) dependence for all perturbations (nonuniform in the \\(x\\)-direction, thus no sinuisoidal wave assumption). From linearized Faraday’s law and Ohm’s law in ideal MHD,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1 = \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{v}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_0) = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\partial t} \\\\\n-i\\omega\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\mathbf{v}_1\\cancel{(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)}-\\mathbf{B}_0\\cancel{(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_1)}+(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla)\n\\mathbf{v}_1 - (\\mathbf{v}_1\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}_0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where we have assumed the plasma is incompressible. Replace \\(\\nabla\\) with \\(i\\mathbf{k}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_1=i\\omega \\pmb{\\xi}_1\\) and take the \\(x\\)-component, we get \\[\nB_{1x} = i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)\\xi_{1x}\n\\tag{10.40}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{k}=\\hat{y}k_y+\\hat{z}k_z\\).\nThe MHD force law can be linearized to \\[\n\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_1}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\Big( p_1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\\Big) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\big[ (\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}_1 + (\\mathbf{B}_1\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}_0\\big]\n\\tag{10.41}\\]\nSince the plasma is incompressible, \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\pmb{v}_1=0,\\ \\dot{\\pmb{\\xi}}=\\mathbf{v}_1\\Rightarrow \\nabla\\cdot\\pmb{\\xi}=0\\). In addition, \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1=0\\). We then have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\pmb{\\xi}_{1yz}&=i\\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\pmb{B}_{1yz}&=i\\frac{\\partial B_{1x}}{\\partial x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\pmb{\\xi}_{1yz} = (0,\\xi_{1y},\\xi_{1z})\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}_{1yz}=(0,B_{1y},B_{1z})\\). The \\(x\\)-component of Equation 10.41 gives \\[\n-\\rho_0\\omega^2 \\xi_{1x} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big( p_1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\\Big) +\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\big[ (\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla)B_{1x} \\big]\n\\tag{10.42}\\]\nThe dot product of Equation 10.41 with \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\rho_0 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\pmb{\\xi}_{1yz} &= ik^2 \\Big( p_1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\\Big) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\big[ i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_{1yz}) + B_{1x}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)\\big]\\\\\n-\\rho_0 \\omega^2 i\\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x} &= ik^2 \\Big( p_1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\\Big) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\big[ i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)(i\\frac{\\partial B_{1x}}{\\partial x}) + B_{1x}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)\\big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.43}\\]\nFinally, canceling \\(p_1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\\) from Equation 10.42 and Equation 10.43 and substituting \\(B_{1x}\\) from Equation 10.40, we obtain the governing equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big\\{ \\rho_0 \\big[ \\omega^2 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big]\\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\Big\\} -k^2\\rho_0 \\big[ \\omega^2 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big]\\xi_{1x}=0\n\\tag{10.44}\\] where \\(k^2={k_y}^2+ {k_z}^2\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_A = v_A \\mathbf{B}_0/B_0\\), and \\(v_A=B_0/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho_0}\\) is the local Alfvén speed. This is the governing equation of shear Alfvén waves in a slab geometry derived by Hasegawa and Liu Chen in the 1970s, which is readily compared with Eq.(10.33) in (Bellan 2008).\nIt is easy to show that this governing equation always yields neutrally stable solutions of SAWs, i.e. \\(\\omega_i=\\Im(\\omega)=0\\). Multiply it by \\(\\xi_{1x}^\\ast\\), and integrate the resultant equation to get \\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}x \\rho_0 \\big[ \\omega^2-(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big] \\Big[ \\bigg\\lvert \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\xi_{1x}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\bigg\\rvert^2 + k^2\\lvert\\xi_{1x}\\rvert^2 \\Big] = 0\n\\] where we have assumed that \\(\\xi_{1x}\\) vanishes on the boundary. This gives \\[\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}x \\rho_0 (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\Big[ \\bigg\\lvert \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\xi_{1x}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\bigg\\rvert^2 + k^2\\lvert \\xi_{1x}\\rvert^2 \\Big]}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\rho_0[ \\lvert \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\xi_{1x}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\rvert^2 + k^2\\lvert \\xi_{1x}\\rvert^2]\\mathrm{d}x} \\ge 0\n\\]\nSAWs are the dominant low frequency waves in a current carrying plasma. The neutrally stable modes studies above can be destabilized by unfavorable curvature, and such modes are called ballooning modes (Section 13.7.4). They may also be destabilized by a finite electrical resistivity, and these are tearing modes (Section 13.7.5). Their interaction with fusion-generated alpha particles are a major issue in all magnetic fusion schemes. Finally, since the governing equation exhibits a singularity when \\(\\omega=\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A\\), this singularity represents resonance absorption, which forms the basis of Alfvén wave heating (i.e. field line resonance, Chapter 16). This singularity also give rise to the so called “Alfvén continuum spectrum” mentioned above.\nNote that the governing equation is valid even if \\(B_{0z}\\) is an arbitrary function of \\(x\\). If in addition, an external gravity \\(\\mathbf{g}=\\hat{x}g\\) in the x-direction is present, the governing equation is modified simply by inserting the term \\(-(g/\\rho_0)\\mathrm{d}\\rho_0/\\mathrm{d}x\\) in the second square bracket, and the equation is identical to Eq.(10.33) of Bellan. This is the most general equation which describes the magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRT) in Cartesian geometry using the incompressible, ideal MHD model.\n\n\n10.8.4 Fast and Slow Wave\nThe \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) components of Equation 10.32 give \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\omega^2-k^2{v_A}^2-{k_x}^2{v_s}^2)v_x -k_x k_z{v_x}^2v_z = 0 \\\\\n(\\omega^2-{k_z}^2{v_s}^2)v_z -k_x k_z{v_s}^2v_x=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe dispersion relation is given by the determinant being 0, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega^4-k^2({v_A}^2+{v_s}^2)\\omega^2+{k_z}^2{v_s}^2k^2{v_A}^2=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2}=\\frac{1}{2}({v_A}^2+{v_s}^2)\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{({v_A}^2+{v_s}^2)^2-4{v_s}^2{v_A}^2\\cos^2\\theta}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.45}\\]\n“+” corresponds to the fast mode, or magnetosonic mode, and “-” corresponds to the slow mode. The Friedrich graph Figure 10.7 is very useful in interpreting Equation 10.45. Here we only show the case for \\(v_A&gt;v_s\\); if \\(v_A&lt;v_S\\), then along the background magnetic field direction \\(\\hat{z}\\) the fast wave will have a phase speed \\(v_\\mathrm{ph} = v_s\\), and the slow wave will a phase speed \\(v_\\mathrm{ph} = v_A\\) that overlaps with the Alfvén wave. Thus in the high-\\(\\beta\\) case slow wave may have a faster phase speed than the Alfvén wave at a proper angle!\nAnother thing to be careful about is that when you observe a wave propagating at the Alfvén speed along the field line, you need more information to determine the characteristics of the wave:\n\nCheck the \\(\\beta\\)-regime as well as the compressionality to determine if it has fast/slow wave component.\nCheck the polarization to see if it is an cyclotron wave.\nCheck the parallel electric field to see if has kinetic features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Friedrich diagram showing the variation of the phase velocities of the three MHD waves with direction of propagation in the x-z plane when \\(v_A&gt;v_s\\), i.e. low-\\(\\beta\\) case.\n\n\n\nGiven the velocity perturbation \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_x, 0, v_z)\\), the other perturbations are given as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_1 &= \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\omega}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} \\\\\np_1 &= \\gamma p_0\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{\\gamma p_0}{\\omega}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} \\\\\n\\mathbf{E} &= B_0 v_x\\hat{y} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_1 &= \\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{\\omega}\\times\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{B}_0 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)\\mathbf{v}}{\\omega} = -\\frac{B_0 v_x k_z}{\\omega}\\hat{x} + \\frac{B_0v_xk_x}{\\omega}\\hat{z} \\\\\n\\mathbf{j} &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\frac{i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.46}\\]\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\) shows that the fast/slow modes in a uniform plasma are also linearly polarized. When we have \\(\\theta=90^\\circ\\) (Figure 10.8), the magnetic perturbation can be simplified to \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\frac{v}{\\omega/k_\\perp}\\mathbf{B}_0\n\\] which means that the perturbed magnetic field is always aligned with the background magnetic field.\nThe distinction between the fast and slow waves can be further understood by comparing the signs of the wave induced fluctuations in the plasma and magnetic pressures: \\(p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}/\\mu_0\\), respectively. It follows from Equation 10.46 that \\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}B_0^2 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{v})}{\\mu_0\\,\\omega}\n\\]\nThe \\(z\\)-component of the perturbed momentum equation yields \\[\n\\omega\\rho_0 v_z = k \\cos\\theta p\n\\]\nCombining the above, we have \\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{v_A^2}{v_s^2}\\left( 1 - \\frac{k^2 v_s^2\\cos^2\\theta}{\\omega^2} \\right) p\n\\tag{10.47}\\]\nHence, \\(p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}/\\mu_0\\) have the same sign if \\(V_\\mathrm{ph}=\\omega/k&gt;v_s \\,\\cos\\theta\\), and the opposite sign if \\(V_\\mathrm{ph}&lt;v_s\\,\\cos\\theta\\). It is straightforward to show that \\(v_+&gt; v_s\\,\\cos\\theta\\), and \\(v_-&lt;v_s\\,\\cos\\theta\\). Thus, we conclude that in the fast magnetosonic wave the pressure and magnetic energy fluctuations reinforce one another, whereas the fluctuations oppose one another in the slow magnetosonic wave.\nThe temperature perturbation, based on the equation of state, can be derived as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_1 &= T - T_0 = \\frac{p_0 + p_1}{(n_0 + n_1)k_B} - \\frac{p_0}{n_0 k_B} \\\\\n&= p_0\\left( 1+\\gamma\\frac{n_1}{n_0} \\right) \\frac{1}{(n_0 + n_1)k_B} - \\frac{p_0}{n_0 k_B} \\\\\n&= p_0\\frac{1}{k_B}\\left[ \\left(1+\\gamma\\frac{n_1}{n_0}\\right)\\frac{1}{n_0 + n_1} - \\frac{1}{n_0} \\right] \\\\\n&= p_0\\frac{1}{k_B}\\left[ \\frac{(\\gamma-1)n_1}{n_0(n_0+n_1)} \\right] \\\\\n&= T_0\\left(\\gamma-1 \\right)\\frac{\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}{\\omega + \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.48}\\]\nEquation 10.48 shows that temperature does not follow the same sinusoidal shape as the perturbed velocity.\nSpecial attention is required for the extreme cases. When \\(\\theta=90^\\circ\\), the fast wave phase speed \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=\\sqrt{v_A^2 + v_s^2}\\) while the slow wave phase speed \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=0\\). Slow waves cannot propagate perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, this is still a valid solution with all the slow mode perturbation properties, and you will see in Section 13.11.2 and Section 14.2 that this is named mirror mode. When \\(\\theta=0^\\circ\\), the fast wave phase speed \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=\\max(v_A, v_s)\\) while the slow wave phase speed \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=\\min(v_A, v_s)\\).\nIt is important to understand the nature of fast and slow waves under the cold plasma limit, i.e. in the low-\\(\\beta\\) regime where \\(v_A\\gg v_s\\) (cold, strong B). If \\(v_s\\rightarrow 0\\), the slow mode ceases to exit (\\(V_\\mathrm{ph}\\rightarrow 0\\)) and the phase speed of the fast mode becomes \\(v_p \\approx v_A\\). This is often called the compressional Alfvén wave, which is actually a fast wave in the low-\\(\\beta\\) limit. If \\(\\beta\\) is low but we still have a finite sound speed, the dispersion relation for the slow wave reduces to \\[\n\\omega \\simeq k\\,v_s\\,\\cos\\theta\n\\]\nThus, in low-\\(\\beta\\) plasmas the slow wave is a sound wave modified by the presence of the magnetic field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: Fast wave.\n\n\n\nSometimes the fast wave dispersion relation is written in alternative ways. Let \\(a=\\omega/(k_\\parallel v_A)=\\omega/(k\\cos\\theta\\,v_A)\\). From Equation 10.45, we have \\[\n\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{a^2\\left( v_s^2/v_A^2 + 1 \\right)-v_s^2/v_A^2}{a^4}\n\\tag{10.49}\\]\nThis expression is useful when considering the wave resonance and mode conversions. For example, Alfvén resonance occurs when \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2\n\\tag{10.50}\\] i.e. \\(a=1\\) under the low frequency approximation. In higher frequency cases, the Alfvén resonance condition is modified as \\[\na = \\frac{1}{\\left( 1-\\omega^2/\\Omega_i^2 \\right)^2}\n\\tag{10.51}\\] because of the finite ion Larmor radius effects. (The Alfvén resonance singularity can be removed by including non‐MHD effects such as electron inertia or ion Larmor radius corrections.)\n\n\n10.8.5 Limitations of the MHD model\nThe MHD model ignores parallel electron dynamics and so has a shear mode dispersion \\(\\omega^2=k_z^2 v_A^2\\) that has no dependence on \\(k_\\perp\\). Some researchers interpret this as a license to allow arbitrarily large \\(k_\\perp\\) in which case a shear mode could be localized to a single field line. However, the two-fluid model of the shear mode does have a dependence on \\(k_\\perp\\) which becomes important when either \\(k_\\perp c/\\omega_{pe}\\) or \\(k_\\perp r_{Ls}\\) become of order unity (whether to use \\(c\\omega_{pe}\\) or \\(r_{Ls}\\) depends on whether \\(\\beta m_i/m_e\\) is small or large compared to unity). Since \\(c\\omega_{pe}\\) and \\(r_{Ls}\\) are typically small lengths, the MHD point of view is acceptable provided the characteristic length of perpendicular localization is much larger than \\(c\\omega_{pe}\\) or \\(r_{Ls}\\).\nMHD also predicts a sound wave which is identical to the ordinary hydrodynamic sound wave of an unmagnetized gas. The perpendicular behavior of this sound wave is consistent with the two-fluid model because both two-fluid and MHD perpendicular motions involve compressional behavior associated with having finite \\(B_{z1}\\). However, the parallel behavior of the MHD sound wave is problematical because \\(E_{z1}\\) is assumed to be identically zero in MHD. According to the two-fluid model, any parallel acceleration requires a parallel electric field. The two-fluid \\(B_{z1}\\) mode is decoupled from the two-fluid \\(E_{z1}\\) mode so that the two-fluid \\(B_{z1}\\) mode is both compressional and has no parallel motion associated with it.\nThe MHD analysis makes no restriction on the electron to ion temperature ratio and predicts that a sound wave would exist for \\(T_e = T_i\\). In contrast, the two-fluid model shows that sound waves can only exist when \\(T_e \\gg T_i\\) because only in this regime is it possible to have \\(k_B T_i /m_i \\ll \\omega^2 / k_z^2 \\ll k_B T_e /m_e\\) and so have inertial behavior for ions and kinetic behavior for electrons.\nVarious paradoxes develop in the MHD treatment of the shear mode but not in the two-fluid description. These paradoxes illustrate the limitations of the MHD description of a plasma and shows that MHD results must be treated with caution for the shear (slow) mode. MHD provides an adequate description of the fast (compressional) mode.",

    "text": "10.9 Two-fluid model of Alfvén modes\nWe now examine the MHD modes from a two-fluid point of view. The two-fluid point of view shows that the shear mode occurs as one of two distinct modes, only one of which can exist for given plasma parameters. Which of these shear modes occurs depends upon the ratio of hydrodynamic pressure to magnetic pressure. This ratio is defined for each species s as \\[\n\\beta_s = \\frac{n k_B T_s}{B^2/\\mu_0}\n\\] The subscript s is not used if electrons and ions have the same temperature. \\(\\beta_i\\) measures the ratio of ion thermal velocity to the Alfvén velocity since \\[\n\\frac{v_{Ti}^2}{v_A^2} = \\frac{k_B T_i/m_i}{B^2/nm_i\\mu_0} = \\beta_i\n\\]\nThus, \\(v_{Ti}\\ll v_A\\) corresponds to \\(\\beta_i\\ll 1\\). Magnetic forces dominate hydrodynamic forces in a low \\(\\beta\\) plasma, whereas in a high \\(\\beta\\) plasma the opposite is true.\nThe ratio of electron thermal velocity to Alfvén velocity is also of interest and is \\[\n\\frac{v_{Te}^2}{v_A^2} = \\frac{k_B T_e/m_e}{B^2/nm_i\\mu_0} = \\frac{m_i}{m_e}\\beta_e\n\\]\nThus, \\(v_{Te}^2\\gg v_A^2\\) when \\(\\beta_e\\gg m_e/m_i\\) and \\(v_{Te}^2\\ll v_A^2\\) when \\(\\beta_e\\ll m_e/m_i\\). Shear Alfvén wave physics is different in the \\(\\beta_e\\gg m_e/m_i\\) and \\(\\beta_e\\ll m_e/m_i\\) regimes which therefore must be investigated separately. MHD ignores this \\(\\beta_e\\) dependence, an oversimplification which leads to the paradoxes.\nBoth Faraday’s law and the pre-Maxwell Ampère’s law (no displacement current) are fundamental to Alfvén wave dynamics. The system of linearized equations thus is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1 = -\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{j}_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.52}\\]\nIf the dependence of \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\) on \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) can be determined, then the combination of Ampère’s law and Faraday’s law provides a complete self-consistent description of the coupled fields \\(\\mathbf{E}_1, \\mathbf{B}_1\\) and hence describes the normal modes. From a mathematical point of view, specifying \\(\\mathbf{j}_1(\\mathbf{E}_1)\\) means that there are as many equations as dependent variables in the pair of Equation 10.52. The relationship between \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) is determined by the Lorentz equation or some generalization thereof (e.g., drift equations, Vlasov equation, fluid equation of motion). The MHD derivation used the polarization drift to give a relationship between \\(j_{1\\perp}\\) and \\(E_{1\\perp}\\) but leaves ambiguous the relationship between \\(j_{1\\parallel}\\) and \\(E_{1\\parallel}\\).\nThe two-fluid equations provide a definite description of the relationship between \\(j_{1\\parallel}\\) and \\(E_{1\\parallel}\\). At frequencies well below the cyclotron frequency, decoupling of modes also occurs in the two-fluid description, and this decoupling is more clearly defined and more symmetric than in MHD. The decoupling in a uniform plasma results because the dependence of \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\) on \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) has the property that \\(j_{1z}\\sim E_{1z}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{j}_{1\\perp}\\sim\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp}\\). Thus, for \\(\\omega\\ll\\omega_{ci}\\) there is a simple linear relation between parallel electric field and parallel current and another distinct simple linear relation between perpendicular electric field and perpendicular current; these two linear relations mean that the tensor relating \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\) to \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) is diagonal (at higher frequencies this is not the case). The decoupling can be seen by supposing that all first order quantities have the dependence \\(\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{x}+ik_z z)\\) where \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp = k_x\\hat{x}+k_y\\hat{y}\\). Mode decoupling can be seen by examining Table 10.1 which lists the electric and magnetic field components:\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Parallel and perpendicular mode decoupling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\) components\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) components\n\n\n\n\n* \\(\\hat{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1\\)\n\\(\\hat{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1\\)\n\n\n\\(\\hat{z}\\times\\hat{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1\\)\n* \\(\\hat{z}\\times\\hat{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1\\)\n\n\n* \\(\\hat{z}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1\\)\n\\(\\hat{z}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the property that \\(j_{1z}\\sim E_{1z}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{j}_{1\\perp}\\sim\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp}\\) the terms starting with an asterisk are decoupled from the rest. Hence, one mode consists of solely interrelationships between the starred terms (this mode is called \\(E_z\\) mode since it has finite \\(E_z\\)) and the other distinct mode consists solely of interrelationships between the non-starred terms (this mode is called the \\(B_z\\) mode since it has finite \\(B_z\\)). Since the modes are decoupled, it is possible to “turn off” the \\(E_z\\) mode when considering the \\(B_z\\) mode and vice versa. If the plasma is non-uniform, the \\(E_z\\) and \\(B_z\\) modes can become coupled.\nThe ideal MHD formalism sidesteps discussion of the \\(E_z\\) mode. Instead, two disconnected assumptions are invoked in ideal MHD, namely\n\nit is assumed that \\(E_{z1} = 0\\) and\nthe parallel current \\(j_{z1}\\) is assumed to arrange itself spontaneously in such a way as to always satisfy \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{j}_1=0\\).\n\nThis pair of assumptions completes the system of equations, but omits the parallel dynamics associated with the \\(E_z\\) mode and instead replaces this dynamics with an assumption that \\(j_{z1}\\) is determined by some unspecified automatic feedback mechanism. In contrast, the two-fluid equations describe how particle dynamics determines the relationship between \\(j_{z1}\\) and \\(E_{z1}\\). Thus, while MHD is both simpler and self-consistent, it omits some vital physics.\nThe two-fluid model is based on the linearized equations of motion \\[\nm_s n \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}_{s1}}{\\partial t} = nq_s\\left( \\mathbf{E}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_{\\sigma 1}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right) - \\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_{s1}\n\\tag{10.53}\\]\nCharge neutrality is assumed so that \\(n_i=n_e=n\\). Also, the pressure terms is \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_{s1} = \\nabla\\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\np_{s\\perp 1} && 0 && 0 \\\\ 0 && p_{s\\perp 1} && 0 \\\\ 0 && 0 && p_{sz1}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\nabla_\\perp p_{s\\perp 1} + \\hat{z}\\frac{\\partial p_{sz1}}{\\partial z}\n\\tag{10.54}\\]\nAssuming \\(\\omega\\ll \\omega_{ci}\\) implies \\(\\omega\\ll \\omega_{ce}\\) also and so perpendicular motion can be described by drift theory for both ions and electrons. However, here the drift approximation is used for the fluid equations, rather than for a single particle. Following the drift method of analysis, the left hand side of Equation 10.53 is neglected to first approximation, resulting in \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_{s1}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\simeq -\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp} + \\nabla_\\perp p_{s\\perp 1}/nq_s\n\\tag{10.55}\\] which may be solved for \\(\\mathbf{u}_{s1}\\) to give \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} - \\frac{\\nabla p_{s\\perp 1}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{nq_s B^2}\n\\tag{10.56}\\]\nThe first term is the single-particle \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift and the second term is called the diamagnetic drift, a fluid effect that does not exist for single-particle motion (Section 8.7). Because \\(\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\) is time-dependent there is also a polarization drift. Recalling that the form of the single-particle polarization drift for electric field only is \\(\\mathbf{v}_p=m\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}_{1\\perp}/qB^2\\) and using \\(\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp}-\\nabla_\\perp p_{s\\perp 1}/nq_s\\) for the fluid model instead of just \\(\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp}\\) for single particles (Equation 10.55) the fluid polarization drift is obtained. Withe the inclusion of this higher order correction, the perpendicular fluid motion becomes \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} - \\frac{\\nabla p_{s\\perp 1}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{nq_s B^2} + \\frac{m_s}{q_s B^2}\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}_{1\\perp} - \\frac{m_s}{n q_s^2 B^2}\\nabla_\\perp \\dot{p}_{s\\sigma 1}\n\\tag{10.57}\\]\nThe last two terms are smaller than the first two terms by the ratio \\(\\omega/\\omega_{cs}\\) and so may be ignored when the electron and ion fluid velocities are considered separately. However, when the perpendicular current, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{j}_{1\\perp} = \\sum n q_s \\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\) is considered, the electron and ion \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift terms cancel so that the polarization terms becomes the leading terms involving the electric field. Because of the mass in the numerator, the ion polarization drift is much larger than the electron polarization drift. Thus, the perpendicular current comes form ion polarization drift and diamagnetic current \\[\n\\mu_0\\mathbf{j}_{\\perp 1} = \\frac{\\mu_0 nm_i\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}_{1\\perp}}{B^2} - \\sum_s \\frac{\\nabla p_{s\\perp 1}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \\frac{1}{v_A^2}\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}_{\\perp 1} - \\frac{\\mu_0\\nabla p_{\\perp 1}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\tag{10.58}\\] where \\(p_{\\perp 1}=\\sum p_{s\\perp 1}\\). The terms involving \\(\\dot{p}_{\\perp 1}\\) has been dropped because it is small by \\(\\omega/\\omega_c\\) compared to the \\(p_{\\perp 1}\\) term.\nThe center of mass perpendicular motions is \\[\n\\mathbf{U}_{\\perp 1} = \\frac{\\sum m_s n \\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}}{\\sum m_s n}\\approx \\mathbf{u}_{i\\perp 1}\n\\]\nAn important issue for the perpendicular motion is whether \\(\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\) is compressible or incompressible. Let us temporarily ignore parallel motion and consider the continuity equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = 0\n\\tag{10.59}\\]\nIf \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}=0\\), the mode does not involve any density perturbation, i.e. \\(n_1=0\\), and is said to be an incompressible mode. On the other hand, if \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\neq 0\\) then there are fluctuations in density and the mode is said to be compressible.\nTo proceed further, consider the vector identity \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{G}) = \\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{G}\n\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is spatially uniform, this identity reduces to \\(\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{G}) = \\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{F}\\) which in turn vanishes if \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is the gradient of a scalar. Taking the divergence of Equation 10.57 and ignoring the polarization terms (they are of order \\(\\omega/\\omega_{ci}\\) and are only important when calculating the current which we are not interested in right now) gives \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = \\frac{1}{B^2}\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1 = \\frac{1}{B}\\hat{z}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1\n\\tag{10.60}\\] to lowest order. Setting \\(\\mathbf{E}_1=-\\nabla\\phi\\) (i.e. assuming that the electric field is electrostatic) would cause the right hand side of Equation 10.60 to vanish, but such an assumption is overly restrictive because all that matters here is the \\(z\\)-component of \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1\\). The \\(z\\)-component of \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1\\) involves only the perpendicular component of the electric field (i.e. only the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components of the electric field) and so the least restrictive assumption for the right hand side of Equation 10.60 to vanish is to have \\(\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp} = -\\nabla_\\perp \\phi\\). Thus, one possibility is to have \\(\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp}=-\\nabla_\\perp \\phi\\) in which case the perpendicular electric field is electrostatic in nature and the mode is incompressible.\nThe other possibility is to have \\(\\hat{z}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1\\neq 0\\). In this case, invoking Faraday’s law reduces Equation 10.60 to \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = -\\frac{1}{B}\\hat{z}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\partial B_{z1}}{\\partial t}\n\\tag{10.61}\\]\nCombining Equation 10.59 and Equation 10.61 and then integrating in time gives \\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n} = \\frac{B_{z1}}{B}\n\\] which shows that compression/rarefaction is associated with having finite \\(B_{z1}\\) (similar to the argument in Equation 14.17).\nIn summary, there are two general kinds of behavior:\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Incompressible and compressible modes from two-fluid theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantity\nShear modes\nCompressible modes\n\n\n\n\n\\(n_1\\)\n0\n\\(\\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\)\n0\n\\(\\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_{1\\perp}\\)\n\\(-\\nabla_\\perp\\phi\\)\n\\(\\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\\(B_{z1}\\)\n0\n\\(\\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 10.58 provides a relationship between the perpendicular electric field and the perpendicular current. A relationship between the parallel electric field and the parallel current is now required. To obtain this, all vectors are decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{E}_1 = \\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}+E_{z1}\\hat{z}, \\nabla=\\nabla_\\perp + \\hat{z}\\partial_z\\) etc. All quantities are assumed to be proportional to \\(f(x,y)\\exp(ik_z z-i\\omega t)\\). Thus, Faraday’s law can be written as \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\times\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1} + \\nabla_\\perp\\times E_{z1}\\hat{z} + \\hat{z}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\times\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1} + B_{z1}\\hat{z} \\right)\n\\] which has a parallel component \\[\n\\hat{z}\\cdot\\nabla_\\perp\\times\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1} = i\\omega B_{z1}\n\\] and a perpendicular component \\[\n\\left( \\nabla_\\perp E_{z1} - ik_z\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1} \\right)\\times\\hat{z} = i\\omega\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\n\\tag{10.62}\\]\nSimilarly Ampère’s law can be decomposed into \\[\n\\hat{z}\\cdot\\nabla_\\perp\\times\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{j}_{z1}\n\\] and \\[\n\\left( \\nabla_\\perp B_{z1} - ik_z\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1} \\right)\\times\\hat{z} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{j}_{\\perp 1}\n\\tag{10.63}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 10.58 into Equation 10.63 gives \\[\n\\left( \\nabla_\\perp B_{z1} - ik_z\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1} \\right)\\times\\hat{z} = \\frac{i\\omega}{v_A^2}\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1} - \\frac{\\mu_0 \\nabla p_1\\times\\hat{z}}{B}\n\\] or, after re-arrangement, \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\left( B_{z1} + \\frac{\\mu_0 p_{\\perp 1}}{B} \\right)\\times\\hat{z} - ik_z\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z} = -\\frac{i\\omega}{v_A^2}\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\n\\tag{10.64}\\]\nThe shear and compressional modes are now considered separately.\n\n10.9.1 Two-fluid shear modes\nAs discussed above these modes have \\(B_{z1}=0, \\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}=-\\nabla_\\perp\\phi_1\\), and \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}=0\\). We first consider the parallel component of the linearized equation of motion, namely \\[\nnm_s\\frac{\\partial u_{sz1}}{\\partial t} = nq_sE_{z1} - \\frac{\\partial p_{s1}}{\\partial z}\n\\tag{10.65}\\] where \\(p_{s1} = \\gamma_s n_{s1} k_B T_s\\) and \\(\\gamma=1\\) if the motion is isothermal and \\(\\gamma_s=3\\) if the motion is adiabatic and the compression is one-dimensional. The isothermal case corresponds to \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\ll k_B T_s/m_s\\) and vice versa for the adiabatic case.\nThe continuity equation is \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(n\\mathbf{u}_{s1}) = 0\n\\]\nBecause the shear mode is incompressible in the perpendicular direction, the continuity equation reduces to \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(n_0 u_{sz1}) = 0\n\\]\nTaking the time derivative of Equation 10.65 gives (isothermal?) \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u_{sz1}}{\\partial t^2} - \\gamma_s\\frac{k_B T_s}{m_s}\\frac{\\partial^2 u_{s z1}}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{q_s}{m_s}\\frac{\\partial E_{z1}}{\\partial t}\n\\tag{10.66}\\] which is similar to electron plasma wave and ion acoustic wave dynamics except it has not been assumed that \\(E_{z1}\\) is electrostatic.\nInvoking the assumption that all quantities are of the form \\(f(x,y)\\exp(ik_z z-i\\omega t)\\) Equation 10.66 can be solved to give \\[\nu_{sz1} = \\frac{i\\omega q_s}{m_s}\\frac{E_{z1}}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_s k_z^2 k_B T_s /m_s}\n\\] and so the relation between parallel current and parallel electric field is \\[\n\\mu_0 j_{z1} = \\frac{i\\omega}{c^2}E_{z1}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_s k_z^2 k_B T_s/m_s}\n\\]\nUsing \\(\\hat{z}\\cdot\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1=\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{B}_1\\times\\hat{z})=\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z})\\) the parallel component of Ampère’s law becomes for the shear wave \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z}) = \\frac{i\\omega}{c^2}E_{z1}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_s k_z^2 k_B T_s/m_s}\n\\tag{10.67}\\]\nIon acoustic wave physics is embedded in Equation 10.67 as well as shear Alfvén physics. The ion acoustic mode can be retrieved by assuming that the electric field is electrostatic in which case \\(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\) vanishes (???Why???). For the special case where the electric field is just in the \\(z\\) direction, and assuming that \\(k_BT_i/m_i\\ll \\omega^2/k_z^2\\ll k_B T_e/m_e\\) the right hand side of Equation 10.67 becomes \\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} - \\frac{1}{k_z^2\\lambda_{De}^2} \\right)E_{z1} = 0\n\\] which gives the ion acoustic wave \\(\\omega^2=k_z^2 k_B T_e/m_i\\) (see (F. F. Chen 2016) and (Bellan 2008) Sec.4.2.1). This shows that the acoustic wave is associated with having finite \\(E_{z1}\\) and also requires \\(T_e\\gg T_i\\) in order to exist.\nReturning to shear waves, we now assume that the electric field is not electrostatic so \\(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\) does not vanish and Equation 10.67 has to be considered in its entirety. For shear waves the character of the parallel current changes depending on whether the wave parallel phase velocity is faster or slower than the electron thermal velocity:\n\nThe \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\gg k_B T_e/m_e\\) case is called the inertial limit while\nThe \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\ll k_B T_e/m_e\\) case is called the kinetic limit.\n\nThe perpendicular component of Faraday’s law is (Equation 10.62) \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp E_{z1}\\times\\hat{z} - ik_z\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z} = i\\omega\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\n\\tag{10.68}\\]\nSubstitution of \\(\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\\) as determined from Equation 10.64 into Equation 10.68 gives \\[\n-\\frac{i\\omega}{v_A^2}\\nabla_\\perp E_{z1}\\times\\hat{z} - ik_z\\left( \\frac{\\mu_0\\nabla p_{\\perp 1}}{B}\\times\\hat{z} - ik_z\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z} \\right)\\times\\hat{z} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{v_A^2}\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\n\\] which may be solved for \\(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\) to give \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2}\\left( -i\\omega\\nabla_\\perp E_{z1}\\times\\hat{z} + ik_zv_A^2\\frac{\\mu_0\\nabla_\\perp p_{\\perp 1}}{B} \\right)\n\\] and \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2}\\left( i\\omega\\nabla_\\perp E_{z1} + ik_zv_A^2\\frac{\\mu_0\\nabla_\\perp p_{\\perp 1}}{B}\\times\\hat{z} \\right)\n\\]\nSubstitution of \\(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z}\\) into Equation 10.67 gives \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2}\\left( \\nabla_\\perp E_{z1} + k_zv_A^2\\frac{\\mu_0\\nabla_\\perp p_{\\perp 1}}{\\omega B}\\times\\hat{z} \\right) \\right) = E_{z1}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2/c^2}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_s k_z^2 k_B T_s/m_s}\n\\]\nHowever, because \\(\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot(\\nabla_\\perp p_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z})=\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla p_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z})=0\\) (divergence of a curl) the term involving pressure vanishes, leaving an equation involving \\(E_{z1}\\) only, namely \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2} \\nabla_\\perp E_{z1}\\right) - E_{z1}\\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2/c^2}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_s k_z^2 k_B T_s/m_s} = 0\n\\tag{10.69}\\]\nThis is the fundamental equation for shear waves. On replacing \\(\\nabla_\\perp\\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\), Equation 10.69 becomes \\[\n\\frac{k_\\perp^2}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2} + \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{c^2}\\frac{1}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_ek_z^2 k_B T_e/m_e} + \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{c^2}\\frac{1}{\\omega^2 - \\gamma_i k_z^2 k_B T_i/m_i} = 0\n\\tag{10.70}\\]\nIn the situation where \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\gg k_B T_e/m_e\\), the second term dominates the third term since \\(\\omega_{pe}^2\\gg\\omega_{pi}^2\\) and so Equation 10.70 can be recast as \\[\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{k_z^2 v_A^2}{1+k_\\perp^2c^2/\\omega_{pe}^2}\n\\tag{10.71}\\] which is called the inertial Alfvén wave (IAW). If \\(k_\\perp^2c^2/\\omega_{pe}^2\\) is not too large, then \\(\\omega/k_z\\) is of the order of the Alfvén velocity and the condition \\(\\omega^2\\gg k_z^2 k_B T_e/m_e\\) corresponds to \\(v_A^2\\gg k_B T_e/m_e\\) or \\[\n\\beta_e = \\frac{nk_B T_e}{B^2/2\\mu_0}\\ll \\frac{m_e}{m_i}\n\\]\nThus, inertial Alfvén wave shear modes exist only in the ultra-low \\(\\beta\\) regime where \\(\\beta_e\\ll m_e/m_i\\).\nIn the situation where \\(k_B T_i/m_i \\ll \\omega^2/k_z^2 \\ll k_B T_e/m_e\\), Equation 10.69 can be recast as \\[\n\\frac{k_\\perp^2}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{c^2}\\frac{1}{k_z^2 k_B T_e/m_e} + \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{c^2}\\frac{1}{\\omega^2} = 0\n\\tag{10.72}\\]\nBecause \\(\\omega^2\\) appears in the respective denominators of two distinct terms, Equation 10.72 is fourth order in \\(\\omega^2\\) and so describes in two distinct modes. Let us suppose that the mode in question is much faster than the acoustic velocity, i.e. \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\gg k_B T_e/m_i\\). In this case the ion term can be dropped and the remaining terms can be re-arranged to give \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_z^2 v_A^2 \\left( 1+\\frac{k_\\perp^2}{v_A^2}\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e}\\frac{c^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} \\right)\n\\]\nThis is called the kinetic Alfvén wave (KAW). Using \\[\nr_{fL}^2 = \\frac{1}{v_A^2}\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e}\\frac{c^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{ci}^2}\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}\n\\tag{10.73}\\] as a fictitious ion Larmor radius calculated using the electron temperature instead of the ion temperature, the KAW dispersion relation can be expressed more succinctly as \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_z^2 v_A^2\\left( 1+k_\\perp^2r_{fL}^2 \\right)\n\\tag{10.74}\\]\nIf \\(k_\\perp^2r_{Ls}^2\\) is not too large, then \\(\\omega/k_z\\) is again of the order of \\(v_A\\) and so the condition \\(\\omega^2\\ll k_z^2k_B T_e/m_e\\) corresponds to having \\(\\beta_e\\gg m_e/m_i\\). The condition \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\gg k_B T_e/m_i\\) which was also assumed corresponds to assuming that \\(\\beta_e\\ll 1\\). Thus, the KAW dispersion relation Equation 10.74 is valid in the regime \\(m_e/m_i\\ll \\beta_e\\ll 1\\).\nLet us now consider the situation where \\(\\omega^2/k_z^2\\ll k_B T_i/m_i, k_B T_e/m_e\\). In this case Equation 10.72 again reduces to \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_z^2 v_A^2\\left( 1+k_\\perp^2r_{fL}^2 \\right)\n\\tag{10.75}\\] but this time \\[\nr_{fL}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{ci}^2}\\frac{k_B (T_e+T_i)}{m_i}\n\\tag{10.76}\\]\nThis situation would describe shear modes in a high \\(\\beta\\) plasma (ion thermal velocity faster than Alfvén velocity).\nTo summarize: the shear mode has \\(B_{z1} = 0, E_{z1} \\neq 0, j_{z1} \\neq 0, E_{\\perp 1} = −\\nabla \\phi_1\\) and exists in the form of the inertial Alfvén wave for \\(\\beta_e \\ll m_e/m_i\\) and in the form of the kinetic Alfvén wave for \\(\\beta_e \\gg m_e/m_i\\). The shear mode involves incompressible perpendicular motion, i.e., \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = i\\mathbf{k}_\\perp \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1} = 0\\), which means that \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\). For example, in Cartesian geometry, this means that if \\(\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\) is in the \\(x\\) direction, then \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\) must be in the \\(y\\) direction while in cylindrical geometry, this means that if \\(\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\) is in the \\(\\theta\\) direction, then \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\) must be in the \\(r\\) direction. The inertial Alfvén wave is known as a cold plasma wave because its dispersion relation does not depend on temperature (such a mode would exist even in the limit of a cold plasma). The kinetic Alfvén wave depends on the plasma having finite temperature and is therefore called a warm plasma wave. The shear mode can be coupled to ion acoustic modes since both shear and ion acoustic modes involve finite \\(E_{\\parallel 1}\\).\n\n\n10.9.2 Two-fluid compressional modes\nThe compressional mode involves assuming that \\(B_{z1}\\) is finite and \\(E_{z1}=0\\). Having \\(E_{z1}=0\\) means that there is no parallel motion and, in particular, implies that \\(j_{z1}=0\\). Thus, for the compressional mode Faraday’s law has the form \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot(\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z}) &= i\\omega B_{z1} \\\\\n-ik_z\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z} &= i\\omega \\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.77}\\]\nUsing Equation 10.77 to substitute for \\(\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp 1}\\) in Equation 10.64 and then solving for \\(\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\\) gives \\[\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1} = \\frac{i\\omega v_A^2}{\\omega^2-k_z^2 v_A^2} \\nabla_\\perp\\left( B_{z1} + \\frac{\\mu_0 p_{\\perp 1}}{B} \\right) \\times\\hat{z}\n\\]\nSince \\[\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp 1}\\times\\hat{z} = -\\frac{i\\omega v_A^2}{\\omega^2-k_z^2 v_A^2} \\nabla_\\perp\\left( B_{z1} + \\frac{\\mu_0 p_{\\perp 1}}{B} \\right)\n\\]\nEquation 10.77 becomes \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\\left( \\frac{v_A^2}{\\omega^2-k_z^2 v_A^2} \\nabla_\\perp\\left( B_{z1} + \\frac{\\mu_0 p_{\\perp 1}}{B} \\right) \\right) + B_{z1} = 0\n\\tag{10.78}\\]\nIf we assume that the perpendicular motion is adiabatic, then \\[\n\\frac{p_{\\perp 1}}{p} = \\gamma\\frac{n_1}{n} = \\gamma\\frac{B_{z1}}{B}\n\\]\nSubstitute for \\(p_{\\perp 1}\\) in Equation 10.78 gives (???) \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\\left( \\frac{v_A^2+c_s^2}{\\omega^2-k_z^2 v_A^2} \\nabla_\\perp B_{z1}\\right) + B_{z1} = 0\n\\tag{10.79}\\] where \\[\nc_s^2 = \\gamma k_B\\frac{T_e + T_i}{m_i}\n\\]\nOn replacing \\(\\nabla_\\perp\\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\), Equation 10.79 becomes the dispersion relation \\[\n\\frac{-k_\\perp^2(v_A^2+c_s^2)}{\\omega^2 - k_z^2v_A^2} + 1 = 0\n\\] or \\[\n\\omega^2 = k^2v_A^2 + k_\\perp^2 c_s^2\n\\] where \\(k^2=k_z^2+k+\\perp^2\\). Since \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}=i\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{s\\perp 1}\\neq 0\\), the perpendicular wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\) is at least partially co-aligned with the perpendicular velocity.\n\n\n10.9.3 Differences betwen the two-fluid and MHD descriptions\nThe two-fluid description shows that the Alfvén mode (finite \\(E_z\\)) appears as either an inertial or a kinetic Alfvén wave depending on the plasma \\(\\beta\\); the MHD description assumes that \\(E_z = 0\\) for this mode and does not distinguish between inertial and kinetic modes. The two-fluid description also shows that finite \\(E_z\\) will give ion acoustic modes in the parallel direction which are decoupled. The MHD description predicts a so-called sound wave which differs from the ion acoustic wave because the MHD sound wave does not have the requirement that \\(T_e \\gg T_i\\); the MHD sound wave is an artifact for parallel propagation in a plasma with low collisionality (if the collisions are sufficiently large, then the plasma would behave like a neutral gas). Then MHD description predicts a coupling between oblique sound waves via a square root relation (Equation 10.45) which does not exist in the two-fluid model.\n\n\n10.9.4 KAW properties\nThe solution of Equation 10.37 exhibits singularities as \\(t\\rightarrow\\infty\\) naturally suggests that the microscopic length-scale physics neglected in the ideal MHD fluid description should be included in the long-time-scale dynamics of SAWs. For low-frequency SAWs, one can readily recognize the relevant perpendicular (to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\)) microscopic scales are either the ion Larmor radius, \\(r_{iL}=v_{ti}/\\omega_{ci}\\) with \\(v_{ti}\\) and \\(\\omega_{ci}\\) being, respectively, the ion thermal speed and ion cyclotron frequency, and/or \\(r_{eL}=v_{te}/\\omega_{ce}\\) with \\(v_{te}\\) being the electron thermal speed. Including the effects of finite \\(r_{iL}\\), \\(r_{eL}\\) and/or \\(T_e\\) in the SAW dynamics then led to the discovery of the so-called kinetic Alfvén wave (KAW) [Hasegawa and Chen].\nIn KAWs, parallel electric field \\(E_\\parallel\\) can be developed and facilitate particle heating, acceleration, and transport, especially for electrons. However, the inverse mechanism is also possible that electrons moving along the magnetic field in the opposite direction, become retarded by this field component and feed their energy into the KAW. For example, Hasegawa [1979] showed that an electron beam moving along an inhomogeneous magnetic field can excite KAWs.\nExcitation of KAWs requires \\(\\beta&lt;1\\). It has been found in the plasma sheet, at the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL), and in the inner magnetosphere.\nKAW differ from SAW because the short wavelength requires a significant \\(E_\\parallel\\) to maintain charge neutrality due to ion density perturbations caused by the ion polarization drift. When \\(v_{te}&gt;v_A\\), the parallel electric field counteracts electron pressure that would push the electrons away from the ion density perturbations. When \\(v_{te}&lt;v_A\\), the electric field must overcome the electron inertia that prevents the electrons from responding rapidly to the ion density perturbations. \\(E_\\parallel\\) associated with small-scale KAWs may efficiently accelerate particles on the magnetic field lines. (Chaston+ 2009) presented observations in the magnetotail from the Cluster spacecraft showing that KAWs radiate outward from the X-line with outward energy fluxes equivalent to that contained in the outstreaming ions. Wave-particle energy exchange between KAWs and plasmas near the dayside magnetopause has been confirmed by MMS observations (Gershman+ 2017).\nWe consider a KAW with a wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) in the XZ-plane, same as in the SAW case. In many aspects, KAW is similar to SAW: \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) shall oscillate in the X-direction; \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) shall oscillate in the Y-direction. The electric current of the wave \\(i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1/\\mu_0\\) is still in the XZ-plane. The timescale of the variations of the wave field of KAW is much longer than the ion gyroperiod. However, unlike SAW, KAW has\n\na perpendicular scale \\(k_\\perp^{-1}\\) that is comparable to the particle kinetic scale \\(r_{iL}\\).\na very oblique wave vector \\(k_\\perp \\gg k_\\parallel\\) so that the wave is not strongly affected by the Landau damping.\n\\(k_\\perp^{-1} \\ll k_\\parallel^{-1}\\). The finite-Larmor-radius effect starts to become important as the perpendicular wavelength is comparable to the ion gyromotion: Ions can not follow the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift in the electric fields of KAW, because they encounter significantly different electric field in the different phases of the gyromotion. Electrons are still frozen-in in the presence of the wave field. The difference in the ion and electron motion in the perpendicular direction introduces charge separation and coupling to the electrostatic mode. Because the wave electric field \\(E_x\\) is mainly parallel to the \\(\\mathbf{k}\\), \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}=i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E}\\) is small and \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\) is relatively large for KAW. Accordingly, the perpendicular wave electric field \\(E_x\\) is mostly electrostatic in KAW.\nBecause of charge separation in KAW, electrons need to move along the magnetic field to preserve the charge neutrality. Associated with the parallel motion of electron, a small wave electric field \\(E_\\parallel\\) is established, the existence of which is a distinct feature of KAW. The parallel motion of electrons creates a field-aligned current \\(j_\\parallel\\) of KAW. From Ampère’s law \\(i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1=\\mu_0 \\mathbf{j}\\), the field-aligned current \\(\\mathbf{j}_z\\) produces a wave magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}_{1y}\\). As a result, KAW is in fact an EM wave. The ratio of the wave electric field to the wave magnetic field is \\(V_A\\sqrt{1+k_x^2 r_{iL}^2}\\) (Stasiewicz et al. 2000). The kinetic correction \\(k_x^2 r_{iL}^2\\) introduces a deviation of the ratio \\(E_x/B_y\\) from one \\(V_A\\) as in the SAWs.\n\nWhile SAW satisfy \\(\\omega=k_\\parallel v_A\\), the dispersion relation of KAW can be written as (Johnson & Cheng, 1997) \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2 \\Big[ \\frac{1}{1-I_0(k_\\perp^2 r_{iL}^2)e^{-k_\\perp^2 r_{iL}^2}} + \\frac{T_e}{T_i} \\Big]k_\\perp^2 r_{iL}^2\n\\tag{10.80}\\] where \\(I_0\\) is the modified Bessel function. Using a Padé approximation \\(I_0(x)e^{-x}\\approx 1/(1+x)\\) when \\(x=k_\\perp^2r_{iL}^2\\sim\\mathcal{O}(1)\\), the relation can be simplified to \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2\\Big[1+\\Big(1+\\frac{T_e}{T_i}k_\\perp^2r_{iL}^2\\Big) \\Big] =  k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2 [1+k_\\perp^2(r_{iL}^2+r_{fL}^2)]\n\\tag{10.81}\\] where \\(r_{fL}=\\sqrt{k_B T_e/m_i}/\\omega_{ci}\\). So we recover the two-fluid dispersion relation of KAW Equation 10.74. We can see from Equation 10.81 that the phase speed for KAW is always larger than \\(v_A\\).\nWhile SAWs do not have ion density perturbations, KAWs do. In compressibility is only required in the perpendicular direction, but not in the parallel direction w.r.t. the magnetic field.\nThe polarizations of KAW can be expressed as \\[\n\\left\\lvert \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{E}_\\perp}{\\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\perp} \\right\\rvert = v_A(1+k_\\perp^2r_{iL}^2)[1+k_\\perp^2(r_{iL}^2+r_{fL}^2)]^{-1/2}\n\\] where \\(\\delta\\mathbf{E}_\\perp \\perp \\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp\\). KAWs are right-hand polarized. The parallel electric field is \\[\n\\left\\lvert \\frac{\\delta E_\\parallel}{\\delta E_\\perp} \\right\\rvert = k_\\parallel k_\\perp\\frac{r_{fL}^2}{1+k_\\perp^2r_{iL}^2}\n\\]\nIt has been shown that KAWs can be generated via magnetic reconnection, mode conversion, and phase mixing.\n(Gurram, Egedal, and Daughton 2021) used a 2D VPIC simulation to show a transition from KAWs to SAWs from the immediate vicinity of the reconnection region to the exhaust. They checked two important quantities we have seen above:\n\nthe transition in wave speeds from super Alfvénic near the X-point to order of the Alfvén speed deeper into the exhaust (\\(\\sim 60 d_i\\) from the X-point);\nthe transition of \\(k_\\perp d_i\\) from larger than unity to smaller than unity.\n\nIt would be very intuitive to compare animations between MHD Alfvén waves and kinetic Alfvén waves. In a typical MHD Alfvén wave, the particles (yellow) move freely along the magnetic field lines (blue). In a kinetic Alfvén wave, some particles become trapped in the weak spots of the wave’s magnetic field and ride along with the wave as it moves through space.\n\n\n\n\nAlmost half a century after the discovery of KAW, (L. Chen, Zonca, and Lin 2021) demonstrated that the proper treatment of this wave requires gyrokinetics (Chapter 15). However, under some circumstances (\\(\\beta\\gg 1\\)?) the two-fluid theory can recover most if not all of the KAW physics. I need to go over the derivations!\nI am not the only person who is confused by so many different names assigned to Alfvén waves. The Alfvén Wave Zoo is a nice review of all the existence names related to Alfvén waves.

    "section": "10.12 Cold Nonuniform Plasma",
    "text": "10.12 Cold Nonuniform Plasma\nWaves and dispersion relations in a uniform plasma is generally nice and easy. However, more interesting and realistic waves shall be found in nonuniform plasmas.\n\n10.12.1 Simple EM Wave\nLet us start off by examining a very simple case. Consider a plane electromagnetic wave, of frequency \\(\\omega\\), propagating along the \\(z\\)-axis in an unmagnetized plasma whose refractive index, \\(n\\), is a function of \\(z\\). We assume that the wave normal is initially aligned along the \\(z\\)-axis, and, furthermore, that the wave starts off polarized in the \\(y\\)-direction. It is easily demonstrated that the wave normal subsequently remains aligned along the \\(z\\)-axis, and also that the polarization state of the wave does not change. Thus, the wave is fully described by \\[\nE_y(z,t) \\equiv E_y(z)\\,\\exp(-i\\omega t)\n\\] and \\[\nB_x(z,t) \\equiv B_x(z)\\,\\exp(-i\\omega t)\n\\]\nIt can easily be shown (???) that \\(E_y(z)\\) and \\(B_x(z)\\) satisfy the differential equations \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E_y}{\\mathrm{d}z^2} + k_0^{~2}\\,n^2\\,E_y = 0\n\\tag{10.82}\\] and \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\,cB_x}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -i\\,k_0\\,n^2\\,E_y\n\\tag{10.83}\\] respectively. Here, \\(k_0=\\omega/c\\) is the wave-number in free space. Of course, the actual wave-number is \\(k=k_0\\,n\\).\nThe solution to Equation 10.82 for the case of a homogeneous plasma, for which \\(n\\) is constant, is straightforward: \\[\nE_y = A\\,e^{\\,i\\,\\phi(z)}\n\\tag{10.84}\\] where \\(A\\) is a constant, and \\[\n\\phi = \\pm k_0\\,n\\,z\n\\tag{10.85}\\]\nThe solution Equation 10.84 represents a wave of constant amplitude, \\(A\\), and phase, \\(\\phi(z)\\). According to Equation 10.85, there are, in fact, two independent waves which can propagate through the plasma. The upper sign corresponds to a wave which propagates in the \\(+z\\)-direction, whereas the lower sign corresponds to a wave which propagates in the \\(-z\\)-direction. Both waves propagate with the constant phase velocity \\(c/n\\).\nIn general, if \\(n=n(z)\\) then the solution of Equation 10.82 does not remotely resemble the wave-like solution Equation 10.84. However, in the limit in which \\(n(z)\\) is a “slowly varying” function of \\(z\\) (exactly how slowly varying is something which will be established later on), we expect to recover wave-like solutions. Let us suppose that \\(n(z)\\) is indeed a “slowly varying” function, and let us try substituting the wave solution Equation 10.84 into Equation 10.82. We obtain \\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\right)^2 = k_0^{~2} n^2 +i\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi} {\\mathrm{d}z^2}\n\\tag{10.86}\\]\nThis is a non-linear differential equation which, in general, is very difficult to solve. However, we note that if \\(n\\) is a constant then \\(\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi/\\mathrm{d}z^2=0\\). It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that if \\(n(z)\\) is a “slowly varying” function then the last term on the right-hand side of the above equation can be regarded as being small. Thus, to a first approximation Equation 10.86 yields \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\simeq \\pm k_0\\,n\n\\] and \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\phi}{\\mathrm{d}z^2} \\simeq \\pm k_0\\frac{dn}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n\\tag{10.87}\\]\nIt is clear from a comparison of Equation 10.86 and Equation 10.87 that \\(n(z)\\) can be regarded as a “slowly varying” function of \\(z\\) as long as its variation length-scale is far longer than the wavelength of the wave. In other words, provided that \\((dn/\\mathrm{d}z)/(k_0\\,n^2)\\ll 1\\).\nThe second approximation to the solution is obtained by substituting Equation 10.87 into the right-hand side of Equation 10.86: \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\simeq \\pm \\Big(k_0^{~2} n^2 \\pm i\\,k_0 \\frac{dn}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\Big)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThis gives \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\simeq \\pm k_0\\,n\\Big(1\\pm \\frac{i}{k_0 n}\\Big)^{1/2}\\simeq \\pm k_0\\,n + \\frac{i}{2n}\\frac{dn}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n\\] where a binomial expansion has been used. The above expression can be integrated to give \\[\n\\phi \\sim \\pm k_0\\! \\int^z \\!n\\,\\mathrm{d}z +i\\,\\log(n^{1/2})\n\\tag{10.88}\\]\nSubstitution of Equation 10.88 into Equation 10.84 yields the final result \\[\nE_y \\simeq A\\,n^{-1/2}\\,\\exp (\\pm i\\, k_0\\! \\int^z \\!n\\,\\mathrm{d}z )\n\\tag{10.89}\\]\nIt follows from Equation 10.83 that \\[\ncB_x\\simeq \\mp A\\, n^{1/2}\\exp\\Big(\\pm i\\,k_0 \\int^z n \\mathrm{d}z\\Big) - \\frac{iA}{2k_0 n^{3/2}}\\frac{dn}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\exp\\Big(\\pm i\\,k_0 \\int^z n \\mathrm{d}z\\Big)\n\\tag{10.90}\\]\nNote that the second term is small compared to the first, and can usually be neglected.\nLet us test to what extent Equation 10.89 is a good solution of Equation 10.82 by substituting this expression into the left-hand side of the equation. The result is \\[\n\\frac{A}{n^{1/2}}\\Big[ \\frac{3}{4}\\Big(\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\Big)^2 - \\frac{1}{2n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2n}{\\mathrm{d}z^2} \\Big]\\exp\\Big( \\pm i\\,k_0\\int^z n\\,\\mathrm{d}z\\Big)\n\\]\nThis must be small compared with either term on the left-hand side of Equation 10.82. Hence, the condition for Equation 10.89 to be a good solution of Equation 10.82 becomes \\[\n\\frac{1}{k_0^2}\\bigg\\lvert \\frac{3}{4}\\Big(\\frac{1}{n^2} \\frac{dn}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\Big)^2 -\\frac{1}{2n^3}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 n}{\\mathrm{d}z^2}\\bigg\\rvert \\ll 1\n\\tag{10.91}\\]\nThe solutions Equation 10.89 and Equation 10.90 (without the second term) are most commonly referred to as the WKB solutions, in honour of G. Wentzel, H.A. Kramers, and L. Brillouin, who are credited with independently discovering these solutions (in a quantum mechanical context) in 1926. Actually, H. Jeffries wrote a paper on the WKB solutions (in a wave propagation context) in 1923. Hence, some people call them the WKBJ solutions (or even the JWKB solutions). To be strictly accurate, the WKB solutions were first discussed by Liouville and Green in 1837, and again by Rayleigh in 1912. The advance in science discovery is always a collective achievement.\nRecall, that when a propagating wave is normally incident on an interface, where the refractive index suddenly changes (for instance, when a light wave propagating through air is normally incident on a glass slab), there is generally significant reflection of the wave. However, according to the WKB solutions, when a propagating wave is normally incident on a medium in which the refractive index changes slowly along the direction of propagation of the wave then the wave is not reflected at all. This is true even if the refractive index varies very substantially along the path of propagation of the wave, as long as it varies slowly. The WKB solutions imply that as the wave propagates through the medium its wave-length gradually changes. In fact, the wave-length at position \\(z\\) is approximately \\(\\lambda(z)= 2\\pi/ k_0\\,n(z)\\). The WKB solutions also imply that the amplitude of the wave gradually changes as it propagates. The amplitude of the electric field component is inversely proportional to \\(n^{1/2}\\), whereas the amplitude of the magnetic field component is directly proportional to \\(n^{1/2}\\). Note, however, that the energy flux in the \\(z\\)-direction, given by the the Poynting vector \\(-(E_y B_x^\\ast +E_y^\\ast B_x)/(4\\mu_0)\\), remains constant (assuming that \\(n\\) is predominately real).\nOf course, the WKB solutions are only approximations. In reality, a wave propagating into a medium in which the refractive index is a slowly varying function of position is subject to a small amount of reflection. However, it is easily demonstrated that the ratio of the reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude is of order \\((dn/\\mathrm{d}z)/(k_0\\,n^2)\\). Thus, as long as the refractive index varies on a much longer length-scale than the wavelength of the radiation, the reflected wave is negligibly small. This conclusion remains valid as long as the inequality Equation 10.91 is satisfied. This inequality obviously breaks down in the vicinity of a point where \\(n^2=0\\). We would, therefore, expect strong reflection of the incident wave from such a point. Furthermore, the WKB solutions also break down at a point where \\(n^2\\rightarrow\\infty\\), since the amplitude of \\(B_x\\) becomes infinite.\n\n\n10.12.2 Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating\nLet us look at the problem of electron cyclotron resonance heating. The resonance condition is \\(R=\\infty\\); the governing equation has the form \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\\mathrm{d}z^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\Big[ 1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}(z)}^2}{\\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce}(z))} \\Big]E = 0\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Plasma frequency and wave number as functions of \\(z\\) in a non-uniform plasma for the electron cyclotron resonance mode.\n\n\n\nWe use \\(z\\) here to remind ourselves of the fact that the wave property changes along the field line. Imagine a wave \\(\\sim e^{i(kz -\\omega t)}\\) incident into a plasma with fixed density \\(n_0\\) and varying magnetic field \\(B_0(z)\\) as shown in Figure 10.9(a). At \\(z=z_R\\), \\(\\omega_{ce}(z) = \\omega_{ce}(z_R) = \\omega\\). Then we can draw \\(k^2(z)\\) as a function of \\(z\\) as in Figure 10.9(b). There is a pole at \\(z=z_R\\), which indicates resonance since \\(k^2\\rightarrow\\infty\\). There is also a zero on the right of \\(z_R\\).\nClose to \\(z=z_R\\), we have \\(k^2(z)\\sim \\frac{\\text{const}.}{z-z_R}\\). If we write \\[\n\\Omega_e(z)=-A^\\prime (z-z_R)+\\omega,\\quad \\zeta = z-z_R\n\\]\nthen (ignore the constants) \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\\mathrm{d}z^2} - \\frac{\\text{const.}}{z-z_R}E = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{d\\zeta^2} - \\frac{1}{\\zeta}E = 0\n\\]\nNow let’s stare at Figure 10.9(b) for a few seconds. If there is a wave from left to right, there will be a resonance at \\(z=z_R\\); but if there is a wave from right to left, then the wave will be attenuated before it reaches \\(z=z_R\\) because there is a zero ahead. This means that waves from different origin will have different behaviors!\n\n\n10.12.3 O-mode\nNext consider EM waves in non-magnetized plasma of ordinary O-mode: \\[\nk^2(x) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}n^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\Big[ 1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}(x)}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big] \\quad \\text{if } n \\text{ is non-uniform}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.10: Plasma frequency and wave number as functions of \\(x\\) in a non-uniform plasma for O mode.\n\n\n\nNote that there is no energy dissipation, because it is collisionless. Imagine a wave \\(\\sim e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\) incident into a plasma with density \\(n_0(x)\\) shown in Figure 10.10. We encounter a cutoff at \\(x=x_t\\), \\(\\omega_{pe}(x_t) = \\omega\\). Therefore we can draw \\(k^2(x)\\) as a function of x as in Figure 10.10. Then the properties of the wave can be categorized into two regimes: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nk^2 &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow\\ E\\sim e^{\\pm ikx}\\ \\text{propagating}\\\\\nk^2 &gt; 0 \\Rightarrow\\ E\\sim e^{\\pm|k| x}\\ \\text{attenuating}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nA natural question comes up from this picture: how does the propagating wave transform into attentuating wave? Stokes solved this during his honey moon, which is now known as the Stokes phenomenon (Section 3.11.3).",

    "section": "10.13 Warm Uniform Plasma",
    "text": "10.13 Warm Uniform Plasma\nThe analysis of cold plasma waves, although very complicated already, leaves out all of the physics that relates to finite temperature effects. These effects may be included in varying degrees of approximation, and it is intructive to include at this stage only the simplest thermal correction terms through the inclusion of a finite pressure term. For the sake of simplicity, we only consider the 1D case. The approach is very similar to cold plasma situation, except that we have pressure included in the equation, and we also need to specify the relation of pressure and temperature through the equation of state.\n\n10.13.1 Two-fluid approach\nEquilibrium: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&m_i=\\infty,\\ T_i=0,\\ v_{i,0}=0,\\ n_{e0}=n_{i0}=n_0,\\ E_0=0,\\ B_0=0 \\\\\n&P_0=const.,\\ v_{e0}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe equation of motion for electron is \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}=-\\frac{e}{m_e}\\mathbf{E}-\\frac{\\nabla P}{\\rho}\n\\]\nAssume \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&P=P_0 \\Big( \\frac{n}{n_0}\\Big)^\\gamma  &\\text{adiabatic}\\\\\n&P=nk_B T_e  &\\text{isothermal}(\\gamma=1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDefine \\(P_1=\\Big( \\partial P/\\partial \\rho\\Big)\\rho_1\\equiv {v_{th}}^2\\rho_1={v_{th}}^2 n_1 m=k_BTn_1\\). Decompose the primitive variables into equilibrium and perturbation components:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&n= n_0+n_1=n_0+\\tilde{n}_1e^{-i\\omega t+ikx} \\\\\n&v=\\cancel{v_0}+v_1=\\tilde{v}_1 e^{-i\\omega t+ikx} \\\\\n&P=P_0+P_1=P_0+\\tilde{P}_1e^{-i\\omega t+ikx}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSubstituting into the equation of motion and keeping only first order terms, we get \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial t}&=-\\frac{e}{m_e}(E_1)-\\frac{\\nabla (P_1)}{n_0m_e} \\\\\n-i\\omega v_1&=-\\frac{e}{m_e}E_1-\\frac{ik{v_{th}}^2 n_1}{n_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe continuity equation gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big( nv\\Big)=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow v_1=\\frac{\\omega n_1}{kn_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the linearized equation of motion, we get \\[\nn_1=\\frac{kn_0eE_1}{im_e(\\omega^2-k^2{v_{th}}^2)}\n\\]\nwhich is the density perturbation in response to \\(E_1\\). Following the same approach as before, we can easily get the dielectric function: \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2-k^2{v_{th}}^2}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\epsilon=0\\), we get the dispersion relation for warm plasma \\[\n\\omega^2=k^2{v_{th}}^2+{\\omega_{pe}}^2\n\\]\nThis is called the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation (BGDR). (Swanson 2012) has shown that by keeping higher order terms, \\[\n\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2\\left[ 1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\left( \\frac{k v_{th}}{\\omega_{pe}} \\right)^2 + \\frac{15}{4}\\left( \\frac{k v_{th}}{\\omega_{pe}} \\right)^4 \\right]\n\\] so it is apparent that the moment expansion is an expansion in the ratio of the thermal velocity to the phase velocity. The BGDR now resolves the ambiguity in cold plasma theory and supports the notion that \\(P=0\\) in cold plasma is a cutoff rather than a resonance, since this dispersion relation describes a wave with a cutoff at \\(\\omega_{pe}\\) that propagates near the electron thermal speed for high frequencies.\nWe see from this example that the fluid equations which are based on moment expansions are valid as long as the phase velocity is large compared to the thermal speed, \\(v_p\\gg v_{th}\\).\n\n\n10.13.2 Vlasov approach\nAssume Maxwellian distribution for electrons: \\[\ng_e(v)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{1}{v_{th,e}}e^{-v^2/2{v_{th,e}}^2}\n\\]\nAssuming \\(\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\gg v_{th,e}\\), i.e. the phase speed is much larger than the characteristic thermal speed, we can do Taylor series expansion \\[\n\\frac{1}{(v-\\omega/k)^2}=\\frac{1}{(\\omega/k)^2}\\frac{1}{(1-kv/\\omega)^2}\\approx \\frac{k^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big[ 1+\\frac{2kv}{\\omega}+\\frac{3k^2v^2}{\\omega^2}+...\\Big]\n\\]\nThen the dielectric function is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}&=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dv g(v)\\frac{k^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big[ 1+\\frac{2kv}{\\omega}+\\frac{3k^2v^2}{\\omega^2}+...\\Big] \\\\\n&\\doteq 1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big[ 1+\\frac{3k^2{v_{th}}^2}{\\omega^2} \\Big] .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\epsilon=0\\), we can get the dispersion relation for warm plasma, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{lowest order: } \\omega=\\pm \\omega_{pe} \\\\\n&\\text{first order:} 1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big( 1+\\frac{3k^2{v_{th}}^2}{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}\\Big)=0\\Rightarrow \\omega^2={\\omega_{pe}}^2+3k^2{v_{th,e}}^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote here we insert \\(0^{th}\\) order solution to \\(1^{st}\\) order equation to get the next level approximation. Comparing with the results from 2-fluid theory, we see that the expression is very similar except a discrepancy in the coefficient. This is owing to the fact that we do not specify \\(\\gamma\\) in the equation of state. Actually, there are still ambiguities and debates about the exact equation of state. I wonder if I can get the exact coefficient under some assumption.\nThe opposite limit case: \\(\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\ll v_{th}\\). From 2-fluid theory, \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}\\approxeq1+\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}\n\\]\nFrom Vlasov theory, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}&=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dv\\frac{\\partial g/\\partial v}{v-\\omega/k}=\n1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{v-\\cancel{\\omega/k}}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{1}{v_{th,e}}\\Big(\\frac{-v}{{v_{th,e}}^2} \\Big) e^{-v^2/2{v_{th,e}}^2}dv  \\\\\n&=1+\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{v_{th,e}^2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-v^2/2{v_{th,e}}^2}dv \\\\\n&=1+\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSo we can see in the two limit cases that they “almost” give the same results!\nIf we include ion motion in the 2-fluid theory (\\(n_{1i}\\neq0, T_i\\neq0,m_i\\neq\\infty\\)), applying the linear superposition property, we have\n\\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\underbrace{1}_{\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E}_1)}-\\underbrace{\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2-k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}}_{en_{1e}}-\\underbrace{\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{\\omega^2-k^2{v_{th,i}}^2}}_{en_{1i}}\n\\]\n\n\n10.13.3 Ion-acoustic wave\nAssume \\(v_{th,e}\\gg \\frac{\\omega}{k}\\gg v_{th,i}\\), we have the simplified dielectric function \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1+\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}-\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{\\omega^2}\n\\]\nAssume quasi-neutrality condition: \\(n_{1e}\\approx n_{1i}\\), s.t. \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E}_1)=e(n_{1e}-n_{1i})\\approx 0\n\\] so we can ignore the “1” in the dielectric function. Let \\(\\epsilon=0\\), we get \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}-\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{\\omega^2}=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\omega^2=k^2{v_{th,e}}^2\\frac{m_e}{m_i},\\ \\frac{\\omega}{k}=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_BT_e}{m_i}}\\equiv c_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPhysically, electron sees the electric field created by ions due to ion plasma oscillation. Since electrons move much faster than ions, this electric field is nearly electrostatic for electrons. As a result, electron just follows the ion motion.\nThere are some other ways to get the ion-acoustic wave. If \\(\\omega\\ll \\omega_{pe}\\), we can treat this wave as electrostatic wave for electron. The distribution for electron number density is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&n_{e}=n_0e^{e\\phi/k_B T_e}\\approxeq n_{0e}+n_{1e} \\approxeq n_0[1+\\frac{e\\phi}{k_BT_e}+...] \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &n_{1e}=n_0\\frac{e\\phi}{k_BT_e}=\\frac{n_0eE_1}{-ikm_e{v_{th,e}}^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that here the tilde signs \\(\\sim\\) of the variables are neglected for convenience without ambiguity.\nDo we need to calculate \\(n_{1i}\\)??? Yes.

    "text": "10.14 Electrostatic Wave in a Magnetized Plasma\nNow we continue to discuss the property of electrostatic waves with background magnetic field.\nFirst let us introduce a useful result for continuity equation. Assuming \\(n_0=n_0(\\mathbf{x}),\\ \\mathbf{v}_0=\\mathbf{v}_0(\\mathbf{x})\\) in equilibrium, \\(\\mathbf{x}_1=\\mathbf{x}_1(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) is the perturbation in displacement. We can show that the linearized continuity equation has an equivalent form: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_1(\\mathbf{x},t)}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot[ n_0(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v}_1(\\mathbf{x},t)+n_1(\\mathbf{x},t)\\mathbf{v}_0(\\mathbf{x},t)]=0\n\\Leftrightarrow n_1(\\mathbf{x},t)=-\\nabla\\cdot[n_0(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}_1(\\mathbf{x},t)]\n\\]\nThe proof is related to mass conservation shown as follows. Intuitively, you can think of this as the degree of condensation only depends on displacement, not on how you get there (speed).\nIn 1D, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_0=n_0(x_0)=\\text{unperturbed density} \\\\\nx= x_0+x_1(x_0,t)=\\text{instantanenous position} \\\\\nn(x_0,t)=n_0(x_0)+n_1(x_0,t)=\\text{total density}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAt time \\(t\\), \\([x_0,x_0+\\mathrm{d}x]\\rightarrow[x_0+x_1(x_0,t),x_0+\\mathrm{d}x+x_1(x_0+\\mathrm{d}x,t)]\\). Due to mass conservation, we have (This looks like the derivation of deformation in fluid dynamics.)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_0(x_0)\\mathrm{d}x&=[n_0(x_0+x_1)+n_1(x_0+x_1,t)]\\cdot[x_0+\\mathrm{d}x+x_1(x_0+\\mathrm{d}x,t)-(x_0+x_1(x_0,t))] \\\\\n&\\approx \\Big[n_0(x_0)+x_1\\frac{\\partial n_0(x_0)}{\\partial x_0}+n_1(x_0,t)\\Big]\\mathrm{d}x\\Big[1+\\frac{\\partial x_1(x_0,t)}{\\partial x_0}\\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\Rightarrow n_0(x_0)=n_0(x_0)+n_0(x_0)\\frac{\\partial x_1(x_0,t)}{\\partial x_0}+x_1\\frac{\\partial n_0(x_0)}{\\partial x_0}+n_1(x_0,t) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow n_1(x_0,t)=-n_0(x_0)\\frac{\\partial x_1(x_0,t)}{\\partial x_0}-x_1\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x_0}=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0}\\big[ n_0(x_0)x_1(x_0,t) \\big] \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow n_1(x,t)=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[ n_0(x)x_1(x,t)\\big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe simplest equilibrium state in a constant magnetized plasma is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&n_{i0}=n_{e0}=n_0,\\ \\mathbf{E}_0=0,\\ \\mathbf{B}_0=B_0\\widehat{z} \\\\\n&\\mathbf{v}_{e0}=\\mathbf{v}_{i0}=0,\\ T_e=0,\\ T_i=0,\\ m_i=\\infty\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow introduce an electrostatic perturbation (\\(\\mathbf{E}_1=-\\nabla\\phi_1\\)) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E}_1=\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}_1}e^{-i\\omega t+i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}=-i\\mathbf{k}\\tilde{\\phi}_1 e^{-i\\omega t+i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwe can confirm that this is indeed an electrostatic perturbation since \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\parallel \\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_1=0\\).\nCase 1: \\(\\mathbf{k}=k_z\\widehat{z}\\parallel \\mathbf{B}_0\\), i.e. parallel propagation. Then \\(\\mathbf{E}_1=\\widehat{z}E_{1z}e^{-i\\omega t+ik_z z}\\). This is the same as if there is no magnetic field, so the dielectric function is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2}\n\\]\nCase 2: \\(\\mathbf{k}\\perp \\mathbf{B}_0\\), i.e. perpendicular propagation. Without loss of generality, let \\(\\mathbf{k}=k_x\\widehat{x}\\). Then\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E}_1=\\widehat{x}\\tilde{E}_{1x}e^{-i\\omega t+ik_x x}\n\\]\nThe equations of motion (cold plasma) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) direction are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{x}_1 &= -\\frac{e}{m_e}[E_{1x}+\\dot{y}_1B_0] \\\\\n\\ddot{y}_1 &= -\\frac{e}{m_e}[-\\dot{x}_1B_0] \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\dot{y}_1&=\\frac{eB_0}{m_e}x_1=|\\Omega_e| x_1  \\\\\n\\ddot{x}_1&=-\\frac{e}{m_e}[E_{1x}+|\\Omega_e|\\cdot{y_1}B_0]=-\\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1x}-{\\Omega_e}^2 x_1,  \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x_1&=\\frac{-\\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1x}}{-\\omega^2+{\\Omega_e}^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen we have the perturbed density in response to the perturbed electric field \\(E_{1x}\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_1=-n_0\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_1=-n_0ik_x x_1=-n_0ik_x\\frac{-\\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1x}}{-\\omega^2+{\\Omega_e}^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom Poisson’s equation, we get the dielectric function (the same method as before): \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2-{\\Omega_e}^2}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\epsilon=0\\), we have \\[\n\\omega=\\sqrt{{\\omega_{pe}}^2+{\\Omega_e}^2}\\equiv \\omega_{UH}\n\\] which is called the upper hybrid frequency. This is the highest characteristic frequency in plasma. This upper hybrid wave is a havoc to some beam generator devices as it appears near the electron collector.\nWhat if ions are included? Similar to previous derivations and notice that we are still within the range of linear theory, we have \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2-{\\Omega_e}^2}-\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{\\omega^2-{\\Omega_i}^2}\n\\]\nFor \\(\\Omega_i\\ll \\omega\\ll \\Omega_e\\) with quasi-neutrality condition \\(n_{1e}\\approx n_{1i}\\), we can have a simplified dispersion relation by letting \\(\\epsilon=0\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{{\\Omega_{e}}^2}=\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{\\omega^2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow& \\omega=\\sqrt{{\\omega_{pi}}^2\\frac{{\\Omega_e}^2}{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}}=\\sqrt{|\\Omega_e \\Omega_i|}\\equiv \\omega_{LH}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which gives us the low hybrid wave frequency. It equals to the geometric mean of the two cyclotron frequencies. Actually, this can be obtained from pure plasma motion argument. Recall that \\(\\Omega_i \\ll \\omega \\ll \\Omega_e\\) means that for electrons the plasma seems to be nonmagnetized, so they moves only under the electric field, \\[\nv_{1ex}=\\frac{-eE_{1x}}{m_e(-i\\omega)}\n\\]\nOn the other hand, for ions the magnetic field is strong while electric field still exists, so it experiences polarization drift along the direction of perturbed electric field, \\[\nv_{1ix}=\\frac{1}{\\Omega_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Big( \\frac{E_{1x}}{B_0}\\Big)\n\\]\nUnder quasi-neutrality condition, \\(v_{1ix}=v_{1ex}\\), so we have \\[\n\\frac{-eE_{1x}}{m_e(-i\\omega)}=\\frac{1}{\\Omega_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Big( \\frac{E_{1x}}{B_0}\\Big) \\Rightarrow \\omega=\\sqrt{|\\Omega_e \\Omega_i|}\n\\]\nIf we consider warm plasma for 1D, there is an additional pressure term in the momentum equation. The continuity equation together with Poisson’s equation give the relation of perturbed displacement and electric field: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&n_1=-\\nabla\\cdot(n_0\\mathbf{x}_1)=-ik_xn_0x_1 \\\\\n&\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E}_1)=ik_x\\epsilon_0E_{1}=-en_{1e}=eik_xn_0x_1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow& E_{1}=\\frac{en_0x_1}{\\epsilon_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSubstituting into the momentum equation, we get \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{x}_1+{\\Omega_e}^2x_1&=-\\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1}-\\frac{\\nabla P_1}{n_0m_e}  \\\\\n&=-{\\omega_{pe}}^2 x_1-{k_x}^2{v_{th,e}}^2x_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(v_{th,e}=\\sqrt{k_BT_e/m_e}\\). This gives us (You can gain a sense of the equivalent force law from the dispersion relation.) \\[\n\\omega^2={\\omega_{pe}}^2+{\\Omega_e}^2+{k_x}^2{v_{th,e}}^2\n\\]\nThis is also equivalent to the dielectric function \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{\\omega^2-{\\Omega_{e}}^2-{k_x}^2{v_{th,e}}^2}\n\\]",

For \\(\\xi&gt;5\\) there are increasingly fewer particles with higher velocities for the resonance (higher than the thermal speed).\n\n10.16.1 Pitch Angle Scattering\nCharged particles can be scattered by the wave electric and magnetic fields incoherently, and the scattering deforms the velocity distribution function along the co-centric contours centered at the wave phase speed (Figure 10.11, right panel). The reason for the deformation is that the particle kinetic energy \\(K_{wv}\\) (per unit mass) does not change in the co-moving frame with the apparent wave phase speed in the parallel direction to the mean magnetic field: \\[\nK_{wv} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ v_\\perp^2 + \\left( v_\\parallel - \\frac{\\omega}{k_\\parallel} \\right)^2 \\right] = \\text{const}.\n\\]\nThe co-centric deformation of the distribution function achieves a quasi-linear equilibrium in that the velocity–space gradient becomes zero (plateau formation) in the pitch angle directions. For example, in the solar wind ions are found to be resonating with obliquely propagating Alfvén/ion cyclotron waves. Note that the relevant phase speed is \\(\\omega/k_\\parallel\\), and is different from the true phase speed \\(\\omega/k\\). The perpendicular component of the wavevector \\(k_\\perp\\) does not play a role in pitch angle scattering.\nThis process is well explained by Plasma Zoo: Gyroresonant Scattering.",

    "section": "10.17 Whistler Wave",
    "text": "10.17 Whistler Wave\nThere exist different terminologies for whistler waves in the space and laboratory communities. In space science, a “whistle” is specifically defined as an electromagnetic wave excited by lightning and dispersed while propagating through the ionosphere and magnetosphere. All other excitation mechanisms lead to whistler-mode wave. Depending on their sound and spectrograms they are given many exotic names such as hiss, roar, saucers, chorus, risers, hooks, triggered emissions, etc, which are essentially the same thing with slightly different behaviors. In laboratory plasma physics any wave propagating in the whistler mode is simply called a whistler wave. However, in bounded laboratory plasmas, in particular solid state plasmas, these waves are often called helicons.\nWhistler waves are most often referring to electron whistler waves, also known as electron cyclotron waves. Electron whistler waves are VLF emissions observed in the frequency range between the lower hybrid resonance frequency \\(\\omega_\\mathrm{LH}\\) (Equation 10.28) and electron gyrofrequency \\(\\Omega_\\mathrm{e} = eB/m_e\\).3 They are a type of electron-scale plasma waves that contribute to electron scattering, acceleration, and energy transport.4 They are driven by the electron temperature anisotropy (\\(T_{e\\perp}/T_{e\\parallel}&gt;1\\), and the parallel energy of the resonant electrons exceeds the magnetic energy per electron, \\(\\mathcal{E}_\\parallel = \\frac{1}{2}m_e v_\\parallel^2 &gt; B^2 / 2\\mu_0 n_e\\), just like EMIC waves are stimulated by the temperature anisotropy of the ions (Kennel and Petschek 1966).) or by electron beams or heat fluxes (Gary 1993), and shape the electron velocity distribution function through wave-particle interactions.5 (Ren+ 2020)\nWhistler modes are dispersive waves (i.e., group and phase velocities are frequency-dependent), which can propagate oblique to the static magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) up to a limiting “resonance cone” angle, given for electrons by (Stenzel 1999) \\[\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{phase, max}} = \\cos^{-1}(\\omega/\\Omega_e)\n\\]\nNear the oblique resonance the group and phase velocities are essentially orthogonal, and the wave energy is dominated by the electric field. For frequencies \\(\\omega &lt; \\Omega_e/2\\) there exists an oblique mode at \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{phase} = \\cos^{-1}(2\\omega/\\Omega_e)\\) with parallel group velocity called the Gendrin mode [Gendrin 1961]. Along the direction of wave propagation \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) the wave magnetic field is right-hand circularly polarized. The electric field of oblique whistlers has both space charge and inductive contributions, \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi - \\partial \\mathbf{A}/\\partial t\\). At an oblique density discontinuity the reflection of whistlers produces two reflected and one transmitted mode [Lee, 1969]. Refraction of whistlers in density nonuniformities has been studied carefully [Smith, 1961; Helliwell, 1965; Walker, 1976] since it explains the remarkable ducting properties of whistlers. Ducting confines the wave energy in a field-aligned density crest or trough and allows oblique whistlers to propagate undamped over long distances along \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\). All ground observations of whistlers, in particular the multiply reflected whistlers, involve ducting.\nPlane whistler waves can decay because of\n\nelectron collisions with neutrals and ions,\ncollisionless electron cyclotron damping (\\(\\omega - \\Omega_e = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_e\\)), and\nLandau damping for oblique modes (\\(\\omega = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_e\\)).\n\nand it can grow when the distribution function at the resonant velocity has a positive slope because of\n\nCherenkov instabilities\ncyclotron resonance\nLandau resonance\n\nWhistler wave can decay into lower hybrid and kinetic Alfven waves. Parametric instabilities can trap whistler decay waves along the resonance cone. The stability of whistlers in plasmas with non-Maxwellian distribution functions has been studied theoretically in detail [Lee and Crawford, 1970]. The interaction of Langmuir waves and whistlers can produce the observed filamentary fine structure of solar type IV radio bursts [Fomichev and Fainshtein, 1988].\nNote that there are also MHD whistler modes in the range of the ion cyclotron frequency \\(\\Omega_i\\) [Russell+ 1971; Albert, 1980]. Properties of whistler waves can relate closely to electron-scale physics in magnetic reconnection (e.g. (Wang et al. 2023) at Mars, THEMIS observation in Earth’s tail reconnection exhaust region, and lower-hybrid instability).\nWe first see the derivations of whistler wave dispersion relation in Section 10.7 at the low frequency MHD limit. Another way to derive the whistler mode dispersion relation, which is probably easier, is to include the Hall term from the generalized Ohm’s law: \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{U}\\times\\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{ne}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\nUsing Ampère’s law and retaining only the Hall term leads to the equation \\[\n\\dot{\\mathbf{B}} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 ne}\\nabla\\times[(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B}]\n\\]\nPerforming linearization and assuming that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis and its perturbation is only in x and y, the last equation becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega B_{1x} &= -i\\frac{k_z^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 ne} B_{1y} \\\\\n\\omega B_{1y} &=  i\\frac{k_z^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 ne} B_{1x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which easily yields \\[\n\\omega = \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 ne} k_z^2\n\\]\nThis is the \\(v_A\\ll W\\) case in Equation 10.25 where \\(v_w = W\\). For a more complete derivation, see Chen Shi’s note. The dispersion relations of whistler and ion cyclotron wave make a pair, similar to the relation between fast and slow magnetosonic waves.\nThe dispersion property of whistler waves makes it a problem for hybrid simulations (Section 30.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.12: Whistler wave.\n\n\n\nIn situ measurements are sensitive to the entire spectrum of oblique whistlers (\\(\\omega &lt; \\Omega_e \\cos\\theta\\)), hence most of the observed whistlers are oblique, unducted, magnetospherically reflected waves (Stenzel 1999). ???\n\n10.17.1 Ducting of Whistler Waves\nDucting refers to the confinement of whistler waves within channels or “ducts” formed by variations in plasma density along the magnetic field lines. The density can be modulated by instabilities and thereby modifies the whistler wave propagation and amplitude. Most common are density modifications via the ponderomotive force, thermal pressure, and ionization, which can lead to self-focusing and filamentation instabilities.\n\nDensity Enhancements and Depletions: Whistler waves can become trapped within regions of higher or lower plasma density relative to the surrounding environment. These density variations create what are called ducts.\nRefraction: The speed of a whistler wave depends on the plasma density. As whistler waves encounter changes in density along a magnetic field line, they undergo refraction (bending), similar to how light bends when passing between different materials.\nConfinement: The refraction caused by density gradients can keep the whistler waves confined within the duct. The waves essentially bounce back and forth within the duct as they propagate along the magnetic field line.\n\nTypes of Ducts:\n\nDensity Enhancement Ducts: Whistler waves become trapped in regions of higher plasma density.\nDensity Depletion Ducts: Whistler waves become trapped in regions of lower plasma density.\n\nSignificance of Ducting:\n\nWave Guidance: Ducting allows whistler waves to travel over much longer distances than they otherwise would in a homogeneous plasma.\nWave Amplification: Ducting can lead to the amplification of whistler wave intensity.\nInteraction with Particles: Ducted whistler waves can interact with charged particles trapped in the Earth’s radiation belts, leading to particle acceleration, scattering, and loss. This plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the radiation belts.\n\n\n\n10.17.2 Whistlers in EMHD\nWhile many wave phenomena are thought of in terms of plane monochromatic eigenmodes, a vast class of whistler phenomena arise in the form of temporal transients and spatially bounded phenomena, i.e., wave packets. Such transient phenomena are common in electron magnetohydrodynamicss (EMHD) physics (Chapter 11). In contrast to ordinary MHD where the plasma behaves like a single magnetized fluid, in EMHD only the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. This arises on timescales \\(f_{ce}^{-1} &lt; t &lt; f_{ci}^{-1}\\) and spatial scales \\(r_{Le} &lt; r &lt; r_{Li}\\). The transition region is the Hall MHD. Refer to Stenzel (1999) for more detailed comparisons.\nSpecifically for whistlers, the whistler wave can be described by EMHD on timescales of \\(2\\pi/\\Omega_{ce}&lt;t&lt;2\\pi/\\Omega_{LH}\\) and spatial scales of \\(L&lt;\\lambda_i\\), where the ions are assumed as a motionless neutralizing background [Zhao 2017]. When magnetic field lines are fully frozen into the electron fluid, the whistler wave follows the dispersion relation \\(\\omega=\\Omega_{ce}\\lambda_e^2 k^2\\cos\\theta\\). The dispersion relation becomes \\(\\omega=\\Omega_{ce}\\lambda_e^2 k^2\\cos\\theta/(1+\\lambda_e^2 k^2)\\) as the electron inertia is contained in Ohm’s law. Jinsong Zhao further extended the model by taking the electron thermal pressure and the displacement current into the EMHD model.\n\n\n10.17.3 Importance of whistler\n\nThey play an important role in both the acceleration and loss of electrons in the radiation belt in the inner magnetosphere (See the series of studies by Thorne, R. M).\n\nLower energy electrons (~ keV) generate chorus waves -&gt; relax temperature anisotropy -&gt; waves scatter electrons into the loss cone and lead to electron precipitation into the ionosphere.\n\nChorus wave is the driver of pulsating aurora (Nishimura+ 2010) and diffuse aurora (Thorne+ 2010).\nChorus waves may be the source of hiss waves in the plasmasphere. Hiss waves play an important role in scattering electrons into the loss cone in the slot region.",

    "section": "10.18 Wave Identification",
    "text": "10.18 Wave Identification\nMeasured wave spectra are complex and opaque, i.e. it is very difficult from an inspection of their shape to identify the wave modes that are present in the plasma volume under investigation. In some rare clean cases one can conclude from the observation of a particular maximum peak in the wave power or the observation of only one single field component which wave has been detected. In the general case of broad spectra or mixed spectral peaks and various field components lacking clear dominance of one field component it becomes nearly impossible to decide about the waves. Clearly, when the spectrum is a shapeless power-law one, in most cases, we are dealing with developed turbulence or localised structures in which case it makes no sense to distinguish and search for single modes. Then one must seek shelter among the well developed methods of analysing turbulence.\nOn the other hand, if the spectra indicate the presence of single waves, one would like to have some quantities at hand which help identifying which modes one is dealing with. It would be helpful if one could measure simultaneously both, the wave frequency and the wave number spectra. This is possible, however, only with sophisticated multi-spacecraft constellations. And even then only in the rarest cases the determination of the dispersion relation from experiment will be possible.\nIn application of these theoretical arguments to real observations one therefore has defined some quantities, called “transport ratios”, which have turned out to be quite valuable in helping identifying some of the wave modes. Such transport ratios for electromagnetic waves have been given by (Gary 1993).\n\nPolarization\n\nThe polarization of a wave magnetic field with respect to wave number \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) is given by \\[\nP = i b_s / b_A\n\\] where \\(b_s, b_A\\) are the components of the magnetic fluctuation field \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction \\(\\mathbf{S},\\mathbf{A}\\) of magnetosonic and Alfvén waves, respectively, i.e. the vector \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0\\) is perpendicular to the wave vector and the ambient magnetic field, while the vector \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) (because of the vanishing divergence \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=0\\)) in the plane \\((\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{B}_0)\\). The waves are more magnetosonic or more Alfvénic whether \\(|P|&gt;1\\) \\(|P|&lt;1\\), respectively. For \\(\\Re(P)&gt;0 (&lt;0)\\) the waves are right-hand (left-hand) polarized.\n\nCompression\n\nThe magnetic compression of the wave measures the relative variation in the parallel magnetic fluctuation field \\[\nC_B = \\langle b_\\parallel^2 \\rangle / \\langle |\\mathbf{b}|^2 \\rangle\n\\] where the fluctuations are taken at a given pair \\((\\omega,\\mathbf{k})\\). The angular brackets \\(\\left&lt; ab \\right&gt;\\) mean taking the real part of the correlation function of the two bracketed quantities.\n\nParallel compressibility\n\nThis ratio together with the compression ratio provides a tool for estimating how compressive a wave is. It is defined for species \\(s\\) as \\[\nC_{\\parallel s} = \\frac{B_0^2}{\\langle b_\\parallel^2 \\rangle} \\frac{\\langle b_\\parallel \\Delta n_s \\rangle}{n_s B_0}\n\\]\n\nNon-coplanarity ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the fluctuating field component out of the plane \\((\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{B}_0)\\), and is given by \\[\nC_c = \\langle b_A^2 \\rangle / \\langle |\\mathbf{b}|^2 \\rangle\n\\]\n\nAlfvén ratio: the ratio of velocity to magnetic fluctuations\n\nDefining \\(\\delta\\mathbf{v}_A = \\mathbf{b} / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 m_i n}\\) (unit V/B), where \\(n\\) is the total plasma density, the Alfvén ratio is defined as \\[\nR_{As} = \\langle |\\delta\\mathbf{v}_s|^2 \\rangle / \\langle |\\delta\\mathbf{v}_A|^2 \\rangle\n\\] where \\(\\delta \\mathbf{v}_s\\) is the flow velocity of species \\(s\\). An Alfvén wave has \\(\\delta \\mathbf{v}_i = \\pm \\mathbf{v}_A \\mathbf{b}/\\mathbf{B}_0\\), and its own Alfvén ratio is \\(R_{Ai} = 1\\). The Alfvén ratio thus measures the fraction of Alfvén waves contained in the near-zero frequency fluctuations.\nIn another form, it can be written as \\[\nR_A = \\mu_0 n m_i \\frac{|\\delta v_i|^2}{|\\delta\\mathbf{B}|^2}\n\\]\nOne property that differs significantly is the Alfvén ratio where velocity fluctuations dominate for the kinetic slow wave and magnetic fluctuations dominate for the KAW.\n\nCross helicity\n\nHelicity of a wave is another identifier of the wave mode, it is in particular useful for determining the direction of propagation of the wave by considering its sign.

    "section": "12.2 Distribution Function",
    "text": "12.2 Distribution Function\nThe fluid theory we have been using so far is the simplest description of a plasma; it is indeed fortunate that this approximation is sufficiently accurate to describe the majority of observed phenomena. There are some phenomena, however, for which a fluid treatment is inadequate. At any given time, each particle has a specific position and velocity. We can therefore characterize the instantaneous configuration of a large number of particles by specifying the density of particles at each point \\(x, v\\) in phase-space. The function prescribing the instantaneous density of particles in phase-space is called the distribution function and is denoted by \\(f(x, v, t)\\). Thus, \\(f(x, v, t)\\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}v\\) is the number of particles at time \\(t\\) having positions in the range between \\(x\\) and \\(x+dx\\) and velocities in the range between \\(v\\) and \\(v+dv\\). As time progresses, the particle motion and acceleration causes the number of particles in these \\(x\\) and \\(v\\) ranges to change and so \\(f\\) will change. This temporal evolution of \\(f\\) gives a description of the system more detailed than a fluid description, but less detailed than following the trajectory of each individual particle. Using the evolution of \\(f\\) to characterize the system does not keep track of the trajectories of individual particles, but rather characterizes classes of particles having the same \\(x, v\\).\nIn fluid theory, the dependent variables are functions of only four independent variables: \\(x, y, z,\\) and \\(t\\). This is possible because the velocity distribution of each species is assumed to be Maxwellian everywhere and can therefore be uniquely specified by only one number, the temperature \\(T\\). Since collisions can be rare in high-temperature plasmas, deviations from thermal equilibrium can be maintained for relatively long times. As an example, consider two velocity distributions \\(f_1(v_x)\\) and \\(f_2(v_x)\\) in a one-dimensional system (Figure 12.2). These two distributions will have entirely different behaviors, but as long as the areas under the curves are the same, fluid theory does not distinguish between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Examples of non-Maxwellian distribution functions\n\n\n\nWhen we consider velocity distributions in 3D, we have seven independent variables: \\(f = f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t)\\). By \\(f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t)\\), we mean that the number of particles per meter cubed at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and time \\(t\\) with velocity components between \\(v_x\\) and \\(v_x + dv_x\\), \\(v_y\\) and \\(v_y + dv_y\\), and \\(v_z\\) and \\(v_z + dv_z\\) is \\[\nf(x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z, t) \\mathrm{d}v_x \\mathrm{d}v_y \\mathrm{d}v_z\n\\]\n\n12.2.1 Moments of the distribution function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Moments give weighted averages of the particles in the shaded vertical strip.\n\n\n\nLet us count the particles in the shaded vertical strip in Figure 12.3. The number of particles in this strip is the number of particles lying between \\(x\\) and \\(x + \\mathrm{d}x\\), where \\(x\\) is the location of the left-hand side of the strip and \\(x + \\mathrm{d}x\\) is the location of the right-hand side. The number of particles in the strip is equivalently defined as \\(n(x, t)\\mathrm{d}x\\), where \\(n(x)\\) is the density of particles at \\(x\\). Thus we see that \\(\\int f(x, v)\\mathrm{d}v = n(x)\\) the transition from a phase-space description (i.e., \\(x, v\\) are independent variables) to a conventional description (i.e., only \\(x\\) is an independent variable) involves “integrating out” the velocity dependence to obtain a quantity (e.g., density) depending only on position. Since the number of particles is finite, and since \\(f\\) is a positive quantity, \\(f\\) must vanish as \\(v\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty\\).\nIn three-dimension, the density is now a function of four scalar variables, \\(n=n(\\mathbf{r}, t)\\), which is the integral of the distribution function over the velocity space: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn(\\mathbf{r}, t) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}v_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}v_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}v_z f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t) \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t)\\mathrm{d}^3v \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t)\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{12.1}\\]\nNote that \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\\) is not a vector; it stands for a three-dimensional volume element in velocity space. If \\(f\\) is normalized so that \\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t) \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = 1\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\nThus \\[\n\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t) = f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t) / n(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n\\tag{12.3}\\] is the probability that a randomly selected particle at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) has the velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) at time \\(t\\). Using this point of view, we see that averaging over the velocities of all particles at \\(x\\) gives the mean velocity \\[\nu(\\mathrm{x},t)=\\frac{\\int\\mathbf{v}f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v},t)\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{n(\\mathbf{x},t)}\n\\tag{12.4}\\]\nSimilarly, multiplying \\(\\hat{f}\\) by \\(mv^2/2\\) and integrating over velocity will give an expression for the mean kinetic energy of all the particles. This procedure of multiplying \\(f\\) by various powers of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and then integrating over velocity is called taking moments of the distribution function.\nNote that \\(\\hat{f}\\) is still a function of seven variables, since the shape of the distribution, as well as the density, can change with space and time. From Equation 12.2, it is clear that \\(\\hat{f}\\) has the dimensions \\((\\text{m}/\\text{s})^{-3}\\); and consequently, from Equation 12.3, \\(f\\) has the dimensions \\(\\text{s}^3 \\text{m}^{-6}\\).\n\n\n12.2.2 Maxwellian Distribution\nA particularly important distribution function is the Maxwellian: \\[\n\\hat{f}_m = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right)\n\\tag{12.5}\\] where \\[\nv\\equiv(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)^{1/2}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad v_{th}\\equiv(2k_B T/m)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThis is the normalized form where \\(\\hat{f}_m\\) is equivalent to probability: by using the definite integral \\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\exp(-x^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}\n\\] one easily verifies that the integral of \\(\\hat{f}_m\\) over \\(\\mathrm{d}v_x \\mathrm{d}v_y \\mathrm{d}v_z\\) is unity.\nA common question to ask is: why do we see Maxwellian/Gaussian/normal distribution ubiquitously in nature? Well, this is related to the central limit theorem in statistics: in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed (e.g. a biased coin which give 95% head and 5% tail). In statistical physics, this is related to the fact that a Maxwellian distribution represents the state of a system with the highest entropy under the constraint of energy conservation.\nThere are several average velocities of a Maxwellian distribution that are commonly used. The root-mean-square velocity is given by \\[\n(\\overline{v^2})^{1/2} = (3k_B T/m)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThe average magnitude of the velocity \\(|v|\\), or simply \\(\\bar{v}\\), is found as follows: \\[\n\\bar{v} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}v\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{v})d^3v\n\\]\nSince \\(\\hat{f}_m\\) is isotropic, the integral is most easily done in spherical coordinates in v space. Since the volume element of each spherical shell is \\(4\\pi v^2 \\mathrm{d}v\\), we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{v} &= (m/2\\pi k_B T)^{3/2}\\int_0^\\infty v[\\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)]4\\pi v^2 \\mathrm{d}v \\\\\n&= (\\pi v_{th}^2)^{-3/2} 4\\pi v_{th}^4 \\int_0^\\infty [\\exp(-y^2)]y^3 dy\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe definite integral has a value 1/2, found by integration by parts. Thus \\[\n\\bar{v} = 2\\sqrt{\\pi}v_{th} = 2(2k_B T/\\pi m)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThe velocity component in a single direction, say \\(v_x\\), has a different average. Of course, \\(\\bar{v}_x\\) vanishes for an isotropic distribution; but \\(|\\bar{v}_x|\\) does not: \\[\n|\\bar{v}_x| = \\int |v_x|\\hat{f}_m(\\mathbf{v})\\mathrm{d}^3 v = \\pi^{-1/2}v_{th} = (2k_B T/\\pi m)^{1/2}\n\\]\nTo summarize: for a Maxwellian, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{rms} &= (3k_B T/m)^{1/2} \\\\\n|\\bar{v}| &= 2(2k_B T/\\pi m)^{1/2} \\\\\n|\\bar{v}_x| &= (2k_B T/\\pi m)^{1/2} \\\\\n\\bar{v}_x &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor an isotropic distribution like a Maxwellian, we can define another function \\(g(v)\\) which is a function of the scalar magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) such that \\[\n\\int_0^\\infty g(v) \\mathrm{d}v = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\mathbf{v})\\mathrm{d}v\n\\]\nFor a Maxwellian, we see that \\[\ng(v) = 4\\pi n (m/2\\pi k_B T)^{3/2} v^2 \\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)\n\\tag{12.6}\\]\nFigure 12.4 shows the difference between \\(g(v)\\) and a one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution \\(f(v_x)\\). Although \\(f(v_x)\\) is maximum for \\(v_x=0\\), \\(g(v)\\) is zero for \\(v=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: One- and three-dimensional Maxwellian velocity distributions.\n\n\n\nThis is just a consequence of the vanishing of the volume in phase space for \\(v=0\\). Sometimes \\(g(v)\\) is carelessly denoted by \\(f(v)\\), as distinct from \\(f(\\mathbf{v})\\); but \\(g(v)\\) is a different function of its argument than \\(f(\\mathbf{v})\\) is of its argument. From eq-g_dist, it is clear that \\(g(v)\\) has dimensions \\(\\text{s}/\\text{m}^4\\).\nADD EXAMPLE DISTRIBUTIONS!\n\nisotropic\nanisotropic (pancake)\n\n\\[\nf(v_\\perp, v_\\parallel) = \\frac{n}{T_\\perp T_\\parallel^{1/2}}\\Big( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B} \\Big)^{3/2} \\exp\\Big( -\\frac{mv_\\perp^2}{2k_B T_\\perp} - \\frac{m(v_\\parallel - v_{0\\parallel})^2}{2k_B T_\\parallel} \\Big)\n\\]\n\nbeam\ncrescent shape\n\nIt is often convenient to present the distribution function as a function of energy instead of velocity. If all energy is kinetic, the energy is simply obtained from \\(W=mv^2/2\\). In the case the particles are in the external electric potential field \\(U=-q\\varphi\\) the total energy of particles is \\(W=mv^2/2+U\\) and the Maxwellian distribution is \\[\nf(v) = n\\Big(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\Big)^{3/2}\\exp\\Big(-\\frac{W}{k_B T}\\Big)\n\\]\nThis can be written as the energy distribution (???): \\[\ng(W) = 4\\pi\\Big[ \\frac{2(W-U)}{m^3} \\Big]^{1/2} f(v)\n\\]\nThe normalization factor is determined by requiring that the integration of the energy distribution over all energies gives the density.\nVelocity and energy distribution functions cannot be measured directly. Instead, the observed quantity is the particle flux to the detector. Particle flux is defined as the number density of particles multiplied by the velocity component normal to the surface. We define the differential flux of particles traversing a unit area per unit time, unit solid angle (in spherical coordinates the differential solid angle is \\(d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi\\)) and unit energy as \\(J(W,\\Omega, \\alpha, \\mathbf{r},t)\\). (\\(\\alpha\\) is species?) The units of \\(J\\) are normally given as \\((\\text{m}^2\\text{sr}\\text{s}\\text{eV})^{-1}\\). Note that in literature \\(\\text{cm}\\) is often used instead of \\(\\text{m}\\) and, depending on the actual energy range considered, electron volts are often replaced by keV, MeV, or GeV.\nLet us next define how differential particle flux and distribution function are related to each other. We can write the number density in a differential velocity element (in spherical coordinates \\(d^3v=v^2dvd\\Omega\\)) as (\\(dn=f(\\alpha,\\mathbf{r},t)v^2dvd\\Omega\\)). By multiplying this with \\(v\\) we obtain another expression for the differential flux \\(f(\\alpha,\\mathbf{r},t)v^3dvd\\Omega\\). Comparing with our eailier definition of the differential flux we obtain \\[\nJ(W,\\Omega, \\alpha, \\mathbf{r},t)dWd\\Omega = f(\\alpha,\\mathbf{r},t)v^3dvd\\Omega\n\\]\nSince \\(\\mathrm{d}W=mvdv\\) we can write the relationship between the differential flux and the distribution function as \\[\nJ(W,\\Omega, \\alpha, \\mathbf{r},t) = \\frac{v^2}{m}f\n\\tag{12.7}\\]\nOne application of the differential flux is the particle precipitation flux. With the idea of loss lone, we have a cone of particles that moves along the field lines and can propagate down to the ionosphere, and each shell from \\(v\\) to \\(v+\\mathrm{d}v\\) corresponds to a specific energy range. This is something we can measure close to the ground and use to infer the plasma properties in the magnetosphere.\n\n\n12.2.3 Kappa Distribution\nThe Maxwellian distribution is probably the most studied one theoretically, but may not be the most commonly observed distribution in a collisionless space plasma system. In recent years, another distribution named Kappa distribution has gained more attention.\nDistribution functions are often nearly Maxwellian at low energies, but they decrease more slowly at high energies. At higher energies the distribution is described better by a power law than by an exponential decay of the Maxwell distribution. Such a behavior is not surprising if we remember that the Coulomb collision frequency decreases with increasing temperature as \\(T^{-3/2}\\) (Equation 9.23). Hence, it takes longer time for fast particles to reach Maxwellian distirbution than for slow particles. The kappa distribution has the form \\[\nf_\\kappa(W) = n\\Big( \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\kappa W_0} \\Big)^{3/2}\\frac{\\Gamma(\\kappa + 1)}{\\Gamma(\\kappa-1/2)}\\Big( 1+\\frac{W}{\\kappa W_0} \\Big)^{-(\\kappa+1)}\n\\]\nHere \\(W_0\\) is the energy at the peak of the particle flux and \\(\\Gamma\\) is the gamma function. When \\(\\kappa\\gg 1\\) the kappa distribution approaches the Maxwellian distribution. When \\(\\kappa\\) is smaller but \\(&gt;1\\) the distribution has a high-energy tail. A thorough review is given by (Livadiotis and McComas 2013).\n\n\n12.2.4 Entropy of a distribution\nCollisions cause the distribution function to tend towards a simple final state characterized by having the maximum entropy for the given constraints (e.g. fixed total energy). To see this, we provide a brief discussion of entropy and show how it relates to a distribution function.\nSuppose we throw two dice, labeled \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and let \\(R\\) denote the result of a throw. Thus \\(R\\) ranges from 2 through 12. The complete set of (A,B) combinations that gives these \\(R\\)’s is listed in Table 12.1:\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: All possible combinations of rolling two dices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(R\\)\n\\((A,B)\\)\n\n\n\n\n2\n(1,1)\n\n\n3\n(1,2),(2,1)\n\n\n4\n(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)\n\n\n5\n(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)\n\n\n6\n(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)\n\n\n7\n(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)\n\n\n8\n(2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,2)\n\n\n9\n(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3)\n\n\n10\n(4,6),(5,5),(6,4)\n\n\n11\n(5,6),(6,5)\n\n\n12\n(6,6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are six \\((A, B)\\) pairs that give \\(R = 7\\), but only one pair for \\(R = 2\\) and only one pair for \\(R = 12\\). Thus, there are six microscopic states (distinct \\((A, B)\\) pairs) corresponding to \\(R = 7\\) but only one microscopic state corresponding to each of \\(R = 2\\) or \\(R = 12\\). Thus, we know more about the microscopic state of the system if \\(R=2\\) or \\(R=12\\) than if \\(R=7\\). We define the entropy \\(S\\) to be the natural logarithm of the number of microscopic states corresponding to a given macroscopic state. Thus, for the dice, the entropy would be the natural logarithm of the number of \\((A, B)\\) pairs that correspond to a given \\(R\\). The entropy for \\(R = 2\\) or \\(R = 12\\) would be zero since \\(S = \\ln(1) = 0\\), while the entropy for \\(R = 7\\) would be \\(S = \\ln(6)\\) since there were six different ways of obtaining \\(R = 7\\).\nIf the dice were to be thrown a statistically large number of times the most likely result for any throw is \\(R = 7\\) this is the macroscopic state with the largest number of microscopic states. Since any of the possible microscopic states is an equally likely outcome, the most likely macroscopic state after a large number of dice throws is the macroscopic state with the highest entropy.\nNow consider a situation more closely related to the concept of a distribution function. In order to do this we first pose the following simple problem: suppose we have a pegboard with \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) holes, labeled \\(h_1\\), \\(h_2\\), …, \\(h_{\\mathcal{N}}\\) and we also have \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) pegs labeled by \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\), …, \\(p_{\\mathcal{N}}\\). What is the number of ways of putting all the pegs in all the holes? Starting with hole \\(h_1\\), we have a choice of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) different pegs, but when we get to hole \\(h_2\\) there are now only \\(\\mathcal{N}-1\\) pegs remaining so that there are now only \\(\\mathcal{N}-1\\) choices. Using this argument for subsequent holes, we see there are \\(\\mathcal{N}!\\) ways of putting all the pegs in all the holes.\nLet us complicate things further. Suppose that we arrange the holes in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) groups. Say group \\(G_1\\) has the first 10 holes, group \\(G_2\\) has the next 19 holes, group \\(G_3\\) has the next 4 holes and so on, up to group \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). We will use \\(f\\) to denote the number holes in a group, thus \\(f(1)=10\\), \\(f(2)=19\\), \\(f(3)=4\\), etc. The number of ways arranging pegs within a group is just the factorial of the number of pegs in the group, e.g., the number of ways of arranging the pegs within group 1 is just 10! and so in general the number of ways of arranging the pegs in the jth group is \\([f(j)]!\\).\nLet us denote \\(C\\) as the number of ways of putting all the pegs in all the groups without caring about the internal arrangement within groups. The number of ways of putting the pegs in all the groups caring about the internal arrangements in all the groups is \\(C\\times f(1)!\\times f(2)\\times f(3)!\\times ... f(4)!\\), but this is just the number of ways of putting all the pegs in all the holes, i.e., \\[\nC\\times f(1)!\\times f(2)\\times f(3)!\\times ... f(4)! = \\mathcal{N}!\n\\] or \\[\nC = \\frac{\\mathcal{N}!}{C\\times f(1)!\\times f(2)\\times f(3)!\\times ... f(4)!}\n\\]\nNow \\(C\\) is just the number of microscopic states corresponding to the macroscopic state of the prescribed grouping \\(f(1) = 10\\), \\(f(2) = 19\\), \\(f(3) = 4\\), etc. so the entropy is just \\(S = \\ln C\\) or \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS &= \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\mathcal{N}!}{C\\times f(1)!\\times f(2)\\times f(3)!\\times ... f(4)!} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\ln\\mathcal{N}! - \\ln f(1)! - \\ln f(2)! - ... - \\ln f(\\mathcal{M})!\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nStirling’s formula shows that the large-argument asymptotic limit of the factorial function is \\[\n\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty} \\ln k! = k\\ln k - k\n\\]\nNoting that \\(f(1)+f(2)+...+f(\\mathcal{M})=\\mathcal{N}\\), the entropy becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS &= \\mathcal{N}\\ln\\mathcal{N} - f(1)\\ln f(1) - f(2)\\ln f(2) - ... - f(\\mathcal{M})\\ln f(\\mathcal{M}) \\\\\n&= \\mathcal{N}\\ln\\mathcal{N} - \\sum_{j=1}^{\\mathcal{M}}\\ln f(j)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe constant \\(\\mathcal{N}\\ln\\mathcal{N}\\) is often dropped, giving \\[\nS = -\\sum_{j=1}^{\\mathcal{M}} f(j)\\ln f(j)\n\\]\nIf \\(j\\) is made into a continuous variable, say \\(j \\rightarrow v\\) so that \\(f(v)\\mathrm{d}v\\) is the number of items in the group labeled by \\(v\\) then the entropy can be written as \\[\nS = -\\int\\mathrm{d}v f(v)\\ln f(v)\n\\]\nBy now, it is obvious that \\(f\\) could be the velocity distribution function, in which case \\(f(v)\\mathrm{d}v\\) is just the number of particles in the group having velocity between \\(v\\) and \\(v+\\mathrm{d}v\\). Since the peg groups correspond to different velocity range coordinates, having more dimensions just means having more groups and so for three dimensions the entropy generalizes to \\[\nS = -\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} f(\\mathbf{v})\\ln f(\\mathbf{v})\n\\]\nIf the distribution function depends on position as well, this corresponds to still more peg groups, and so a distribution function that depends on both velocity and position will have the entropy \\[\nS = -\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v})\\ln f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v})\n\\tag{12.8}\\]\n\n\n12.2.5 Effect of collisions on entropy\nThe highest entropy state is the most likely state of the system because the highest entropy state has the highest number of microscopic states corresponding to the macroscopic state. Collisions (or other forms of randomization) will take some initial prescribed microscopic state and scramble the phase-space positions of the particles, thereby transforming the system to a different microscopic state. This new state could in principle be any microscopic state, but is most likely to be a member of the class of microscopic states belonging to the highest entropy macroscopic state. Thus, any randomization process such as collisions will cause the system to evolve towards the macroscopic state having the maximum entropy.\nAn important shortcoming of this argument is that it neglects any conservation relations that have to be satisfied. To see this, note that the expression for entropy could be maximized if all the particles are put in one group, in which case \\(C = \\mathcal{N}!\\) which is the largest possible value for \\(C\\). Thus, the maximum entropy configuration of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) plasma particles corresponds to all the particles having the same velocity. However, this would assign a specific energy to the system, which would in general differ from the energy of the initial microstate. This maximum entropy state is therefore not accessible in isolated systems, because energy would not be conserved if the system changed from its initial microstate to the maximum entropy state.\nThus, a qualification must be added to the argument. Randomizing processes will scramble the system to attain the state of maximum entropy consistent with any constraints placed on the system. Examples of such constraints would be the requirements that the total system energy and the total number of particles must be conserved. We therefore reformulate the problem as: given an isolated system with \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) particles in a fixed volume \\(V\\) and initial average energy per particle \\(\\left&lt;E\\right&gt;\\), what is the maximum entropy state consistent with conservation of energy and conservation of number of particles? This is a variational problem because the goal is to maximize \\(S\\) subject to the constraint that both \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{N}\\left&lt;E\\right&gt;\\) are fixed. The method of Lagrange multipliers can then be used to take into account these constraints. Using this method the variational problem becomes \\[\n\\delta S - \\lambda_1\\delta\\mathcal{N} - \\lambda_2\\delta(\\mathcal{N}\\left&lt;E\\right&gt;) = 0\n\\] where \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) are as-yet undetermined Lagrange multipliers. The number of particles is \\[\n\\mathcal{N} = V\\int f\\mathrm{d}v\n\\]\nThe energy of an individual particle is \\(E = mv^2/2\\), where \\(v\\) is the velocity measured in the rest frame of the center of mass of the entire collection of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) particles. Thus, the total kinetic energy of all the particles in this rest frame is \\[\n\\mathcal{N}\\left&lt;E\\right&gt; = V\\int\\frac{mv^2}{2}f(v)\\mathrm{d}v\n\\] and so the variational problem becomes \\[\n\\delta\\int\\mathrm{d}v\\left( f\\ln f - \\lambda_1 Vf - \\lambda_2 V\\frac{mv^2}{2}f \\right) = 0\n\\]\nIncorporating the volume \\(V\\) into the Lagrange multipliers, and factoring out the coefficient \\(\\delta f\\), this becomes \\[\n\\int\\mathrm{d}v \\delta f \\left( 1+\\ln f - \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2\\frac{mv^2}{2} \\right) = 0\n\\]\nSince \\(\\delta f\\) is arbitrary, the integrand must vanish, giving \\[\n\\ln f = \\lambda_2\\frac{mv^2}{2} - \\lambda_1\n\\] where the “1” has been incorporated into \\(\\lambda_1\\).\nThe maximum entropy distribution function of an isolated, energy and particle conserving system is therefore \\[\nf = \\lambda_1\\exp\\left( -\\lambda_2 mv^2/2 \\right)\n\\] which is the Maxwellian distribution function. We will often assume that the plasma is locally Maxwellian so that \\(\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_1(\\mathbf{x},t), \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_2(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). We define the temperature to be \\[\nk_B T_s(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_2(\\mathbf{x},t)}\n\\]\nThe normalization factor is set to be \\[\n\\lambda_1(\\mathbf{x},t) = n_s(\\mathbf{x},t)\\left( \\frac{m_s}{2\\pi k_B T_s(\\mathbf{x},t)} \\right)^{N/2}\n\\] where \\(N\\) is the dimensionality (1, 2 or 3) so that \\(\\int f_s(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v},t)\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}=n_s(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). Because the kinetic energy of individual particles was defined in terms of velocities measured in the rest frame of the center of mass of the complete system of particles, if this center of mass is moving in the lab frame with a velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}_s\\), then in the lab frame the Maxwellian will have the form \\[\nf_s(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v},t) = n_s\\left( \\frac{m_s}{2\\pi k_B T_s} \\right)^{N/2} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{m_s(\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{u}_s)^2}{2k_B T_s} \\right)\n\\tag{12.9}\\]\nEquation 12.9 is equivalent to Equation 12.5 times number density in 3D.",

    "text": "12.3 Equations of Kinetic Theory\n\n12.3.1 Vlasov equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: A box within phase-space having width \\(\\mathrm{d}x\\) and height \\(\\mathrm{d}v\\).\n\n\n\nNow consider the rate of change of the number of particles inside a small box in phase-space, such as is shown in Figure 12.5. Defining \\(a(x, v, t)\\) to be the acceleration of a particle, it is seen that the particle flux in the horizontal direction is \\(fv\\) and the particle flux in the vertical direction is \\(fa\\). Thus, the particle fluxes into the four sides of the box are:\n\nflux into left side of box is \\(f(x, v, t)v\\mathrm{d}v\\)\nflux into right side of box is \\(-f(x+\\mathrm{d}x, v, t)v\\mathrm{d}v\\)\nflux into bottom of box is \\(f(x, v, t)a(x, v, t)\\mathrm{d}x\\)\nflux into top of box is \\(-f(x, v+dv, t)a(x, v+dv, t)dx\\)\n\nThe number of particles in the box is \\(f(x, v, t)\\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}v\\) so that the rate of change of the number of particles in the box is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial f(x,v,t)}{\\partial t}\\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}v &= -f(x+\\mathrm{d}x,v,t)v\\mathrm{d}v + f(x,v,t)v\\mathrm{d}v \\\\\n& -f(x,v+\\mathrm{d}v,t)a(x,v+\\mathrm{d}v,t)\\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n& +f(x,v,t)a(x,v,t)\\mathrm{d}x\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] or, on Taylor expanding the quantities on the right-hand side, we obtain the one-dimensional Vlasov equation, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + v\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(a f) = 0\n\\tag{12.10}\\]\nIt is straightforward to generalize Equation 12.10 to three dimensions and so obtain the three-dimensional Vlasov equation, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla f +\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}f) = 0\n\\tag{12.11}\\]\nThe symbol \\(\\nabla\\) stands, as usual, for the gradient in \\((x, y, z)\\) space. The symbol \\(\\partial/\\partial\\mathbf{v}\\) or \\(\\nabla_\\mathbf{v}\\) stands for the gradient in velocity space: \\[\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} = \\hat{x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_x} + \\hat{y}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_y} + \\hat{z}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_z}\n\\]\nBecause \\(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v}\\) are independent quantities in phase-space, the spatial derivative term has the commutation property, \\[\n\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}f)\n\\]\nThe particle acceleration is given by the Lorentz force \\[\n\\mathbf{a}=\\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\nBecause \\((\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})_i=v_jB_k - v_kB_j\\) is independent of \\(v_i\\), the term \\(\\partial(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})_i/\\partial v_i\\) vanishes so that even though the Lorentz acceleration \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is velocity-dependent, it nevertheless commutes with the vector velocity derivative as \\[\n\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}f)\n\\]\nBecause of this commutation property the Vlasov equation can also be written as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} + \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}} = 0\n\\tag{12.12}\\]\nIf we “sit on top of” a particle that has a phase-space trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}(t),\\, \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}(t)\\) and measure the distribution function as we move along with the particle, the observed rate of change of the distribution function will be \\(\\mathrm{d}f(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{v}(t), t)/\\mathrm{d}t\\), where the \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}t\\) means that the derivative is measured in the moving frame. Because \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}/\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}/\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathbf{a}\\), this observed rate of change is \\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{v}(t), t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)_\\mathrm{orbit} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} + \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}} = 0\n\\]\nThus, the distribution function \\(f\\) as measured when moving along a particle trajectory (orbit) is constant. This gives a powerful method for finding solutions to the Vlasov equation. Since \\(f\\) is a constant when measured in a frame following an orbit, we can choose \\(f\\) to depend on any quantity that is constant along the orbit (Jeans 1915, Watson 1956).\nFor example, if the energy \\(E\\) of particles is constant along their orbits then \\(f = f(E)\\) is a solution to the Vlasov equation. On the other hand, if both the energy and the momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) are constant along particle orbits, then any distribution function with the functional dependence \\(f = f(E, \\mathbf{p})\\) is a solution to the Vlasov equation. Depending on the situation at hand, the energy and/or momentum may or may not be constant along an orbit and so whether or not \\(f = f(E, \\mathbf{p})\\) is a solution to the Vlasov equation depends on the specific problem under consideration. However, there always exists at least one constant of the motion for any trajectory because, just like every human being has an invariant birthday, the initial conditions of a particle trajectory are invariant along this trajectory. As a simple example, consider a situation where there is no electromagnetic field so that \\(\\mathbf{a}=0\\), in which case the particle trajectories are simply \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{x}_0+ \\mathbf{v}_0(t),\\, \\mathbf{v}(t) = \\mathbf{v}_0\\), where \\(\\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{v}_0\\) are the initial position and velocity. Let us check to see whether \\(f(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) is a solution to the Vlasov equation. By writing \\(\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{x}(t) - \\mathbf{v}_0 t\\) so \\(f(\\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\mathbf{v}_0 t)\\) we observe that indeed \\(f = f(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) is a solution, since \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} + \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}} = \\mathbf{v}_0\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_0)} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{v}_0\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}} = 0\n\\]\n\n\n12.3.2 Boltzmann equation\nIt was shown in ??? that the cumulative effect of grazing collisions dominates the cumulative effect of the more infrequently occurring large-angle collisions. In order to see how collisions affect the Vlasov equation, let us now temporarily imagine that the grazing collisions are replaced by an equivalent sequence of abrupt large scattering angle encounters as shown in Figure 12.6. Two particles involved in a collision do not significantly change their positions during the course of a collision, but they do substantially change their velocities. For example, a particle making a head-on collision with an equal mass stationary particle will stop after the collision, while the target particle will assume the velocity of the incident particle. If we draw the detailed phase-space trajectories characterized by a collision between two particles we see that each particle has a sudden change in its vertical coordinate (i.e., velocity) but no change in its horizontal coordinate (i.e., position). The collision-induced velocity jump occurs very fast so that if the phase-space trajectories were recorded with a “movie camera” having insufficient framing rate to catch the details of the jump, the resulting movie would show particles being spontaneously created or annihilated within given volumes of phase-space (e.g., within the boxes shown in Figure 12.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Detailed view of collisions causing “jumps” in phase-space.\n\n\n\nThe details of these individual jumps in phase-space are complicated and yet of little interest since all we really want to know is the cumulative effect of many collisions. It is therefore both efficient and sufficient to follow the trajectories on the slow time scale while accounting for the apparent “creation” or “annihilation” of particles by inserting a collision operator on the right-hand side of the Vlasov equation. In the example shown here it is seen that when a particle is apparently “created” in one box, another particle must be simultaneously “annihilated” in another box at the same \\(x\\) coordinate but a different \\(v\\) coordinate (of course, what is actually happening is that a single particle is suddenly moving from one box to the other). This coupling of the annihilation and creation rates in different boxes constrains the form of the collision operator. We will not attempt to derive collision operators in this chapter but will simply discuss the constraints on these operators. From a more formal point of view, collisions are characterized by constrained sources and sinks for particles in phase-space and inclusion of collisions in the Vlasov equation causes the Vlasov equation to assume the form \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}f_s) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}f_s) = \\sum_\\alpha C_{s\\alpha}(f_s)\n\\tag{12.13}\\] where \\(C_{s\\alpha}(f_s)\\) is the rate of change of \\(f_s\\) due to collisions of species \\(s\\) with species \\(\\alpha\\)1. This is called the Boltzmann equation.\nThe constraints that must be satisfied by the collision operator \\(C_{s\\alpha}(f_s)\\) are as follows:\n\nConservation of particles - Collisions cannot change the total number of particles at a particular location so \\[\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} C_{s\\alpha}(f_s) = 0\n\\tag{12.14}\\]\nConservation of momentum - Collisions between particles of the same species cannot change the total momentum of that species so \\[\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} m_s\\mathbf{v}C_{ss}(f_s) = 0\n\\tag{12.15}\\] while collisions between different species must conserve the total momentum of both species together so \\[\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} m_i\\mathbf{v}C_{ie}(f_i) + \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} m_e\\mathbf{v}C_{ei}(f_e) = 0\n\\tag{12.16}\\]\nConservation of energy - Collisions between particles of the same species cannot change the total energy of that species so \\[\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} m_s\\mathbf{v}^2C_{ss}(f_s) = 0\n\\tag{12.17}\\] while collisions between different species must conserve the total energy of both species together so \\[\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} m_i\\mathbf{v}^2C_{ie}(f_i) + \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} m_e\\mathbf{v}^2C_{ei}(f_e) = 0\n\\tag{12.18}\\]\n\nIn a sufficiently hot plasma, collisions can be neglected. If, furthermore, the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is entirely electromagnetic, Equation 12.13 takes the special form of Equation 12.12. Because of its comparative simplicity, this is the equation most commonly studied in kinetic theory. When there are collisions with neutral atoms, the collision term in Equation 12.13 can be approximated by \\[\n\\Big( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\Big)_c = \\frac{f_n - f}{\\tau}\n\\] where \\(f_n\\) is the distribution function of the neutral atoms, and \\(\\tau\\) is a constant collision time. This is called the Krook collision term. It is the kinetic generalization of the collision term in Eq. (5.5) in (Chen 2016). When there are Coulomb collisions, Equation 12.13 can be approximated by \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(f\\left&lt;\\Delta\\mathbf{v}\\right&gt;)\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}\\partial\\mathbf{v}}:(f\\left&lt;\\Delta\\mathbf{v}\\Delta\\mathbf{v}\\right&gt;)\n\\tag{12.19}\\]\nThis is called the Fokker-Planck equation; it takes into account binary Coulomb collisions only. Here, \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{v}\\) is the change of velocity in a collision, and Equation 12.19 is a shorthand way of writing a rather complicated expression. The colon operator \\(\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b}:\\mathbf{c}\\mathbf{d} = a_ib_jc_id_j\\).\nThe fact that \\(\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is constant in the absence of collisions means that particles follow the contours of constant \\(f\\) as they move around in phase space. As an example of how these contours can be used, consider the beam-plasma instability of Section ???. In the unperturbed plasma, the electrons all have velocity \\(v_0\\), and the contour of constant \\(f\\) is a straight line. The function \\(f(x, v_x)\\) is a wall rising out of the plane of the paper at \\(v_x=v_0\\). The electrons move along the trajectory shown. When a wave develops, the electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) causes electrons to suffer changes in \\(v_x\\) as they stream along. The trajectory then develops a sinusoidal ripple (Figure 12.7 B). This ripple travels at the phase velocity, not the particle velocity. Particles stay on the curve as they move relative to the wave. If \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) becomes very large as the wave grows, and if there are a few collisions, some electrons will be trapped in the electrostatic potential of the wave. In coordinate space, the wave potential appears as in Figure 12.8. In phase space, \\(f(x, v_x)\\) will have peaks wherever there is a potential trough (Figure 12.9). Since the contours of \\(f\\) are also electron trajectories, one sees that some electrons move in closed orbits in phase space; these are just the trapped electrons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: (A) Representation in one-dimensional phase space of a beam of electrons all with the same velocity \\(v_0\\). The distribution function \\(f(x, v_x)\\) is infinite along the line and zero elsewhere. The line is also the trajectory of individual electrons, which move in the direction of the arrow. (B) when a plasma wave exists in the electron beam. The entire pattern moves to the right with the phase velocity of the wave. If the observer goes to the frame of the wave, the pattern would stand still, and electrons would be seen to trace the curve with the velocity \\(v_0-v_\\phi\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: The potential of a plasma wave, as seen by an electron.

    "text": "12.4 Derivation of the Fluid Equations\nInstead of just taking moments of the distribution function \\(f\\) itself, moments will now be taken of the entire Vlasov equation to obtain a set of partial differential equations relating the mean quantities \\(n(\\mathbf{x}),\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})\\), etc. We begin by integrating the Vlasov equation, Equation 12.12, over velocity for each species. This first and simplest step in the procedure is called taking the “zeroth” moment, since the operation of multiplying by unity can be considered as multiplying the entire Vlasov equation by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) raised to the power zero. Multiplying the Vlasov equation by unity and then integrating over velocity gives \\[\n\\int\\left[ \\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}f_s) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}f_s) \\right]\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = \\sum_\\alpha \\int C_{s\\alpha}(f_s)\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nThe velocity integral commutes with both the time and space derivatives on the left-hand side because \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(t\\) are independent variables, while the third term on the left-hand side is the volume integral of a divergence in velocity space. Gauss’ theorem (i.e., \\(\\int_V\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{Q}=\\int_A\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{Q}\\)) gives \\(f_s\\) evaluated on a surface at \\(v=\\infty\\). However, because \\(f_s\\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(v\\rightarrow\\infty\\), this surface integral in velocity space vanishes. Inserting Equation 12.1, Equation 12.4, and Equation 12.14 into the above, we have the species continuity equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s)=0\n\\tag{12.20}\\]\nNow let us multiply Equation 12.12 by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and integrate over velocity to take the “first moment”, \\[\n\\int \\mathbf{v}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}f_s) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}f_s) \\right]\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = \\sum_\\alpha \\int \\mathbf{v}C_{s\\alpha}(f_s)\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nThis may be rearranged in a more tractable form by:\n\npulling both the time and space derivatives out of the velocity integral,\nwriting \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}^\\prime(\\mathbf{x},t) + \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) is the random part of a given velocity, i.e., that part of the velocity that differes from the mean (note that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is independent of both \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(t\\) but \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\) is not; also \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}=\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\) since \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is independent of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)),\nintegrating by parts in 3-D velocity space on the acceleration term and using \\[\n\\partial_i\\mathbf{v}_j = \\delta_{ij}\n\\]\n\nAfter performing these manipulations, the first moment of the Vlasov equation becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\int\\left( \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\mathbf{v}^\\prime + \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\mathbf{u}_s + \\mathbf{u}_s\\mathbf{v}^\\prime +\\mathbf{u}_s\\mathbf{u}_s \\right)f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime \\\\\n- \\frac{q_s}{m_s}\\int \\left( \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\right)f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime = -\\frac{1}{m_s}\\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{12.21}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\\) is the net frictional drag force due to collisions of species \\(s\\) with species \\(\\alpha\\). Note that \\(\\mathbf{R}_{ss} = 0\\), since a species cannot exert a net drag force on itself. The frictional terms have the form \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{R}_{ei} &= \\nu_{ei}m_e n_e (\\mathbf{u}_e - \\mathbf{u}_i) \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{ie} &= \\nu_{ie}m_i n_i (\\mathbf{u}_i - \\mathbf{u}_e)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] so that in the ion frame the drag on electrons is simply the total electron momentum \\(m_e n_e\\mathbf{u}_e\\) measured in this frame multiplied by the rate \\(\\nu_{ei}\\) at which this momentum is destroyed by collisions with ions. This form for frictional drag force has the following properties: (i) \\(\\mathbf{R}_{ei} + \\mathbf{R}_{ie} = 0\\), showing that the plasma cannot exert a frictional drag force on itself, (ii) friction causes the faster species to be slowed down by the slower species, and (iii) there is no friction between species if both have the same mean velocity.\nEquation 12.21 can be further simplified by factoring \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) out of the velocity integrals and recalling that by definition \\(\\int \\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime=0\\). Thus Equation 12.21 reduces to \\[\nm_s\\left[ \\frac{\\partial(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot(n_s\\mathbf{u}_s\\mathbf{u}_s) \\right] = n_s q_s (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_s\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_s - \\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\n\\] where the pressure tensor is defined by \\[\n\\overleftrightarrow{P}_s \\equiv m_s\\int \\mathbf{v}^\\prime \\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\n\\tag{12.22}\\]\nIf \\(f_s\\) is an isotropic function of \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\), then the off-diagonal terms in \\(\\overleftrightarrow{P}_s\\) vanish and the three diagonal terms are identical. In this case, it is useful to define the diagonal terms to be the scalar pressure \\(p_s\\), i.e., \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np_s &= m_s \\int v_x^\\prime v_x^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime = m_s \\int v_y^\\prime v_y^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime = m_s \\int v_z^\\prime v_z^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime \\\\\n&= \\frac{m_s}{3} \\int \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\cdot \\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{12.23}\\]\nEquation 12.23 defines pressure for a three-dimensional isotropic system. However, we will often deal with systems of reduced dimensionality, i.e., systems with just one or two dimensions. Equation 12.23 can therefore be generalized to these other cases by introducing the general N-dimensional definition for scalar pressure \\[\np_s = \\frac{m_s}{N}\\int \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\cdot \\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\n\\tag{12.24}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\) is the N-dimensional random velocity.\nThe scalar pressure has a simple relation to the generalized Maxwellian as seen by recasting Equation 12.24 as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np_s &= \\frac{m_s}{N}\\int \\mathbf{v}^\\prime\\cdot \\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s \\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}^\\prime \\\\\n&= \\frac{n_s m_s}{N}\\left( \\frac{m_s}{2\\pi k_B T_s} \\right)^{N/2} \\int {\\mathbf{v}^\\prime}^2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{m_s {\\mathbf{v}^\\prime}^2}{2k_B T_s} \\right) \\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}^\\prime \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n_s m_s}{N}\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi} \\right)^{N/2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}\\int e^{-\\alpha {v^\\prime}^2}\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}^\\prime,\\, \\alpha \\equiv m_s/2k_B T_s \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n_s m_s}{N}\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi} \\right)^{N/2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi} \\right)^{-N/2} \\\\\n&= n_s k_B T_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which is just the ideal gas law. Thus, the definitions that have been proposed for pressure and temperature are consistent with everyday notions for these quantities.\nIt is important to emphasize that assuming isotropy is done largely for mathematical convenience and that in real systems the distribution function is often quite anisotropic. Collisions, being randomizing, drive the distribution function towards isotropy, while competing processes simultaneously drive it towards anisotropy. Thus, each situation must be considered individually in order to determine whether there is sufficient collisionality to make \\(f\\) isotropic. Because fully ionized hot plasmas often have insufficient collisions to make \\(f\\) isotropic, the often-used assumption of isotropy is an oversimplification, which may or may not be acceptable depending on the phenomenon under consideration.\nOn expanding the derivatives on the left-hand side of Equation 12.21, it is seen that two of the terms combine to give \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) times Equation 12.20. After removing this embedded continuity equation, E@eq-vlasov-1st-moment reduces to \\[\nn_s m_s\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} = n_s q_s(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_s\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla p_s - \\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\n\\] where the operator \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is the convective derivative (Equation 3.2).\nAt this point in the procedure it becomes evident that a certain pattern recurs for each successive moment of the Vlasov equation. When we took the zeroth moment, an equation for the density \\(\\int f\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\\) resulted, but this also introduced a term involving the next higher moment, namely the mean velocity \\(\\sim\\int\\mathbf{v}f\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\\). Then, when we took the first moment to get an equation for the velocity, an equation was obtained containing a term involving the next higher moment, namely the pressure \\(\\sim\\int \\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}f\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}\\). Thus, each time we take a moment of the Vlasov equation, an equation for the moment we want is obtained, but because of the \\(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla f\\) term in the Vlasov equation, a next higher moment also appears. Thus, moment-taking never leads to a closed system of equations; there will always be a “loose end”, a highest moment for which there is no determining equation. Some sort of ad hoc closure procedure must always be invoked to terminate this chain (as seen below, typical closures involve invoking adiabatic or isothermal assumptions). Another feature of taking moments is that each higher moment embeds terms that contain complete lower moment equations multiplied by some factor. Algebraic manipulation can identify these lower moment equations and eliminate them to give a simplified higher moment equation.\nLet us now take the second moment of the Vlasov equation. Unlike the zeroth and first moments, the dimensionality of the system now enters explicitly so the more general pressure definition given by Equation 12.24 will be used. Multiplying the Vlasov equation by \\(m_s v^2/2\\) and integrating over velocity gives \\[\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\int \\frac{m_s v^2}{2}f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v} \\\\\n+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\int\\frac{m_s v^2}{2}\\mathbf{v}f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v} \\\\\n+q_s\\int\\frac{v^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}\n\\end{Bmatrix} =\n\\sum_\\alpha \\int m_s \\frac{v^2}{2}C_{s\\alpha}f_s\\mathrm{d}^N \\mathbf{v}\n\\tag{12.25}\\]\nWe consider each term of this equation separately as follows:\n\nThe time derivative term becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\int \\frac{m_s v^2}{2}f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\int \\frac{m_s(\\mathbf{v}^\\prime + \\mathbf{u}_s)^2}{2} f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}^\\prime = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{Np_s}{2} + \\frac{m_sn_su_s^2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\nAgain using \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{v}^\\prime + \\mathbf{u}_s\\), the space derivative term becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\int\\frac{m_s v^2}{2}\\mathbf{v}f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v} = \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\mathbf{Q}_s + \\frac{2+N}{2}p_s\\mathbf{u}_s + \\frac{m_sn_su_s^2}{2}\\mathbf{u}_s \\right)\n\\] where \\[\n\\mathbf{Q}_s = \\int\\frac{m_s{v^\\prime}^2}{2}\\mathbf{v}^\\prime f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v}\n\\] is called the heat flux.\nOn integrating by parts, the acceleration term becomes \\[\nq_s\\int\\frac{v^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})f_s\\mathrm{d}^N\\mathbf{v} = -q_s\\int\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{E} f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = -q_s n_s\\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nThe collision term becomes (using Equation 12.17) \\[\n\\sum_\\alpha \\int m_s \\frac{v^2}{2}C_{s\\alpha}f_s\\mathrm{d}^N \\mathbf{v} = \\int_{s\\neq \\alpha}m_s\\frac{v^2}{2}C_{s\\alpha} f_s\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} = -\\left( \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t} \\right)_\\mathrm{Es\\alpha}\n\\] where \\((\\partial W/\\partial t)_\\mathrm{Es\\alpha}\\) is the rate at which species \\(s\\) collisionally transfers energy to species \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nCombining the above four relations, Equation 12.25 becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{Np_s}{2} + \\frac{m_sn_su_s^2}{2} \\right) + \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\mathbf{Q}_s +\\frac{2+N}{2}p_s\\mathbf{u}_s + \\frac{m_sn_su_s^2}{2}\\mathbf{u}_s \\right) - q_s n_s \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\mathbf{E} \\\\\n= -\\left( \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t} \\right)_\\mathrm{E\\sigma s}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{12.26}\\]\nThis equation can be simplified by invoking two mathmatical identities, the first being \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{m_s n_s u_s^2}{2} \\right) + \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\frac{m_sn_su_s^2}{2}\\mathbf{u}_s \\right) = n_s\\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\nabla \\right)\\frac{m_su_s^2}{2} = n_s\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{m_su_s^2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\nThe second identity is obtained by dotting the equation of motion with \\(\\mathbf{u}_s\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_s m_s\\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{u_s^2}{2}\\right) + \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\left( \\nabla\\left( \\frac{u_s^2}{2} \\right) - \\mathbf{u}_s\\times\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u}_s \\right) \\right] \\\\\n= n_s q_s \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\mathbf{E} - \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\nabla p_s - \\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] or \\[\nn_s\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{m_su_s^2}{2} \\right) = n_sq_s\\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\mathbf{E} - \\mathbf{u}_s\\cdot\\nabla p_s - \\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s\n\\]\nInserting these two into Equation 12.26 gives the energy evolution equation \\[\n\\frac{N}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{2+N}{2}p_s\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s = -\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{Q}_s + \\mathbf{R}_{s\\alpha}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s - \\left(\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t}\\right)_\\mathrm{Es\\alpha}\n\\tag{12.27}\\]\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the heat flux, the second term gives the frictional heating of species \\(s\\) due to frictional drag on species \\(\\alpha\\), while the last term on the right-hand side gives the rate at which species \\(s\\) collisionally transfers energy to other species. Although Equation 12.27 is complicated, two important limiting situations become evident if we let \\(t_\\mathrm{char}\\) be the characteristic time scale for a given phenomenon and \\(l_\\mathrm{char}\\) be its characteristic length scale. A characteristic velocity \\(V_\\mathrm{ph}\\sim l_\\mathrm{char}/t_\\mathrm{char}\\) may then be defined for the phenomenon and so, replacing temporal derivatives by \\(t_\\mathrm{char}^{-1}\\) and spatial derivatives by \\(l_\\mathrm{char}^{-1}\\) in Equation 12.27, it is seen that the two limiting situations are:\n\nIsothermal limit - The heat flux term dominates all other terms, in which case the temperature becomes spatially uniform. This occurs if (i) \\(v_{Ts}\\gg V_\\mathrm{ph}\\) since the ratio of the left-hand side terms to the heat flux term is \\(\\sim V_\\mathrm{ph}/v_{Ts}\\) and (ii) the collisional terms are small enough to be ignored.\nAdiabatic limit - The heat flux terms and the collisional terms are small enough to be ignored compared to the left-hand side terms; this occurs when \\(V_\\mathrm{ph} \\gg  v_{Ts}\\). Adiabatic is a Greek word meaning “impassable”, and is used here to denote that no heat is flowing, i.e., the volume under consideration is thermally isolated from the outside world.\n\nBoth of these limits make it possible to avoid solving for \\(\\mathbf{Q}_s\\), which involves the third moment, and so both the adiabatic and isothermal limit provide a closure to the moment equations.\nThe energy equation may be greatly simplified in the adiabatic limit by re-arranging the continuity equation to give \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_s = -\\frac{1}{n_s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n_s}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\] and then substituting this expression into the left-hand side of Equation 12.27 to obtain \\[\n\\frac{1}{p_s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\gamma}{n_s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n_s}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{12.28}\\] where \\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{N+2}{N}\n\\]\nEquation 12.28 implies \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{p_s}{n_s^\\gamma} \\right) = 0\n\\] so \\(p_s/n_s^\\gamma\\) is a constant in the frame of the moving plasma. This constitutes a derivation of adiabaticity based on geometry and statistical mechanics rather than on thermodynamic arguments.\nThe energy equation derivation can also be found in An introductory guide to fluid models with anisotropic temperatures.\nAs a short summary, the fluid equations we have been using are simply moments of the Boltzmann equation. One interesting observation from Equation 12.12 is that in order to recover the hydrodynamic equations, the acceleration term \\(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\partial_\\mathbf{v}f\\) is not required: the pressure gradient that drives the flow arises from the thermal motion embedded in the advection term \\(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\partial_\\mathbf{x}f\\).\nWe must be careful not to become overconfident regarding the descriptive power of the fluid point of view because weaknesses exist in this point of view. For example, as discussed above neither the adiabatic nor the isothermal approximation is appropriate when \\(V_\\mathrm{ph}\\sim v_{Ts}\\). The fluid description breaks down in this situation and the Vlasov description must be used in this situation. Furthermore, the distribution function is Maxwellian only if there are sufficient collisions or some other randomizing process. Because of the weak collisionality of a plasma, this is very often not the case. In particular, since the collision frequency scales as \\(v^{-3}\\) (Equation 9.20), fast particles take much longer to become Maxwellian than slow particles. It is not at all unusual for a real plasma to be in a state where the low-velocity particles have reached a Maxwellian distribution whereas the fast particles form a non-Maxwellian tail.",

    "section": "12.5 Plasma Oscillations and Landau Damping",
    "text": "12.5 Plasma Oscillations and Landau Damping\nAs an elementary illustration of the use of the Vlasov equation, we shall derive the dispersion relation for electron plasma oscillations, which is originally treated from the fluid point of view. This derivation will require a knowledge of contour integration.\nIn zeroth order, we assume a uniform plasma with a distribution \\(f_0(\\mathbf{v})\\), and we let \\(\\mathbf{B}_0 = \\mathbf{E}_0 = 0\\). In first order, we denote the perturbation in \\(f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)\\) by \\(f_1(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)\\):\n\\[\nf(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t) = f_0(\\mathbf{v}) + f_1(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)\n\\]\nSince \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is now an independent variable and is not to be linearized, the first-order Vlasov equation for electron is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla f_1 - \\frac{e}{m}\\mathbf{E}_1\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} = 0\n\\tag{12.29}\\]\nAs before, we assume the ions are massive and fixed and that the waves are plane waves in the x direction \\(f_1 \\propto e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}\\). Then the linearized Vlasov equation becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i\\omega f_1 + ikv_x f_1 x &= \\frac{e}{m}E_x\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v_x} \\\\\nf_1 &= \\frac{ieE_x}{m}\\frac{\\partial f_0/\\partial v_x}{\\omega - kv_x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPoisson’s equation gives \\[\n\\epsilon_0\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1 = ik\\epsilon_0 E_x = -en_1 = -e\\int f_1 d^3v\n\\]\nSubstituting for \\(f_1\\) and dividing by \\(ik\\epsilon_0 E_x\\), we have \\[\n1 = -\\frac{e^2}{km\\epsilon_0}\\int \\frac{\\partial f_0/\\partial v_x}{\\omega - k v_x}d^3v\n\\]\nA factor \\(n_0\\) can be factored out if we replace \\(f_0\\) by a normalized function \\(\\hat{f}_0\\): \\[\n1 = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dv_z\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dv_y\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial \\hat{f}_0(v_x, v_y, v_z)/\\partial v_x}{\\omega- k v_x}dv_x\n\\]\nIf \\(f_0\\) is a Maxwellian or some other factorable distribution, the integration over \\(v_y\\) and \\(v_z\\) can be carried out easily. What remains is the one-dimensional distribution \\(\\hat{f}_0(v_x)\\). For instance, a one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution is \\[\n\\hat{f}_m(v_x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{-mv_x^2}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n\\]\nSince we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem we may drop the subscript x, begin careful not to confuse \\(v\\) (which is really \\(v_x\\)) with the total velocity \\(v\\) used earlier: \\[\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial \\hat{f}_0/\\partial v}{v - \\omega/k}\\mathrm{d}v\n\\tag{12.30}\\]\nHere, \\(\\hat{f}_0\\) is understood to be a one-dimensional distribution function, the integrations over \\(v_y\\) and \\(v_z\\) having been made. This equation holds for any equilibrium distribution \\(\\hat{f}_0(v)\\).\nThe integral in this equation is not straightforward to evaluate because of the singularity at \\(v=\\omega/k\\). One might think that the singularity would be of no concern, because in practice \\(\\omega\\) is almost always never real; waves are usually slightly damped by collisions or are amplified by some instability mechanisms. Since the velocity \\(v\\) is a real quantity, the denominator never vanishes. Landau was the first to treat this equation properly. He found that even though the singularity lies off the path of integration, its presence introduces an important modification to the plasma wave dispersion relation — an effect not predicted by the fluid theory.\nConsider an initial value problem in which the plasma is given a sinusoidal perturbation, and therefore \\(k\\) is real. If the perturbation grows or decays, \\(\\omega\\) will be complex. This integral must be treated as a contour integral in the complex \\(v\\) plane. Possible contours are shown for (a) an unstable wave, with \\(\\Im(\\omega) &gt; 0\\), and (b) a dampled wave, with \\(\\Im(\\omega) &lt; 0\\). Normally, one would evaluate the line integral along the real \\(v\\) axis by the residue theorem: \\[\n\\int_{C_1} G \\mathrm{d}v + \\int_{C_2} G \\mathrm{d}v = 2\\pi i R(\\omega/k)\n\\] where \\(G\\) is the integrand, \\(C_1\\) is the path along the real axis, \\(C_2\\) is the semicircle at infinity, and \\(R(\\omega/k)\\) is the residue at \\(\\omega/k\\). This works if the integral over \\(C_2\\) vanishes. Unfortunately, this does not happen for a Maxwellian distribution, which contains the factor \\[\n\\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)\n\\]\nThis factor becomes large for \\(v\\rightarrow \\pm i \\infty\\), and the contribution from \\(C_2\\) cannot be neglected. Landau showed that when the problem is properly treated as an initial value problem the correct contour to use is the curve \\(C_1\\) passing below the singularity. This integral must in general be evaluated numerically.\nAlthough an exact analysis of this problem is complicated, we can obtain an approximate dispersion relation for the case of large phase velocity and weak damping. In this case, the pole at \\(\\omega/k\\) lies near the real \\(v\\) axis. The contour prescribed by Landau is then a straight line along the \\(\\Re(v)\\) axis with a small semicircle around the pole. In going around the pole, one obtains \\(2\\pi i\\) time half the residue there. Then Equation 12.30 becomes \\[\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\left[ P\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0/\\partial v}{v - (\\omega/k)}\\mathrm{d}v + i\\pi \\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0}{\\partial v}\\biggr\\rvert_{v=\\omega/k} \\right]\n\\tag{12.31}\\] where \\(P\\) stands for the Cauchy principal value. To evaluate this, we integrate along the real \\(v\\) axis but stop just before encountering the pole. If the phase velocity \\(v_\\phi = \\omega/k\\) is sufficiently large, as we assume, there will not be much contribution from the neglected part of the contour, since both \\(\\hat{f}_0\\) and \\(\\partial\\hat{f}_0/\\partial v\\) are very small there. The integral above can be evaluated by integration by parts: \\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0}{\\partial v}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{v - v_\\phi} = \\left[ \\frac{\\hat{f}_0}{v-v_\\phi} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{-\\hat{f}_0 \\mathrm{d}v}{(v-v_\\phi)^2} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\hat{f}_0 \\mathrm{d}v}{(v-v_\\phi)^2}\n\\]\nSince this is just an average of \\((v-v_\\phi)^{-2}\\) over the distribution, the real part of the dispersion relation can be written \\[\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\overline{(v-v_\\phi)^{-2}}\n\\]\nSince \\(v_\\phi \\gg v\\) has been assumed, we can expand \\((v-v_\\phi)^{-2}\\): \\[\n(v-v_\\phi)^{-2} = v_\\phi^{-2}\\Big( 1 - \\frac{v}{v_\\phi} \\Big)^{-2} = v_\\phi^{-2}\\Big( 1 + \\frac{2v}{v_\\phi} + \\frac{3v^2}{v_\\phi^2} + \\frac{4v^3}{v_\\phi^3} + ... \\Big)\n\\]\nThe odd terms vanish upon taking the average, and we have \\[\n\\overline{(v-v_\\phi)^{-2}} \\approx v_\\phi^{-2} \\Big( 1 + \\frac{3\\overline{v^2}}{v_\\phi^2} \\Big)\n\\]\nWe now let \\(\\hat{f}_0\\) be Maxwellian and evaluate \\(\\overline{v^2}\\). Remembering that \\(v\\) here is an abbreviation for \\(v_x\\), we can write \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}m\\overline{v_x^2} = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T_e\n\\] there being only one degree of freedom. The dispersion relation then becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1 &= \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\frac{k^2}{\\omega^2}\\Big( 1+ 3\\frac{k^2}{\\omega^2}\\frac{k_B T_e}{m} \\Big) \\\\\n\\omega^2 &= \\omega_p^2 + \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\frac{3k_B T_e}{m}k^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf the thermal correction is small (i.e. the second term on the right-hand side is small, such that \\(\\omega \\approx \\omega_p\\)), we may replace \\(\\omega^2\\) by \\(\\omega_p^2\\) in the second term. We then have \\[\n\\omega^2 = \\omega_p^2 + \\frac{3k_B T_e}{m}k^2\n\\] which is the same as that been obtained from the fluid equations with \\(\\gamma=3\\).\nWe now return to the imaginary term in the dispersion relation. In evaluating this small term, it will be sufficiently accurate to neglect the thermal correction to the real part of \\(\\omega\\) and let \\(\\omega^2\\approx \\omega_p^2\\). From the evaluation of the real part above we see that the principle value of the integral is approximately \\(k^2/\\omega^2\\). The dispersion relation now becomes \\[\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2} + i\\pi\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0}{\\partial v}\\biggr\\rvert_{v=v_\\phi}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\omega^2 \\Big( 1 - i\\pi\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0}{\\partial v}\\biggr\\rvert_{v=v_\\phi} \\Big) = \\omega_p^2\n\\]\nTreating the imaginary term as small, we can bring it to the right-hand side and take the square root by Taylar series expansion. We then obtain \\[\n\\omega = \\omega_p\\Big( 1 + i\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0}{\\partial v}\\biggr\\rvert_{v=v_\\phi} \\Big)\n\\tag{12.32}\\]\nIf \\(\\hat{f}_0\\) is a one-dimensional Maxwellian, we have \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{f}_0}{\\partial v} = (\\pi v_{th}^2)^{-1/2} \\left( \\frac{-2v}{v_{th}^2} \\right) \\exp\\left( \\frac{-v^2}{v_{th}^2} \\right) = -\\frac{2v}{\\sqrt{\\pi}v_{th}}\\exp\\left( \\frac{-v^2}{v_{th}^2} \\right)\n\\]\nWe may approximate \\(v_\\phi\\) by \\(\\omega_p/k\\) in the coefficient, but in the exponent we must keep the thermal correction in the real part of the dispersion relation. The damping is then given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Im(\\omega) &= -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\frac{2\\omega_p}{k\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\frac{1}{v_{th}^3}\\exp\\left( \\frac{-\\omega^2}{k^2 v_{th}^2} \\right) \\\\\n&= -\\sqrt{\\pi}\\omega_p \\left( \\frac{\\omega_p}{kv_{th}} \\right)^3 \\exp\\left( \\frac{-\\omega_p^2}{k^2 v_{th}^2}\\right)\\exp\\left( \\frac{-3}{2} \\right) \\\\\n\\Im\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_p}\\right) &= -0.22 \\sqrt{\\pi}\\left( \\frac{\\omega_p}{kv_{th}} \\right)^3 \\exp\\left( \\frac{-1}{2k^2\\lambda_D^2} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\Im(\\omega)\\) is negative, there is a collisionless damping of plasma waves; this is called Landau damping. As is evident from the expression, this damping is extremely small for small \\(k\\lambda_D\\), but becomes important for \\(k\\lambda_D = \\mathcal{O}(1)\\). This effect is connected with \\(f_1\\), the distortion of the distribution function caused by the wave.",

    "section": "12.6 The Meaning of Landau Damping",
    "text": "12.6 The Meaning of Landau Damping\nThe theoretical discovery of wave damping without energy dissipation by collisions is perhaps the most astounding result of plasma physics research. That this is a real effect has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Although a simple physical explanation for this damping is now available, it is a triumph of applied mathematics that this unexpected effect was first discovered purely mathematically in the course of a careful analysis of a contour integral. Landau damping is a characteristic of collisionless plasmas, but it may also have application in other fields. For instance, in the kinetic treatment of galaxy formation, stars can be considered as atoms of a plasma interacting via gravitational rather than electromagnetic forces. Instabilities of the gas of stars can cause spiral arms to form, but this process is limited by Landau damping.\nTo see what is responsible for Landau damping, we first notice that \\(\\Im(\\omega)\\) arises from the pole at \\(v=v_\\phi\\). Consequently, the effect is connected with those particles in the distribution that have a velocity nearly equal to the phase velocity — the “resonant particles”. These particles travel along with the wave and do not see a rapidly fluctuating electric field: they can, therefore, exchange energy with the wave effectively. The easiest way to understand this exchange of energy is to picture a surfer trying to catch an ocean wave. (Warning: this picture is only for directing our thinking along the right lines; it does not correctly explain the damping.) If the surfboard is not moving, it merely bobs up and down as the wave goes by and does not gain any energy on the average. Similarly, a boat propelled much faster than the wave cannot exchange much energy with the wave. However, if the surfboard has almost the same velocity as the wave, it can be caught and pushed along by the wave; this is, after all, the main purpose of the exercise. In that case, the surfboard gains energy, and therefore the wave must lose energy and is damped. On the other hand, if the surfboard should be moving slightly faster than the wave, it would push on the wave as it moves uphill; then the wave could gain energy. In a plasma, there are electrons both faster and slower than the wave. A Maxwellian distribution, however, has more slow electrons than fast ones. Consequently, there are more particles taking energy from the wave than vice versa, and the wave is damped. As particles with \\(v\\approx v_\\phi\\) are trapped in the wave, \\(f(v)\\) is flattened near the phase velocity. This distortion is \\(f_1(v)\\) which we calculated. As seen in Fig (ADD IT!), the perturbed distribution function contains the same number of particles but has gained total energy (at the expense of the wave).\nFrom this discussion, one can surmise that if \\(f_0(v)\\) contained more fast particles than slow particles, a wave can be excited. Indeed, from the expression of \\(\\omega\\) above, it is apparent that \\(\\Im(\\omega)\\) is positive if \\(\\partial\\hat{f}_0/\\partial v\\) is positive at \\(v=v_\\phi\\). Such a distribution is shown in Fig.7-19 (ADD IT!). Waves with \\(v_\\phi\\) in the region of positive slope will be unstable, gaining energy at the expense of the particles. This is just the finite-temperature analogy of the two stream instability. When there are two cold (\\(k_B T=0\\)) electron streams in motion, \\(f_0(v)\\) consists of two \\(\\delta\\)-functions. This is clearly unstable because \\(\\partial f_0/\\partial v\\) is infinite; and indeed, we found the instability from fluid theory. When the streams have fnite temperature, kinetic theory tells us that the relative densities and temperatures of the two stream must be such as to have a region of positive \\(\\partial f_0(v)/\\partial v\\) between them; more precisely, the total distribution function must have a minimum for instability.\nThe physical picture of a surfer catching waves is very appealing, but it is not precise enough to give us a real understanding of Landau damping. There are actually two kinds of Landau damping. Both kinds are independent of dissipative collisional mechanisms. If a particle is caught in the potential well of a wave, the phenomenon is called “trapping”. As in the case of a surfer, particles can indeed gain or lose energy in trapping. However, trapping does not lie within the purview of the linear theory. That this is true can be seen from the equation of motion \\[\nm\\ddot{x} = qE(x)\n\\]\nIf one evaluates \\(E(x)\\) by inserting the exact value of \\(x\\), the equation would be nonlinear, since \\(E(x)\\) is somehting like \\(\\sin kx\\). What is done in linear theory is to use for \\(x\\) the unperturbed orbit; i.e. \\(x=x_0 + v_0 t\\). Then this becomes linear. This approximation, however, is no longer valid when a particle is trapped. When it encounters a potential hill large enough to reflect it, its velocity and position are, of course, greatly affected by the wave and are not close to their unperturbed values. In fluid theory, the equation of motion is \\[\nm\\left[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t}+(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{v} \\right] = q\\mathbf{E}(x)\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{E}(x)\\) is to be evaluated in the laboratory frame, which is easy; but to make up for it, there is the \\((\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{v}\\) term. The neglect of \\((\\mathbf{v}_1\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{v}_1\\) in linear theory amounts to the same thing as using unperturbed orbits. In kinetic theory, the nonlinear term that is neglected is, from the first-order Vlasov Equation 12.29, \\[\n\\frac{q}{m}E_1\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial v}\n\\]\nWhen the particles are trapped, they reverse their direction of travel relative to the wave, so the distribution function \\(f(v)\\) is greatly disturbed near \\(v=\\omega/k\\). This means that \\(\\partial f_1/\\partial v\\) is comparable to \\(\\partial f_0/\\partial v\\), and the term above is not negligible. Hence, trapping is not in the linear theory.\nWhen a wave grows to a large amplitude, collisionless damping with trapping does occur. One then finds that the wave does not decay monotonically; rather, the amplitude fluctuates during the decay as the trapped particles bounce back and forth in the potential wells. This is nonlinear Landau damping. Since the result before was derived from a linear theory, it must arise from a different physical effect. The question is: can untrapped electrons moving close to the phase velocity of the wave exchange energy with the wave? Before giving the answer, let us examine the energy of such electrons.\n\n12.6.1 The Kinetic Energy of a Beam of Electrons\nWe may divide the electron distribution \\(f_0(v)\\) into a large number of monoenergetic beams. Consider one of these beams: it has unperturbed velocity \\(u\\) and density \\(n_u\\). The velocity \\(u\\) may lie near \\(v_\\phi\\), so that this beam may consist of resonant electrons. We now turn on a plasma oscillation \\(E(x,t)\\) and consider the kinetic energy of the beam as it moves through the crests and troughs of the wave. The wave is caused by a self-consistent motion of all the beams together. If \\(n_u\\) is small enough (the number of beams large enough), the beam being examined has a negligible effect on the wave and may be considered as moving in a given field \\(E(x,t)\\). Let \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE &= E_0\\sin(kx-\\omega t) = -d\\phi/\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n\\phi &= (E_0/k)\\cos(kx-\\omega t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe linearized fluid equation for the beam is \\[\nm\\left(\\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x} \\right) = -eE_0\\sin(kx-\\omega t)\n\\]\nA possible solution is \\[\nv_1 = -\\frac{eE_0}{m}\\frac{\\cos(kx-\\omega t)}{\\omega-ku}\n\\]\nThis is the velocity modulation caused by the wave as the beam electrons move past. To conserve particle flux, there is a corresponding oscillation in density, given by the linearized continuity equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial x} = -n_u\\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x}\n\\]\nSince \\(v_1\\) is proportional to \\(\\cos(kx-\\omega t)\\), we can try \\(n_1 = \\bar{n}_1 \\cos(kx-\\omega t)\\). Substitution of this into the above yields \\[\nn_1 = -n_u\\frac{eE_0 k}{m}\\frac{\\cos(kx-\\omega t)}{(\\omega-ku)^2}\n\\]\n(\\(n_1\\) and \\(v_1\\) can be shown in a series of phase relation plots as in Fig.7-21)(ADD IT!) one wavelength of \\(E\\) and of the potential \\(-e\\phi\\) seen by the beam electrons.\nWe may now compute the kinetic energy \\(W_k\\) of the beam: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nW_k &= \\frac{1}{2}m(n_u+n_1)(u+v_1)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}m(n_u u^2 + n_uv_1^2 +2un_1v_1 + n_1u^2 + 2n_uuv_1 + n_1v_1^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe last three terms contain odd powers of oscillating quantites, so they will vanish when we average over a wavelength. The change in \\(W_k\\) due to the wave is found by subtracting the first term, which is the original energy. The average energy change is then \\[\n\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k \\right&gt; = \\frac{1}{2}m\\left&lt;n_uv_1^2 + 2un_1v_1\\right&gt;\n\\]\nFrom the form of \\(v_1\\), we have \\[\nn_u\\left&lt; v_1^2 \\right&gt; = \\frac{1}{2}n_u\\frac{e^2E_0^2}{m^2(\\omega-ku)^2}\n\\] the factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) representing \\(\\left&lt; \\cos^2(kx-\\omega t) \\right&gt;\\). Similarly, from the form of \\(n_1\\), \\[\n2u\\left&lt; n_1v_1 \\right&gt; = n_u\\frac{e^2E_0^2 ku}{m^2(\\omega - ku)^3}\n\\]\nConsequently, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k \\right&gt; &= \\frac{1}{4}mn_u \\frac{e^2E_0^2}{m^2(\\omega - ku)^2}\\Big[ 1+\\frac{2ku}{\\omega-ku} \\Big] \\\\\n&= \\frac{n_u}{4}\\frac{e^2E_0^2}{m}\\frac{\\omega+ku}{m^2(\\omega - ku)^3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis result shows that \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k\\right&gt;\\) depends on the frame of the observer and that it does not change secularly with time. Consider the picture of a frictionless block sliding over a washboard-like surface. (ADD FIGURE!) In the frame of the washboard, \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k \\right&gt;\\) is proportional to \\(-(ku)^{-2}\\), as seen by taking \\(\\omega = 0\\). It is intuitively clear that (1) \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k \\right&gt;\\) is negative, since the block spends more time at the peaks than at the valleys, and (2) the block does not gain or lose energy on the average, once the oscillation is started (no time-dependence). Now if one goes into a frame in which the washboard is movign with a steady velocity \\(\\omega/k\\) (a velocity unaffected by the motion of the block, since we have assumed that \\(n_u\\) is negligibly small compared with the density of the whole plasma), it is still true that the block does not gain or lose energy on the average, once the oscillation is started. But the above equation tells us that \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k\\right&gt;\\) depends on the velocity \\(\\omega/k\\), and hence on the frame of the observer. In particular, it shows that a beam has less energy in the presence of the wave than in its absence if \\(\\omega - ku&lt;0\\) or \\(u&gt;u_\\phi\\), and it has more energy if \\(\\omega - ku&gt;0\\) or \\(u&lt;u_\\phi\\). The reason for this can be traced back to the phase relation between \\(n_1\\) and \\(v_1\\). As Fig.7-23 (ADD IT!) shows, \\(W_k\\) is a parabolic function of \\(v\\). As \\(v\\) oscillates between \\(u-|v_1|\\) and \\(u+|v_1|\\), \\(W_k\\) will attain an average value larger than the equilibrium value \\(W_{k0}\\), provided that the particle spends an equal amount of time in each half of the oscillation. This effect is the meaning of the first term \\(\\frac{1}{2}m\\left&lt; n_uv_1^2 \\right&gt;\\), which is positive definite. The second term \\(\\frac{1}{2}m\\left&lt; 2un_1v_1 \\right&gt;\\) is a correction due to the fact that the particle does not distribution its time equally. In Fig.7-21 (ADD IT!), one sees that both electrons a and b spend more time at the top the potential hill than at the bottom, but electron a reaches that point after a period of deceleration, so that \\(v_1\\) is negative there, while electron b reaches that point after a period of acceleration (to the right), so that \\(v_1\\) is positive there. This effect causes \\(\\left&lt;W_k\\right&gt;\\) to change sign at \\(u=v_\\phi\\).\n\n\n12.6.2 The Effect of Initial Conditions\nThe result we have just derived, however, still has nothing to do with linear Landau damping. Damping requires a continuous increase of \\(W_k\\) at the expense of wave energy, but we have found that \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k\\right&gt;\\) for untrapped particles is contant in time. If neither the untrapped particles nor the trapped particles are responsible for linear Landau damping, what is? The answer can be gleaned form the following observation: if \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k\\right&gt;\\) is positive, say, there must have been a time when it was increasing. Indeed, there are particles in the original distribution which have velocities so close to \\(v_\\phi\\) that at time \\(t\\) they have not yet gone a half wavelength relative to the wave. For these particles, one cannot take the average \\(\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k\\right&gt;\\). These particles can absorb energy from the wave and are properly called the “resonant” particles. As time goes on, the number of resonant electrons decreases, since an increasing number will have shifted more than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\) from their orginal positions. The damping rate, however, can stay constant, since the amplitude is now smaller, and it takes fewer electrons to maintain a constant damping rate.\nThe effect of the initial conditions is most easily seen form a phase-space diagram (Fig.7-24)(ADD IT with Luxor?).",

    "section": "12.7 A Physical Derivation of Landau Damping",
    "text": "12.7 A Physical Derivation of Landau Damping\nWe are now in a position to derive the Landau damping rate recourse to contour integration. Although Landau’s derivation of collisionless damping was short and neat, it was not clear that it concerned a physically observable phenomenon until J. M. Dawson gave the longer, intuitive derivation which is paraphrased in this section. As before, we divide the plasma up into beams of velocity \\(u\\) and density \\(n_u\\), and examine their motion in a wave\n\\[\nE = E_1 \\sin(kx-\\omega t)\n\\]\nFrom the derivations in the previous section, the velocity of each beam is\n\\[\nv_1 = -\\frac{eE_1}{m}\\frac{\\cos(kx-\\omega t)}{\\omega-ku}\n\\]\nThis solution satisfies the equation of motion, but it does not satisfy the initial condition \\(v_1 = 0\\) at \\(t = 0\\). It is clear that this initial condition must be imposed; otherwise, \\(v_1\\) would be very large in the vicinity of \\(u=\\omega/k\\), and the plasma would be in a specially prepared state initially. We can fix up the solution to satisfy the initial condition by adding an arbitrary function of \\(kx-kut\\). The composite solution would still satisfy the equation of motion because the operator on the left-hand side, when applied to \\(f(kx-kut)\\), gives zero. Obviously, to get \\(v_1 = 0\\) at \\(t=0\\), the function \\(f(kx-kut)\\) must be taken to be \\(-\\cos(kx-kut)\\). Thus we have, instead of the expression above,\n\\[\nv_1 = \\frac{-eE_1}{m}\\frac{\\cos(kx-\\omega t) - \\cos(kx-kut)}{\\omega-ku}\n\\]\nNext, we must solve the equation of continuity for \\(n_1\\), again subject to the initial condition \\(n_1=0\\) at \\(t=0\\). Since we are now much cleverer than before, we may try a solution of the form\n\\[\nn_1 = \\bar{n}_1[\\cos(kx-\\omega t) - \\cos(kx-kut)]\n\\]\nInserting this into the equation of continuity and using the expression for \\(v_1\\) above, we find\n\\[\n\\bar{n}_1 \\sin(kx-\\omega t) = -n_u\\frac{eE_1 k}{m}\\frac{\\sin(kx-\\omega t) - \\sin(kx-kut)}{(\\omega - ku)^2}\n\\]\nApparently, we were not clever enough, since the \\(\\sin(kx-\\omega t)\\) factor does not cancel. To get a term of the form \\(\\sin(kx-kut)\\), which came from the added term in \\(v_1\\), we can add a term of the form \\(At\\sin(kx-kut)\\) to \\(n_1\\). This term obviously vanishes at \\(t=0\\), and it will give the \\(\\sin(kx-kut)\\) term when the operator on the left-hand side of the equation of continuity operates on the \\(t\\) factor. When the operator operates on the \\(\\sin(kx-kut)\\) factor, it yields zero. The coefficient \\(A\\) must be proportional to \\((\\omega-ku)^{-1}\\) in order to match the same factor in \\(\\partial v_1/\\partial x\\). Thus we take\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_1 =& -n_u\\frac{eE_1 k}{m}\\frac{1}{(\\omega-ku)^2} \\\\\n&\\times[\\cos(kx-\\omega t) - \\cos(kx-kut) - (\\omega - ku)t\\sin(kx-kut)]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis clearly vanishes at \\(t=0\\), and one can easily verify that it satisfies the equation of continuity.\nThese expressions for \\(v_1\\) and \\(n_1\\) allow us now to calculate the work done by the wave on each beam. The force acting on a unit volume of each beam is\n\\[\nF_u = -eE_q\\sin(kx-\\omega t)(n_u+n_1)\n\\]\nand therefore its energy changes at the rate\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t} = F_u(u+v_1) = -eE_1\\sin(kx-\\omega t)(\\underbrace{n_u u}_{1} +\\underbrace{n_uv_1}_{2} + \\underbrace{n_1 u}_{3} + \\underbrace{n_1 v_1}_{4})\n\\]\nWe now take the spatial average over a wavelength. The first term vanishes because \\(n_u u\\) is a constant. The fourth term can be neglected because it is second order, but in any case it can be shown to have zero average. The second and third terms can be evaluated with the help of identities\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left&lt; \\sin(kx-\\omega t)\\cos(kx-kut) \\right&gt; &= -\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\omega t-kut) \\\\\n\\left&lt; \\sin(kx-\\omega t)\\sin(kx-kut) \\right&gt; &= \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\omega t-kut)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe result is then\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left&lt; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt;_u = \\frac{e^2E_1^2}{2m}n_u\\Big[ &\\frac{\\sin(\\omega t - kut)}{\\omega - ku} \\\\\n& + ku\\frac{\\sin(\\omega t-kut) - (\\omega-ku)t\\cos(\\omega t-kut)}{(\\omega-ku)^2} \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe total work done on the particles is found by summing over all the beams:\n\\[\n\\sum_u \\left&lt; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt;_u = \\int \\frac{f_0(u)}{n_u}\\left&lt; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt;_u dy = n_0\\int\\frac{\\hat{f}_0(u)}{n_u}\\left&lt; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt;_u du\n\\]\nInserting the expression of \\(\\left&lt; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt;_u\\) and using the definition of \\(\\omega_p\\), we then find for the rate of change of kinetic energy\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left&lt; \\frac{dW_k}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt; =& \\frac{\\epsilon_0 E_1^2}{2}\\omega_p^2 \\Big[ \\int\\hat{f}_0(u)\\frac{\\sin(\\omega t - kut)}{\\omega - ku} du \\\\\n& + \\int\\hat{f}_0(u) \\frac{\\sin(\\omega t-kut) - (\\omega-ku)t\\cos(\\omega t-kut)}{(\\omega-ku)^2}ku du \\Big] \\\\\n=& \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_1^2 \\omega_p^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\hat{f}_0(u) du \\Big\\{ \\frac{\\sin(\\omega t - kut)}{\\omega - ku} + u\\frac{d}{du}\\Big[\\frac{\\sin(\\omega t - kut)}{\\omega - ku} \\Big] \\Big\\} \\\\\n=& \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_1^2 \\omega_p^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\hat{f}_0(u) du \\frac{d}{du}\\Big[u\\frac{\\sin(\\omega t - kut)}{\\omega - ku} \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is to be set equal to the rate of loss of wave energy density \\(W_w\\). The wave energy consists of two parts. The first part is the energy density of the electrostatic field:\n\\[\n\\left&lt; W_E \\right&gt; = \\frac{\\epsilon \\left&lt; E^2 \\right&gt;}{2} = \\frac{\\epsilon E_1^2}{4}\n\\]\nThe second part is the kinetic energy of oscillation of the particles.

Summing over the beams, we have\n\\[\n\\left&lt;\\Delta W_k \\right&gt; = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{e^2E_1^2}{m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f_0(u)}{(\\omega - ku)^2}\\Big[ 1+\\frac{2ku}{\\omega-ku} \\Big] du\n\\]\nThe second term in the brackets can be neglected in the limit \\(\\omega/k \\gg v_{th}\\), which we shall take in order to compare with our previous results. (???) The dispersion relation is found by Poisson’s equation:\n\\[\nk\\epsilon_0 E_1\\cos(kx-\\omega t) = -e\\sum_u n_1\n\\]\nUsing the expression for \\(n_1\\) in the previous section with the wrong initial conditions, we have\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m}\\sum_u \\frac{n_u}{(\\omega-ku)^2} = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f_0(u)du}{(\\omega-ku)^2}\n\\]\nComparing this with the expression of \\(\\left&lt; \\Delta W_k \\right&gt;\\), we find\n\\[\n\\left&lt; \\Delta W_k \\right&gt; = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{e^2E_1^2}{m}\\frac{\\epsilon_0 m}{e^2} = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 E_1^2}{4} = \\left&lt; W_E \\right&gt;\n\\]\nThus\n\\[\nW_w = \\frac{\\epsilon E_1^2}{2}\n\\]\nThe rate of change of wave energy density \\(W_w\\) is given by \\(-\\left&lt; \\frac{dW_k}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right&gt;\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dW_w}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -W_w \\omega_p^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\hat{f}_0(u) du \\frac{d}{du}\\Big[u\\frac{\\sin(\\omega t - kut)}{\\omega - ku} \\Big]\n\\]\nIntegration by parts gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dW_w}{\\mathrm{d}t} =& W_w \\omega_p^2 \\Big\\{ \\Big[ u\\hat{f}_0(u)\\frac{\\sin(\\omega-ku)t}{\\omega - ku} \\Big]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\\\\n&- \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u\\frac{d\\hat{f}_0}{du}\\frac{\\sin(\\omega-ku)t}{\\omega-ku} du \\Big\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe integrated part vanishes for well-behaved functions \\(\\hat{f}_0(u)\\), and we have\n\\[\n\\frac{dW_w}{\\mathrm{d}t} = W_w\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\omega_p^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d\\hat{f}_0}{du}\\Big[\\frac{\\sin(\\omega-ku)t}{\\omega-ku}\\Big] du\n\\]\nwhere \\(u\\) has been set equal to \\(\\omega/k\\) (a constant), since only velociies very close to this will contirbute to the integral. In fact, for sufficiently large \\(t\\), the square bracket can be approximated by a \\(\\delta\\)-function:\n\\[\n\\delta\\Big( u - \\frac{\\omega}{k}\\Big) = \\frac{k}{\\pi}\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\Big[ \\frac{\\sin(\\omega-ku) t}{\\omega-ku} \\Big]\n\\]\n(The original form is \\(\\delta(x) = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\sin(x/\\epsilon)}{\\pi x}\\), where the function on the right is called sinc.)\nThus\n\\[\n\\frac{dW_w}{\\mathrm{d}t} = W_w\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\omega_p^2 \\frac{\\pi}{k}\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\hat{f}_0\\Big(\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\Big) = W_w \\pi \\omega\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\hat{f}_0^\\prime\\Big(\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\Big)\n\\]\nSince \\(\\Im(\\omega)\\) is the growth rate of \\(E_1\\), and \\(W_w\\) is proportional to \\(E_1^2\\), we must have\n\\[\n\\frac{dW_w}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2\\Im(\\omega)W_w\n\\]\nHence\n\\[\n\\Im(\\omega) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\omega\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\hat{f}_0^\\prime\\Big(\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\Big)\n\\]\nin agreement with the previous result for \\(\\omega=\\omega_p\\).\n\n12.7.1 The Resonant Particles\nWe are now in a position to see precisely which are the resonant particles that contribute to linear Landau damping. Fig.7-25(Sinc function, ADD IT!) gives a plot of the factor multiplying \\(\\hat{f}_0^\\prime(u)\\) in the integrand. We see that the largest contribution comes from particles with \\(|\\omega - ku| &lt; \\pi/t\\), or \\(|v-v_\\phi| &lt; \\pi/k = \\lambda/2\\); i.e. those particles in the initial distribution that have not yet traveled a half-wavelength relative to the wave. The width of the central peak narrows with time, as expected. The subsidiary peaks in the “diffraction pattern” of Fig.7-25 come form particles that have traveled into neighboring half-wavelengths of the wave potential. These particles rapidly become spread out in phase, so that they contribute little on the average; the initial distribution is forgotten. Note that the width of the central peak is independent of the initial amplitude of the wave; hence, the resonant particles may include both trapped and untrapped particles. This phenomenon is unrelated to particle trapping.\n\n\n12.7.2 Two Paradoxes Resolved\nFig.7-25 shows that the integrand sinc function is an even function of \\(\\omega-ku\\), so that particles going both faster than the wave and slower than the wave add to Landau damping. This is the physical picture we found in Fig.7-24. On the other hand, the slope of the curve of Fig.7-25, which represents the factor in the integrand of one previous equation (WE NEED NUMBERING!), is an odd function of \\(\\omega-ku\\); and one would infer from this that particles traveling faster than the wave give energy to it, while those traveling slower than the wave take energy from it. The two descriptions differ by an integration by parts. Both descriptions are correct; which is to be chosen depends on whether one wishes to have \\(\\hat{f}_0(u)\\) or \\(\\hat{f}_0(u)^\\prime\\) in the integrand.\nA second paradox concerns the question of Galilean invariance. If we take the view that damping requires there be fewer particles traveling faster than the wave than slower, there is no problem as long as one is in the frame in which the plasma is at rest. However, if one goes into another frame moving with a velocity \\(V\\), there would appear to be more particles moving faster than the wave than slower, and one would expect the wave to grow instead of decay. This paradox is removed by reinserting the second term in Eq.(???) \\(\\frac{2ku}{\\omega-ku}\\) which we neglected. As shown in the previous section, this term can make \\(\\left&lt; \\Delta W_k \\right&gt;\\) negative. Indeed, in the moving frame, the second term is not negligible, \\(\\left&lt; \\Delta W_k \\right&gt;\\) is negative, and the wave appears to have negative energy (that is, there is more energy in the quiescent, drifting Maxwellian distribution than in the presence of an oscillation). The wave “grows”, but adding energy to a negative energy wave makes its amplitude decrease.",

    "text": "12.8 BGK and Van Kampen Modes\nWe have seen that Landau damping is directly connected to the requirement that \\(f_0(v)\\) be initially uniform in space. (It tends to make negative slopes to zero.) On the other hand, one can generate undamped electron waves if \\(f(v, t=0)\\) is mode to be constant along the particle trajectories initially. (???) It is easy to from Fig.7-24 that the particles will neither gain nor lose energy, on the average, if the plasma is initially prepared so that the density is constant along each trajectory. Such a wave is called a BGK mode, since it was I. B. Bernstein, J. M. Greene, and M. D. Kruskal who first showed that undamped waves of arbitrary \\(\\omega\\), \\(k\\), amplitude, and waveform were possible. The crucial parameter to adjust in tailoring \\(f(v,t=0)\\) to form a BGK mode is the relative number of trapped and untrappped particles. If we take the small-amplitude limit of a BGK mode, we obtain what is called a Van Kampen mode. In this limit, only the particles with \\(v=v_\\phi\\) are trapped. We can change the number of trapped particles by adding to \\(f(v,t=0)\\) a term proportional to \\(\\delta(v-v_\\phi)\\). Examination of Fig.7-24 will show that adding particles along the line \\(v=v_\\phi\\) will not cause damping — at a later time, there are just as many particles gaining energy as losing energy. In fact, by choosing distributions with \\(\\delta\\)-functions at other values of \\(v_\\phi\\), one can generate undamped Van Kampen modes of arbitrary \\(v_\\phi\\). Such sungular initial conditions are, however, not physical. To get a smoothly varying \\(f(v,t=0)\\), one must sum over Van Kampen modes with a distribution of \\(v_\\phi s\\). Although each mode is undamped, the total perturbation will show Landau damping because the various modes get out of phase with one another. (???)",

    "section": "12.9 Ion Landau Damping",
    "text": "12.9 Ion Landau Damping\nElectrons are not the only resonant particles. If a wave has a slow enough phase velocity to match the thermal velocity of ions, ion Landau damping can occur. The ion acoustic wave, for instance, is greatly affected by Landau damping. Recall from the fluid theory that the dispersion relation for ion waves is \\[\n\\frac{\\omega}{k} = v_s = \\Big( \\frac{k_BT_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i} \\Big)^{1/2}\n\\]\nIf \\(T_e \\le T_i\\), the phase velocity lies in the region where \\(f_{0i}(v)\\) has a negative slope, as shown in Fig.7-30(A)(ADD IT!!!). Consequently, ion waves are heavily Landau-damped if \\(T_e \\le T_i\\). Ion waves are observable only if \\(T_e \\gg T_i\\)(Fig.7-30(B)), so that the phase velocity lies far in the tail of the ion velocity distribution. A clever way to introduce Landau damping in a controlled manner was employed by Alexeff, Jones, and Montgomery. A weakly damped ion wave was created in a heavy-ion plasma (such as xenon) with \\(T_e \\gg T_i\\). A small amount of a light atom (helium) was then added. Since the helium had about the temperature as the xenon but had much smaller mass, its distribution function was much broader, as shown by the dashed curve in Fig.7-30(B). The resonant helium ions then caused the wave to damp.\n\n12.9.1 The Plasma Dispersion Function\nTo introduce some of the standard terminlogy of kinetic theory, we now calculate the ion Landau damping of ion acoustic waves in the absence of magnetic fields. Ions and electrons follow the Vlasov equation and have perturbations of the form \\(f_1\\propto\\exp(ikx-i\\omega t)\\) indicating plane waves propagating in the x direction. The solution for \\(f_1\\) is given by the linearized momentum equation with appropriate modifications: \\[\nf_{1j} = -\\frac{iq_jE}{m_j}\\frac{\\partial f_{oj}/\\partial v_j}{\\omega-kv_j}\n\\] where \\(E\\) and \\(v_j\\) stand for \\(E_x, v_{xj}\\); and the \\(j\\)th species has charge \\(q_j\\), mass \\(m_j\\), and particle velocity \\(v_j\\). The density perturbation of the \\(j\\)th species is given by \\[\nn_{1j} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f_{1j}(v_j)dv_j = -\\frac{iq_jE}{m_j}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial f_{oj}/\\partial v_j}{\\omega-kv_j}dv_j\n\\]\nLet the equilibrium distributions \\(f_{0j}\\) be one-dimensional Maxwellians: \\[\nf_{0j} = \\frac{n_{0j}}{v_{thj}\\pi^{1/2}}e^{-v_j^2/v_{th}^2},\\quad v_{thj}\\equiv (2k_B T_j/m_j)^{1/2}\n\\]\nIntroducing the dummy integration variable \\(s = v_j/v_{thj}\\), we can write \\(n_{1j}\\) as \\[\nn_{1j} = \\frac{iq_j E n_{0j}}{km_j v_{thj}^2}\\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{(d/ds)(e^{-s^2})}{s -\\zeta_j}ds\n\\] where \\[\n\\zeta\\equiv \\omega/k v_{thj}\n\\]\nWe now define the plasma dispersion function \\(Z(\\zeta)\\): \\[\nZ(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-s^2}}{s -\\zeta}ds\\quad \\Im(\\zeta)&gt;0\n\\tag{12.33}\\]\n(Why positive imaginary part???)This is a contour integral, as explained in previous sections, and analytic continuation to the lower half plane must be used if \\(\\Im(\\zeta)&lt;0\\). \\(Z(\\zeta)\\) is a complex function of a complex argument (since \\(\\omega\\) or \\(k\\) usually has an imaginary part). In cases where \\(Z(\\zeta)\\) cannot be approximated by an asymptotic formula, one can do it numerically.\nTo express \\(n_{1j}\\) in terms of \\(Z(\\zeta)\\), we take the derivative with respect to \\(\\zeta\\): \\[\nZ^\\prime(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-s^2}}{(s -\\zeta)^2}ds\n\\]\nIntegration by parts yields \\[\nZ^\\prime(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/2}}\\Big[ \\frac{-e^{-s^2}}{s-\\zeta} \\Big]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} + \\frac{1} {\\pi^{1/2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{(d/ds)(e^{-s^2})}{s -\\zeta}ds\n\\]\nThe first term vanishes, as it must for any well-behaved distribution function. Now we have \\[\nn_{1j} = \\frac{iq_j E n_{0j}}{km_j v_{thj}^2}Z^\\prime(\\zeta_j)\n\\]\nPoisson’s equation is \\[\n\\epsilon\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = ik\\epsilon_0E = \\sum_j q_j n_{1j}\n\\]\nCombining the last two equations, separating out the electron term explicitly, and defining \\[\n\\Omega_{pj}\\equiv(n_{oj}Z_j^2 e^2/\\epsilon_0 m_j)^{1/2}\n\\]\nWe obtain the dispersion relation \\[\nk^2 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{v_{the}^2}Z^\\prime(\\zeta_e) + \\sum_j\\frac{\\Omega_{pj}^2}{v_{thj}^2}Z^\\prime(\\zeta_j)\n\\]\nElectron plasma waves can be obtained by setting \\(\\Omega_{pj}=0\\) (infinitely massive ions). Defining \\[\nk_D^2 = 2\\omega_p^2/v_{the}^2 = \\lambda_D^{-2}\n\\] we then obtain \\[\nk/k_D^2 = \\frac{1}{2}Z^\\prime(\\zeta_e)\n\\] which is the same as Equation 12.30 when \\(f_{0e}\\) is Maxwellian.\n\n\n12.9.2 Ion Waves and Their Damping\nTo obtain ion waves, go back to the plasma dispersion relation and use the fact that their phase velocity \\(\\omega/k\\) is much smaller than \\(v_{the}\\); hence \\(\\zeta_e\\) is small, and we can expand \\(Z(\\zeta_e)\\) in a power series: \\[\nZ(\\zeta_e) = i\\sqrt{\\pi}e^{-\\zeta_e^2} - 2\\zeta_e(1-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta_e^2 + ...)\n\\]\nThe imaginary term comes from the residue at a pole lying near the real \\(s\\) axis and represents electron Landau damping. For \\(\\zeta_e \\ll 1\\), the derivative of the above gives \\[\nZ^\\prime(\\zeta_e) = -2i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta_e e^{-\\zeta_e^2} - 2 + ... \\simeq -2\n\\]\nElectron Landau damping can usually be neglected in ion waves because the slope of \\(f_e(v)\\) is small near its peak. Replacing \\(Z^\\prime(\\zeta_e)\\) by -2 in the dispersion relation gives \\[\n\\lambda_D\\sum_j \\frac{\\Omega_{pj}^2}{v_{thj}^2}Z^\\prime(\\zeta_j) = 1+k^2\\lambda_D^2 \\simeq 1\n\\]\nThe term \\(k^2\\lambda_D^2\\) represents the deviation from quasineutrality. (\\(1/k\\sim L,k^2\\lambda_D^2 \\sim\\lambda_D^2/L^2\\ll 1\\) where \\(L\\) is the system length scale.)\nWe now specialize tothe case of a single ion species. Since \\(n_{0e}=Z_in_{0i}\\), the coefficient in the equation above is \\[\n\\lambda_D\\frac{\\Omega_{p}^2}{v_{thi}^2}=\\frac{\\epsilon k_B T_e}{n_{0e}e^2}\\frac{n_{0i}Z^2e^2}{\\epsilon m_i}\\frac{m_i}{2k_B T_i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{ZT_e}{T_i}\n\\]\nFor \\(k_2\\lambda_D^2\\ll 1\\), the dispersion relation becomes \\[\nZ^\\prime(\\frac{\\omega}{kv_{thi}}) = \\frac{2T_i}{ZT_e}\n\\]\nSolving this equation is a nontrivial problem. Suppose we take real \\(k\\) and complex \\(\\omega\\) to study damping in time. Then the real and imaginary parts of \\(\\omega\\) must be adjusted so that \\(\\Im(Z^\\prime)=0\\) and \\(\\Re(Z^\\prime) = 2T_i/ZT_e\\). There are in general many possible roots \\(\\omega\\) that satisfy this, all of them having \\(\\Im(\\omega)&lt;0\\). The least damped, dominant root is the one having the smallest \\(|\\Im(\\omega)|\\). Damping in space is usually treated by taking \\(\\omega\\) real and \\(k\\) complex. Again we get a series of roots \\(k\\) with \\(\\Im(k)&gt;0\\), representing spatial damping. However, the dominant root does not correspond to the same value of \\(\\zeta_i\\) as in the complex \\(\\omega\\) case. It turns out that the spatial problem has to be treated with special attention to the excitation mechanism at the boundaries and with more careful treatment of the electron term \\(Z^\\prime(\\zeta_e)\\).\nTo obtain an analytic result, we consider the limit \\(\\zeta_i \\gg 1\\), corresponding to large temperature ratio \\(\\theta\\equiv ZT_e/T_i\\). (???) The asymptotic expression for \\(Z^\\prime(\\zeta_i)\\) is \\[\nZ^\\prime(\\zeta_i) = -2i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta_i e^{-\\zeta_i^2} + \\zeta_i^{-2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\zeta_i^{-4} + ...\n\\]\n(I think this can be found from the plasma handbook; it can also be found here) If the damping is small, we cna neglect the Landau term in the first approximation. The equation becomes \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\zeta_i^2}\\Big( 1+\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{1}{\\zeta_i^2} \\Big) = \\frac{2}{\\theta}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\theta\\) is assumed large, \\(\\zeta_i^2\\) is large; and we can approximate \\(\\zeta_i^2\\) by \\(\\theta/2\\) in the second term. Thus \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\zeta_i^2}\\Big( 1+\\frac{3}{\\theta} \\Big) = \\frac{2}{\\theta},\\quad \\zeta_i^2 = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{\\theta}{2}\n\\] or \\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2} = \\frac{2k_B T_i}{m_i}\\Big( \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{ZT_e}{2T_i} \\Big) = \\frac{Zk_B T_e + 3k_B T_i}{m_i}\n\\]\nThis is the ion wave dispersion relation with \\(\\gamma_i=3\\), generalized to arbitrary \\(Z\\).\nWe now substitue the above approximations back into the dispersion relation retaining the Landau term: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\zeta_i^2}\\Big( 1+\\frac{3}{\\theta} \\Big) - 2i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta_i e^{-\\zeta_i^2} = \\frac{2}{\\theta} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\zeta_i^2}\\Big( 1+\\frac{3}{\\theta} \\Big) = \\frac{2}{\\theta}(1+i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\theta\\zeta_i e^{-\\zeta_i^2}) \\\\\n\\zeta_i^2 = \\Big(\\frac{3+\\theta}{2}\\Big)^{1/2}(1+i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\theta\\zeta_i e^{-\\zeta_i^2})^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nExpanding the square root, we have \\[\n\\zeta_i \\simeq \\Big(\\frac{3+\\theta}{2}\\Big)^{1/2}\\Big(1-\\frac{1}{2}i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\theta\\zeta_i e^{-\\zeta_i^2}\\Big)\n\\]\nThe approximate damping rate is found by using the above approximation in the imaginary term: \\[\n-\\frac{\\Im(\\zeta_i)}{\\Re(\\zeta_i)} = \\frac{\\Im(\\omega)}{\\Re(\\omega)} = \\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{8} \\Big)^{1/2}\\theta (3+\\theta)^{1/2} e^{-(3+\\theta)/2}\n\\]\nThis asymptotic expression, accurate for large \\(\\theta\\), shows an exponential decrease in damping with increasing \\(\\theta\\). When \\(\\theta\\) falls below 10, this expression becomes inacuurate, and the damping must be computed from the original expression which employs the Z-function. For the experimentally interesting region \\(1&lt;\\theta&lt;10\\), the following simple formula is ananalytic fit to the exact solution: \\[\n-\\Im(\\omega)/\\Re(\\omega) = 1.1\\theta^{7/4}\\exp(-\\theta^2)\n\\]\nWhat happens when collisions are added to ion Landau damping? Surprisingly little. Ion-electron collisions are weak because the ion and electron fluids move almost in unison, creating little friction between them. Ion-ion collisions (ion viscosity) can damp ion acoustic waves, but we know that sound waves in air can propagate well in spite of the dominance of collisions. Actually, collisions spoil the particle resonances that cause Landau damping, and one finds that the total damping is less than the Landau damping unless the collision rate is extremely large. In summary, ion Landau damping is almost always the dominant process with ion waves, and this varies exponentially with the ratio \\(ZT_e/T_i\\).",

The linearized equation is then replaced by \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f_1}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla f_1 +\\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0)\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} = -\\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{E}_1 + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1)\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}\n\\tag{12.34}\\]\nResonant particles moving along \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) still cause Landau damping if \\(\\omega/k\\simeq v_{th}\\), but two new kinetic effects now appear which are connected with the velocity component \\(\\mathbf{v}_\\perp\\) perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\). One of these is cyclotron damping, which will be discussed later; the other is the generation of cyclotron harmonics, leading to the possibility of the oscillation commonly called Bernstein waves.\nHarmonics of the cyclotron frequency are generated when the particles’ circular Larmor orbits are distorted by the wave fields \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\). These finite-\\(r_L\\) effects are neglected in ordinary fluid theory but can be taken into account to order \\(k^2r_L^2\\) by including the viscosity. A kinetic treatment can be accurate even for \\(k^2r_L^2 = \\mathcal{O}(1)\\). To understand how harmonics aris, consider the motion of a particle in an electric field: \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = E_x e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n\\]\nThe equation of motion is \\[\n\\ddot{x} + \\omega_c^2 x = \\frac{1}{m}E_x e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\n\\]\nIf \\(kr_L\\) is not small, the exponent varies from one side of the orbit to the other. We can approximate \\(kx\\) by substituting the undisturbed orbit \\(x=r_L\\sin\\omega_c t\\) \\[\n\\ddot{x} + \\omega_c^2 x = \\frac{1}{m}E_x e^{i(kr_L\\sin\\omega_c t-\\omega t)}\n\\]\nThe generating function for the Bessel function \\(J_n(z)\\) is \\[\ne^{z(t-1/t)/2} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} t^n J_n(z)\n\\]\nLetting \\(z=kr_L\\) and \\(t = \\exp(i\\omega_c t)\\), we obtain \\[\ne^{ikr_L\\sin\\omega_c t} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(kr_L) e^{in\\omega_c t}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\ddot{x} + \\omega_c^2 x = \\frac{q}{m}E_x \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}J_n(kr_L) e^{i(\\omega-n\\omega_c) t}\n\\]\nThe following solution can be verified by direct substitution: \\[\nx = \\frac{q}{m}E_x \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{J_n(kr_L)e^{i(\\omega-n\\omega_c) t}}{\\omega_c^2 - (\\omega - n\\omega_c)^2}\n\\]\nThis shows that the motion has frequency components differing from the driving frequency by multiples of \\(\\omega_c\\), and that the amplitudes of these components are proportional to \\(J_n(kr_L)/[\\omega_c^2 - (\\omega - n\\omega_c)^2]\\). When the denominator vanishes, the amplitude becomes large. This happens when \\(\\omega-n\\omega_c = \\pm \\omega_c\\), or \\(\\omega=(n\\pm 1)\\omega_c,\\ n=0,\\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...\\); that is, when the field \\(\\mathbf{E}(x,t)\\) resonates with any harmonic of \\(\\omega_c\\). In the fluid limit \\(kr_L\\rightarrow 0\\), \\(J_n(kr_L)\\) can be approximated by \\((kr_L/2)^n/n!\\), which approaches 0 for all \\(n\\) except \\(n=0\\). For \\(n=0\\), the coefficient becomes \\((\\omega_c^2-\\omega^2)^{-1}\\), which is the fluid result containing only the fundamental cyclotron frequency.\n\n12.10.1 The Hot Plasma Dielectric Tensor\nAfter Fourier analysis of \\(f_1(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)\\) in space and time, the linearized Vlasov equation can be solved for a Maxwellian distribution \\(f_0(\\mathbf{v})\\), and the resulting expression \\(f_1(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{v},\\omega)\\) can be used to calculate the density and current of each species. The result is usually expressed in the form of an equivalent dielectric tensor \\(\\overleftrightarrow{\\epsilon}\\), such that the dispersion vector \\(\\mathbf{D}=\\overleftrightarrow{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\) can be used in the Maxwell’s equations to calculate dispersion relations for various waves. The algebra is horrendous and therefore omitted. We quote only a restricted result valid for nonrelativistic plasmas with isotropic pressure \\(T_\\perp = T_\\parallel\\) and no zero-order drifts \\(\\mathbf{v}_{0j}\\); these restrictions are easily removed, but he general formulas are too cluttered for our purposes. We further assume \\(\\mathbf{k} = k_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\), with \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\) being the direction of \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\); no generality is lost by setting \\(k_y\\) equal to zero, since the plasma is isotropic in the plane perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\). The elements of \\(\\overleftrightarrow{\\epsilon}_R = \\overleftrightarrow{\\epsilon}/\\epsilon_0\\) are then\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon_{xx} &= \\\\\n\\epsilon_{yy} &= \\\\\n\\epsilon_{zz} &= \\\\\n\\epsilon_{xz} &= \\\\\n\\epsilon_{yz} &= \\\\\n\\epsilon_{zx} &=\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(Z(\\zeta)\\) is the plasma dispersion function, \\(I_n(b)\\) is the \\(n\\)th order Bessel function of imaginary argument, and the other symbols are defined by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{ps}^2 &= n_{0s} Z_s^2 e^2 / \\epsilon_0 m_s \\\\\n\\zeta_s &= (\\omega+n\\omega_{cs})/k_z v_{ths} \\\\\n\\omega_{cs} &= |Z_seB_0/m_s| \\\\\nv_{ths}^2 &= 2k_B T_s/m_s \\\\\nb_s &= \\frac{1}{2}k_\\perp^2 r_{Ls} = k_x^2 k_B T_s / m_s \\omega_{cs}^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe first sum is over species \\(s\\), with the understanding that \\(\\omega_p, b, \\zeta_0\\), and \\(\\zeta_n\\) all depend on \\(s\\), and that the \\(\\pm\\) stands for the sign of the charge. The second sum is over the harmonic number \\(n\\). The primes indicate differentiation with respect to the argument.\nAs foreseen, there appear Bessel functions of finite-\\(r_L\\) parameter \\(b\\). (The change from \\(J_n(b)\\) to \\(I_n(b)\\) occurs in the integration over velocities.) The elements of \\(\\overleftrightarrow{\\epsilon}\\) involving motion along \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\) contain \\(Z^\\prime(\\zeta_n)\\), which gives rise to Landau damping when \\(n=0\\) and \\(\\omega/k_z\\simeq v_{th}\\). The \\(n\\neq 0\\) terms now make possible another collisionless damping mechanism, cyclotron damping, which occurs when \\((\\omega_c \\pm n\\omega_c)/k_z\\simeq v_{th}\\).\n\n\n12.10.2 Bernstein Waves\nElectrostatic waves propagating at right angles to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) at harmonics of the cyclotron frequency are called Bernstein waves. The dispersion relation can be found by using the dielectric elements give in the previous section in Poisson’s equation \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=0\\). If we assume electrostatic perturbations such that \\(\\mathbf{E}_1=-\\nabla\\phi_0\\), and consider waves of the form \\(\\phi_1=\\phi_1\\exp i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)\\), Poisson’s equation can be written\n\\[\nk_x^2 \\epsilon_{xx} + 2k_x k_z \\epsilon_{xz} + k_z^2 \\epsilon_{zz} = 0\n\\]\nNote that we have chosen a coordinate system that has \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) lying in the x-z plane, so that \\(k_y=0\\). We next substitute for \\(\\epsilon_{xx},\\epsilon_{xz}\\), and \\(\\epsilon_{zz}\\) from the dielectric tensor expression and express \\(Z^\\prime(\\zeta_n)\\) in terms of \\(Z(\\zeta_n)\\) with the identity\n\\[\nZ^\\prime(\\zeta_n) = -2[1+\\zeta Z(\\zeta_n)]\n\\]\nvia integration by parts. The equation becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nk_x^2 + &k_z^2 + \\sum_s\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}e^{-b}\\zeta_0 \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} I_n(b) \\\\\n&\\times \\big[ k_x^2\\frac{n^2}{b}Z - 2\\big(\\frac{2}{b}\\big)^{1/2}nk_xk_z(1+\\zeta_n Z)-2k_z^2 \\zeta_n(1+\\zeta_n Z) \\big] = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe expression in the square brackets can be simplified in a few algebraic steps to \\(2k_z^2[\\zeta_{-n} + \\zeta_0^2 Z(\\zeta_n)]\\) by using the definitions \\(b = k_x^2 v_{th}^2/2\\omega_c^2\\) and \\(\\zeta_n=(\\omega+n\\omega_c)/k_zv_{th}\\). Further noticing that \\(2k_z^2 \\omega_p^2 \\zeta_0/\\omega^2 = 2\\omega_p^2/v_{th}^2\\equiv k_D^2\\) for each species, we can write the equation as\n\\[\nk_x^2 + k_z^2 + \\sum_s k_D^2 e^{-b}\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} I_n(b)[\\zeta_{-n}/\\zeta_0 + \\zeta_0 Z(\\zeta_n)] = 0\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\zeta_{-n}/\\zeta_0=1-n\\omega_c/\\omega\\). Since \\(I_n(b)=I_{-n}(b)\\), the term \\(I_n(b)n\\omega_c/\\omega\\) sums to zero when \\(n\\) goes from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\); hence, \\(\\zeta_{-n}/\\zeta_0\\) can be replaced by 1. Defining \\(k^2 = k_x^2 + k_z^2\\), we obtain the general dispersion relation for Bernstein waves:\n\\[\n1+ \\sum_s\\frac{k_D^2}{k_\\perp^2}e^{-b}\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} I_n(b)[1 + \\zeta_0 Z(\\zeta_n)] = 0\n\\]\n\nElectron Bernstein Waves. Let us first consider high-frequency waves in which the ions do not move. These waves are not sensitive to small deviations from perpendicular propagation, and we may set \\(k_z=0\\), so that \\(\\zeta_n\\rightarrow\\infty\\). There is, therefore, no cyclotron damping; the gaps in the spectrum that we shall find are not caused by such damping. For large \\(\\zeta_n\\), we may replace \\(Z(\\zeta_n)\\) by \\(-1/\\zeta_n\\). (???) The \\(n=0\\) term in teh second sum of the above equation then cancels out, and we can divide the sum into two sums, as follows:\n\n\\[\nk_\\perp^2 + \\sum_s k_D^2 e^{-b}\\Big[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(b)(1 - \\zeta_0 /\\zeta_n) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_{-n}(b)(1 - \\zeta_0 /\\zeta_{-n})\\Big] = 0\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nk_\\perp^2 + \\sum_s k_D^2 e^{-b}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(b)\\Big[ 2-\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega+n\\omega_c} - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega-n\\omega_c} \\Big] = 0\n\\]\nThe bracket collapses to a single term upon combining over a common denominator:\n\\[\n1 = \\sum_s \\frac{k_D^2}{k_\\perp^2}e^{-b}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty I_n(b)\\frac{2n^2\\omega_c^2}{\\omega^2 - n^2\\omega_c^2}\n\\]\nUsing the definitions of \\(k_D\\) and \\(b\\), one obtains the well-known (NOT TO ME!!!) \\(k_z=0\\) dispersion relation\n\\[\n1 = \\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega_c^2}\\frac{2}{b}e^{-b}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{I_n(b)}{(\\omega/n\\omega_c)^2-1}\n\\]\nWe now specialize to the case of electron oscillations. Dropping the sum over species, we obtain\n\\[\n\\frac{k_\\perp^2}{k_D^2} = 2\\omega_c^2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-b}I_n(b)}{\\omega^2 - n\\omega_c^2}n^2 \\equiv \\alpha(\\omega, b)\n\\]\n… (ADD fig.7-33!!!)\nTo obtain the fluid limit, we repalce \\(I_n(b)\\) by its small-\\(b\\) value \\((b/2)^n/n!\\). Only the \\(n=1\\) term remains in the limit \\(b\\rightarrow 0\\), and we obtain\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega_c^2}\\frac{2}{b}\\frac{b}{2}\\Big( \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_c^2} - 1\\Big)^{-1} = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2 - \\omega_c^2}\n\\]\nor \\(\\omega^2 = \\omega_p^2 + \\omega_c^2 = \\omega_h^2\\), which is the upper hybrid oscillation. As \\(k_\\perp\\rightarrow 0\\), this frequency must be one of the roots. If \\(\\omega_h\\) falls between two high harmonics of \\(\\omega_c\\), the shape of the \\(\\omega-k\\) curves changes near \\(\\omega = \\omega_h\\) to allow this to occur. …\n\nIon Bernstein Waves. In the case of waves at ion cyclotron harmonics, one has to distinguish between pure ion Bernstein waves, for which \\(k_z=0\\), and neutralized ion Bernstein waves, for which \\(k_z\\) has a small but finite value. The difference, as we have seen earlier for lower hybrid oscillations, is that finite \\(k_z\\) allows electrons to flow along \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) to cancel charge separations. Though the \\(k_z=0\\) case has already been treated in …\n\n\n\n\n\nChen, Francis F. 2016. Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion. Vol. 1.

    "text": "13.2 Implication of Single Particle Motion on Instabilities\nThis section provides some qualitative understanding of instabilities in plasma. Thinking of instabilities from the prospective of single particle motion provides us the physical intuition of the causes and development of instabilities from a very basic level.\n\n13.2.1 Equilibrium stability of a plasma from drifts\nA key problem in nuclear fusion is to confine plasma. In the first stage, we need current loops around a torus tube (ADD FIGURE!) to provide a toroidal magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}_t\\) along the torus. Let us take a look at a torus cut. (ADD FIGURE!) \\(\\nabla B_0\\) is pointing towards the inside. \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) points outside the plane, so the gradient-curvature drift will lead electrons upward and ions downward, which in turn creates a E field pointing upwards. \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift then will lead both electrons and ions towards the outer boundary. Eventually we will lose the plasma. One way to fix this is to add \\(\\mathbf{J}_t\\), an internal plasma current in the toroidal direction to generate a poloidal \\(\\mathbf{B}_p\\), so that the magnetic field is stronger on the boundary than that at the center. In this way the total magnetic field becomes a helix.\nConsider the poloidal magnetic field generated by \\(\\mathbf{J}_t\\). One step further, our question is: will the plasma tube be stable under infinitesimal perturbations to the ideal cylinder configuration? The answer is no. Imagine a small perturbation shown as in Figure 13.1 b. \\(\\nabla B\\) points from weak B to strong B regions. On the convex side, the gradient-curvature drift will lead ions to the left and electrons to the right, which in turn generates an electric field pointing left to right. Thereafter the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift will further drag the plasma to the convex region, and the whole system can never return to equilibrium. This the current-carrying plasma instability is called kink instability. The situation described here is sometimes referred to as linear kink instability. The kink mode can carry currents. Another similar mode is the sausage instability as shown in Figure 13.1. Also note that a sufficiently strong \\(B_z\\) (not poloidal/toroidal component) can stabilize these instabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Sausage and kink modes.\n\n\n\nAnother famous instability is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In fluid dynamics, Rayleigh-Taylor instability happens due to gravity. Here in plasma physics, the role of gravity force is replaced by the electromagnetic force. Imagine a situation where plasma are located at \\(z&gt;0\\) region, below which is a vacuum space. There is a B field pointing outside the plane while \\(\\nabla B\\) is pointing upwards (\\(B_{\\text{up}}&gt;B_{\\text{down}}\\)). Due to gradient drift on the boundary, ions will move to the left while electrons will move to the right, where a E field pointing left to right is created. Thus the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift will lead plasma from upper region to lower region, and eventually breaks the interface. (Actually I have some questions for this figure: it seems to me that it is impossible to decide which part of the interface is changing first?)\n\n\n13.2.2 Stability of magnetic mirror in the scope of single particle motion\nWe can deduce the stability of magnetic mirror by assuming a initial small perturbation along the boundary. In the center cross-section cut, first there is a centrifugal force pointing outward, which will cause electrons drifting to one way and ions drifting to the other way. The charge separation will generate an electric field. The \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift will then pull the plasma further out if there’s a ripple, which will lead to instability. Several names describe the same thing: flute instability, R-T instability, interchangeable instability, gravitational instability and so on. This instability propagates at Alfvén speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Basic magnetic mirror configuration.\n\n\n\nIn general, we can define two configuration categories: the unstable situation, where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) has a “bad” unfavorable curvature, and the stable situation, where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) has a “good” favorable curvature. This depends on whether or not the magnetic pressure in the vacuum is stronger than that inside the plasma. In a basic magnetic mirror, the plasma on the center boundaries are unstable, while those around the coil curvature are stable.\nA famous Russian scientist Ioffe introduced conducting bars around the mirror to create an absolute minimum B-geometry, where in any point away from the center the B field is stronger. This indeed supresses the R-T instability, but the whole system is, unfortunately, still unstable due to microinstabilities caused by lost cone distribution. The inverted population (more high speed particles than low speed ones) will lead to instabilities. Later scientists came up with the idea of adding cold gas to modify the distribution, but the cold gas injection procedure eventually kills the mirror configuration.\n\n\n13.2.3 Stability in the Tokamak\nIn a classical Tokamak geometry, the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field together created a spiral around the torus. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{B}_T+\\mathbf{B}_P \\\\\nB=\\sqrt{{B_T}^2+{B_P}^2}\\approx B_T\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe field strength goes down as \\(R\\) increases, which implies that the inner semi-tube is in good curvature and the outer semi-tube is in bad curvature. By plotting mechanical potential=\\(\\mu B\\) along the B-line as a function of \\(\\theta\\), we can see that there are bumps and valleys. Particles with low \\(v_\\parallel\\) are trapped, and those with large \\(v_\\parallel\\) are transit particles. Tokamak is an average minimum B geometry, because particles spend longer time on hills (stable region) and less time in valleys (unstable region). This geometry is not as robust as Ioffe bar magnetic mirror, since some particles with small \\(v_\\parallel\\) are always trapped in bad curvature region.\nSee more in (Chen 2016), Third Edition, Chapter Application of Plasmas.",

Let \\(|\\pmb{\\epsilon}|=0\\). we finally obtain the dispersion relation. For an isotropic case, the dielectric tensor shrinks to a scalar, so we simply have \\(\\epsilon=0\\).\n\nAssume the simple equilibrium state in 1D (static and “cold” ions, “cold” electrons): \\(m_i=\\infty,E_0=B_0=0, p_i=p_e=0, n_i = n_0, T_e=T_i=0\\). Whenever we say “cold” for plasma, it does not mean that the plasma is at absolute zero degree. This only means that we are considering a situation where the kinetic pressure plays no roles in the dispersion relation. This is also a non-magnetized plasma because \\(\\mathbf{B_0} = 0\\). The variables including perturbations are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_e &= n_0+n_1 \\quad n_0\\gg n_1\\\\\nv_e &= v_0+v_1 \\quad v_0\\gg v_1 \\\\\nE &= \\cancel{E}_0 +E_1 \\\\\nn_1(x,t)&=\\tilde{n}_1e^{-i\\omega t+ikx}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe electron continuity and the momentum equations read \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(n_0+n_1)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[(n_0+n_1)(v_0+v_1)\\big]=0 \\\\\n&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(v_0+v_1)+(v_0+v_1)\\frac{\\partial(v_0+v_1)}{\\partial x}=-\\frac{e}{m_e}\\big[ (E_0+E_1)+(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1)\\times(\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_1)_x \\big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAgain, for electrostatic waves, \\(\\mathbf{B}_1=0\\).

In consideration of linear superposition property, we expect the dielectric function to be \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{p1}}^2}{(\\omega-kv_1)^2}-\\frac{{\\omega_{p2}}^2}{(\\omega-kv_2)^2}\n\\]\nIf \\(g(v)\\) is a continuous distribution in general, \\(g(v)=\\sum_j g_j(v)\\), then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}&=1-\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sum_j \\frac{{\\omega_{p,j}}^2 g_j(v)\\mathrm{d}v}{(\\omega-kv)^2} \\\\ &=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{g(v)\\mathrm{d}v}{(v-\\omega/k)^2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that \\(\\delta^\\prime(x) = x^{-1}\\delta(x)\\). Here we reconstruct the result of Vlasov theory from 2-fluid theory. The equivalence of the two approaches is explored more thoroughly in later section Fluid Descriptions of Kinetic Modes (ADD LINK!).\nThen what happens if ion motion is included? We still have “cold” ions at rest in equilibrium but now with ion perturbations in density. The Poisson’s equation should include ion density perturbation \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_1)&=\\sum_{j=i,e} q_j n_{1j} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}&=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}v \\frac{\\partial g_e(v)/\\partial v}{v-\\omega/k}-\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{k^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}v \\frac{\\partial g_i(v)/\\partial v}{v-\\omega/k}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the simplest equilibrium case, \\(g_e(v)=\\delta(v-v_0),\\ g_i(v)=\\delta(v)\\) \\[\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=1-\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\\omega-kv_0)^2}-\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{\\omega^2}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\epsilon=0\\), we get the dispersion relation \\(\\omega=\\omega(k)\\). An example dispersion relation and dielectric function property are shown in Figure 13.3 and Figure 13.4, respectively. Note that if you have a real wave number \\(k\\), you will get a pair of conjugate \\(\\omega\\), one of which that lies between \\(0\\) and \\(kv_0\\) is an unstable mode.

    "section": "13.4 Rayleigh-Taylor Instability",
    "text": "13.4 Rayleigh-Taylor Instability\nThe Rayleigh-Taylor instability is probably the most important MHD instability. It is also called gravitational instability , flute instability or more generally, interchange instability. In ordinary hydrodynamics, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability arises when one attempts to support a heavy fluid on top of a light fluid: the interface becomes “rippled”, allowing the heavy fluid to fall through the light fluid. In plasmas, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability can occur when a dense plasma is supported against gravity by the pressure of a magnetic field.\nThe situation would not be of much interest or relevance in its own right, since actual gravitational forces are rarely of much importance in plasmas. However, in curved magnetic fields, the centrifugal force on the plasma due to particle motion along the curved field-lines acts like a “gravitational” force (Section 7.1.3). For this reason, the analysis of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability provides useful insight as to the stability properties of plasmas in curved magnetic fields. Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities driven by actual field curvature are the most virulent type of MHD instability in non-uniform plasmas.\nHere we use a 2-fluid model and a so-called “diffuse boundary” model (Chen 2016) to describe it mathematically. Recall the structure of magnetic mirror: we have curved magnetic field lines and high density plasma at the center. From the discussion in Section 13.2.2, we know that the central part of magnetic mirror is unstable for Rayleigh-Taylor instability because of centrifugal force. Let us simplify the scenario and study the problem in Cartesian coordinates. The centrifugal force is irrelevant to particle charge and proportional to particle mass, so both ions and electrons have the same acceleration due to it. Let us replace the centrifugal force with gravity \\(\\mathbf{g}\\). In Figure 13.6, there are high density plasma on top and low density plasma on the bottom, with a distribution \\(\\partial n_o/\\partial x&lt;0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: Simultaion of Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Rahman and San 2019).\n\n\n\n\n13.4.1 2-Fluid Diffuse Boundary Model\nThis section is similar to Section 6.7 in (Chen 2016).\nThe continuity and momentum equations are: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial n_j}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(n_j \\mathbf{v_j})&=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v_j}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v_j}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v_j}&=\\frac{q_j}{m_j}\\big( \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v_j}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\big)-\\frac{\\nabla P_j}{n_j m_j} + \\mathbf{g}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(j=e^-, i^+\\) for electrons and ions.\nAssume an one-dimensional case \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_e = T_i = 0 \\Rightarrow P_e=n_ek_BT_e = 0,\\ P_i = n_ik_BT_i = 0 \\\\\nn_0 = n_0(x), \\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x}&lt;0\\ (\\textrm{nonuniform plasma}) \\\\\n\\mathbf{g}=g\\hat{x}, g=\\textrm{const.}&gt;0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_0=B_0\\hat{z},\\ B_0=\\textrm{const.},\\ \\mathbf{E}_0=0\\ (\\textrm{no gradient/curvature drift})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that there is no diamagnetic current if \\(P_e=P_i=0\\) (no electric field so no current along \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) ?): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\mathbf{J}_{de}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0=-\\nabla P_e=0 \\\\\n&\\mathbf{J}_{di}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0=-\\nabla P_i=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\mathbf{J}_{de}=\\mathbf{J}_{di}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInstability arises when an equilibrium state is violated. What is the force that balances the gravity? It turns out to be the Lorentz force \\(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) term: the separation of electrons and ions creates currents, and currents lead to force.\nADD FIGURE!\nIn equilibrium, \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big[ n_{0j}(x)v_{0j} \\big]=0,\\) \\(v_{0j}=\\text{const.}\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\frac{\\partial{n_{oj}}}{{\\partial t}}+\\nabla\\cdot(n_{oj}\\mathbf{v}_{oj})=0 \\\\\n&\\frac{q_j}{m_j}\\mathbf{v}_j\\times\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{g}=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{v}_i=\\frac{gm_i}{q_iB_0}(-\\hat{y})=-\\frac{g}{\\Omega_i}\\hat{y}=-\\hat{y}v_{0i} \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_e=\\frac{gm_e}{q_eB_0}(\\hat{y})=\\frac{g}{\\Omega_e}\\hat{y}=\\hat{y}v_{0e}\\approx 0 (v_{0e}\\ll v_{0i})\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\Omega_i,\\ \\Omega_e\\) are the gyro-frequency for ions and electrons respectively.\nNow, we introduce an electrostatic perturbation on this equilibrium state (\\(\\mathbf{B}_1(\\mathbf{x},t)=0\\), \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_1=-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}_1}{\\partial t}=i\\omega\\mathbf{B}_1=0\\), \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) can be written as a gradient of a scalar potential) \\[\n\\mathbf{E}_1(\\mathbf{x},t)=-\\nabla\\Phi_1 = -\\nabla\\big[ \\phi_1(x)e^{ik_y y-i\\omega t} \\big]\n\\]\nIn addition, we adopt the so-called “local approximation”, i.e. we assume \\(\\partial \\phi_1/\\partial x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[ E_1,\\mathbf{v}_1,n_1 \\big]=0\\). This is a very drastic assumption that greatly simplifies the problem but cannot be justified. This assumption is commonly used in many textbooks, both explicitly and implicitly (e.g. (Bellan 2008) used this to treat universal instability. Remember in solving the Vlasov equations, we integrate along the unperturbed orbits, which also requires this assumption.)\nIn this case, \\[\n\\mathbf{E}_1=0\\hat{x}+E_{1y}\\hat{y}=\\hat{y}\\widetilde{E}_{1y}e^{ik_y y-i\\omega t}\n\\] where \\(\\widetilde{E}_{1y}=-i k_y \\phi_1\\) is a constant.\nLinearization: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(n_0+n_1) +\\nabla\\cdot\\big[ (n_0+n_1)(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1) \\big]&=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1)+(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1)\\cdot\\nabla(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1)&=\\frac{q}{m}\\big[ \\mathbf{E}_0+\\mathbf{E}_1+(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1)\\times(\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_1)\\big]+\\mathbf{g}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nGetting rid of the equilibrium and high-order terms, we have (Notice that \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) does not even appear here! In MHD, it does, in a very explicit way.) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni(k_yv_{0y}-\\omega)n_1=-n_0 ik_y v_{1y} - v_{1x}\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{v}_1=i(k_yv_{0y}-\\omega)\\mathbf{v}_1=\\frac{q}{m}\\big( \\mathbf{E}_1+\\mathbf{v}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_0 \\big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, from the linearized momentum equation, we can get the x and y components of perturbed velocity; intuitively, you can guess the expression: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&v_{1,ix}=\\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0},\\ v_{1,ex}=\\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0}\\\\\n&v_{1,iy}=\\frac{1}{\\Omega_i}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big(\\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0} \\Big)=\\frac{i(k_yv_{0i}-\\omega)}{\\Omega_i}\\Big( \\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0}\\Big),\\ v_{1,ey}=\\frac{1}{\\Omega_e}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big(\\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0} \\Big)\\approx0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where in the x direction, it is the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift, and in the y direction, it is the polarization drift.\nFrom the linearized continuity equation \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ni(k_y v_{0,yi}-\\omega)n_{1i} &= -n_0 ik_y v_{1,yi} - v_{1,xi}\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x} \\\\\n-i\\omega n_{1e} &= - v_{1,xe}\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen we can get \\(n_{1e}=n_{1e}(E_{1y}),\\ n_{1i}=n_{1i}(E_{1y})\\). Setting \\(n_{1e}=n_{1i}\\), we have the dispersion relation \\[\n\\omega(\\omega-k_y v_{0i})=g\\frac{1}{n_0}\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x}\n\\]\nWhen \\(k_y\\rightarrow0\\), \\[\n\\omega^2=g\\frac{1}{n_0}\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x}&lt;0 \\Rightarrow\\ \\text{instability!}\n\\]\nLet’s think about this 2-fluid approach for a while. Apparently, we cannot treat a sharp boundary, namely \\(\\frac{\\partial n_0}{\\partial x}=\\delta(x)\\), with exactly the same equations. However, it’s quite a surprise that MHD approach can easily do that, as we will see in the next section.\n\n\n13.4.2 Single fluid MHD method\nIn equilibrium, \\(\\mathbf{g}=\\hat{x}g,\\ \\mathbf{B}_0=\\hat{z}B_0(x),\\ \\mathbf{U}_0=0,\\ \\mathbf{E}_0=0,\\ \\rho_0(x),\\ p_0(x)\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_0 \\mathbf{U}_0)=0 \\\\\n0=\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\Big[ -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}({B_0}^2)\\Big] -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}p_0(x)+\\rho_0(x)g\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that there’s a difference between cases where different pressure is dominant. For example, in z-pinch the magnetic pressure is dominant, while in a laser pulse, the thermal pressure is usually dominant.\nAssume perturbations of the form \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np_1(\\mathbf{x},t) &= p_1(x) e^{ik_y y-i\\omega t} \\\\\n\\rho_1(\\mathbf{x},t) &= \\rho_1(x) e^{i k_y y-i\\omega t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{U}_1 &=\\frac{\\partial \\pmb{\\xi}_1}{\\partial t}=-i\\omega\\pmb{\\xi}_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\pmb{\\xi}_1\\) is the displacement.\nWe can calculate each linear term: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\big[(\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_1)\\cdot\\nabla \\big](\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_1) \\approx (\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}_1 + (\\mathbf{B}_1\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}_0 = \\big( B_0(x)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\big)\\mathbf{B}_1 \\\\\nB^2 = (\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_1)\\cdot(\\mathbf{B}_1+\\mathbf{B}_1)\\approx 2\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{U}_0+\\mathbf{U}_1 = \\mathbf{U}_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe tension term has no x or y component, so we can just ignore it. Then the linearized momentum equation can be written as \\[\n\\rho_0\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_1}{\\partial t}=\\rho_0\\frac{\\partial^2\\pmb{\\xi}_1}{\\partial t^2}=-\\nabla\\Big( \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}\\Big) - \\nabla p_1 +\\rho_1\\mathbf{g}\n\\] which can be separated into two scalar equations \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\rho_0 \\omega^2 \\xi_{1x} &= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big( \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}+p_1 \\Big) +\\rho_1 g \\\\\n-\\rho_0 \\omega^2 \\xi_{1y} &= -ik_y\\Big( \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{\\mu_0}+p_1\\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAssume incompressibility \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0\\Rightarrow \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_1=0,\\ \\nabla\\cdot\\pmb{\\xi}_1=\\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x}+ik_y \\xi_{1y}=0\n\\]\nThe linearized continuity equation (Section 10.14) yields \\[\n\\rho_1=-\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_0\\pmb{\\xi}_1)=\\xi_{1x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\rho_0\n\\]\nCombining the last four equations, we have \\[\n-\\rho_0\\omega^2 \\xi_{1x} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big[ \\rho_0\\omega^2 \\frac{1}{{k_y}^2}\\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\Big] - g\\xi_{1x}\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial x}\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nThis is the governing equation for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which is the same as Eq.(10.15) in (Bellan 2008). Note that here we have no assumption on the x-dependence; if we simply use the local approximation as before, this immediately gives you the identical result.\nTo treat the sharp boundary problem, we assume \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_0= \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\textrm{const.} & \\text{if } x&lt;0 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } x&gt;0\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen for \\(x&lt;0\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x^2} -{k_y}^2 \\xi_{1x} = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ \\xi_{1x}=Ae^{k_y x} + Be^{-k_y x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand for \\(x&gt;0\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x^2} -{k_y}^2 \\xi_{1x} = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ \\xi_{1x}=Ce^{k_y x} + De^{-k_y x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe coefficient \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) must be zero because of infinite field requirement. Due to continuity at \\(x=0\\), we set \\[\nA = D = \\xi_0\n\\]\nThe density profile obeys \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial x}=-\\rho_0\\delta(x)\n\\]\nIntegrating the governing Equation 13.1 from \\(x=0^-\\) to \\(x=0^+\\) yields \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&-\\frac{\\rho_0 \\omega^2}{{k_y}^2}\\frac{\\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0^-}^{x=0^+} - g\\xi_{1x}(-\\rho_0)=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &\\omega^2=k_y g\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore the growth rate is \\(\\gamma=\\Im(\\omega)=\\sqrt{k_y g}\\). You may realize that \\(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0=0\\) here, so this magnetic stablizing term vanishes in the dispersion relation.\n\n\n13.4.3 2-fluid sharp boundary model\nNow let’s go back and see if we can treat the sharp boundary problem with 2-fluid model. This is actually not easy: it is first solved by S.Chandraserkhar in the view of particle orbit theory. I believe there is a more `modern’ way of doing exactly the same thing, but here I just list the original derivation.\nWe consider a plasma at uniform temperature lying above a horizontal plane in a uniform gravitational field directed vertically downwards. There is a horizontal magnetic field in x direction uniform in each half volumn with a jump in field strength produced by a uniform horizontal current sheet at the boundary plane \\(z=0\\). The gravitational force is balanced by a pressure gradient in the plasma and by the jump in the magnetic pressure at \\(z=0\\).\nWe now suppose the boundary of the plasam at \\(z=0\\) to be rippled by a sinusoidal disturbance as shown in fig-RT_perturb. We may write for the displacement of the interface (ADD FIGURE!) \\[\n\\Delta z = a \\sin ky\n\\tag{13.2}\\] where \\(a\\), the amplitude of the disturbance, is considered small and \\(k(=2\\pi/\\lambda)\\) is the wave number of the disturbance in the y-direction. The drift resulting from gravity is given by \\[\n\\mathbf{V}_g = \\frac{m}{q}\\frac{\\mathbf{g}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\]\nSince the magnetic field is in the x-direction, the electrons will drift to the right and the positive ions will drift to the left. The gravity drift, therefore, causes a charge separation in the plasma and the resulting boundary has the form shown in ?fig-RT-displacement. The surface charge \\(\\delta\\sigma\\) due to the separation (\\(\\delta\\Delta z\\)) of ions and electrons is given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta\\sigma&=Ne\\delta\\Delta z \\\\\n&=Ne\\frac{\\partial \\Delta z}{\\partial y}\\delta y \\\\\n&=e\\frac{\\partial \\Delta z}{\\partial y}V_g \\delta t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore, the time rate of change of the surface charge density is given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t}&=NeV_g\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Delta z \\\\\n&=-Ne\\frac{Mg}{eB}ak\\cos ky \\\\\n&=-\\frac{NMeg}{B}ak\\cos ky\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{13.3}\\] where in writing these expressions, we have neglected the electron drift, as being small in the ratio \\(m/M\\) compared to the ion drift. The electric field resulting from the surface charge can be computed in a straight-forward manner. In the region away from the boundary, we must have \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon\\mathbf{E})=0\n\\tag{13.4}\\] where \\(\\epsilon=\\epsilon_0\\big( 1+\\frac{{\\omega_{pi}}^2}{{\\Omega_i}^2}\\big)=...\\) is the dielectric constant of the plasma. At the interface the electric field is determined by \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon\\mathbf{E})=\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\frac{\\sigma}{dz}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the surface charge density and \\(\\mathrm{d}z\\) is the infinitesimal thickness of the layer. We now integrate this equation over an element of volumn \\(\\mathrm{d}S\\mathrm{d}z\\). The right-hand side gives the charge within the column element (\\(\\sigma\\mathrm{d}S\\)). Making use of Gauss`s theorem to transform the left-hand side, we obtain \\[\n\\epsilon E_z dS = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\sigma dS = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\sigma_0 \\cos ky dS\n\\]\nThus the electric field at the interface is given by \\[\n\\epsilon E_z = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\mu_0}\\cos ky\n\\tag{13.5}\\]\nThe electric field which satisfies Equation 13.4 within the plasma and the boundary condition Equation 13.5 at \\(z=0\\) has the components \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE_y &= \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\mu_0\\epsilon}\\sin ky\\, e^{-kz} \\\\\nE_z &= \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\mu_0\\epsilon}\\cos ky\\, e^{-kz}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with \\(E_x=0\\). These electric fields give rise to the drifts which can be computed from the equation \\[\n\\mathbf{V}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n\\]\nRemembering that \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is in the x-direction, we obtain \\[\nV_y = \\frac{E_z}{B},\\quad V_z = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\nFrom the foregoing equations we obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_y &= \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\mu_0 B}\\cos ky\\, e^{-kz} \\\\\nV_z &=-\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\mu_0 B}\\sin ky\\, e^{-kz}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is clear from the solutions that the velocity field is divergence free and, therefore, does not cause any change in the density of the plasma except at the boundary. We have \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Delta z(z=0)=V_z(z=0) = -\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu_0 B}\\sin ky\n\\tag{13.6}\\]\nFrom Equation 13.2 and Equation 13.6, we obtain the equation of motion for the amplitude \\(a\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{\\mathrm{d}t}=-\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\mu_0 B}\n\\]\nEquation 13.3 and Equation 13.5 yield \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_0}{\\mathrm{d}t}=-\\frac{NMg}{\\mu_0B}ak\n\\]\nFrom the above two equations, we obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 a}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0\\epsilon B}\\frac{NMg}{B}ka \\\\\n&\\approx gka, \\quad(\\text{for } \\epsilon \\gg 1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] (\\(g=...\\) from equilibrium). The solution of this equation is given by \\[\na(t) = a_0e^{\\pm\\sqrt{gk} t}\n\\]\nIt is interesting to note that the rate of growth of the instability is exactly the same as in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a fluid supported against gravity by a second fluid which is weightless. The charge separation is able to overcome exactly the restraining influence of the magnetic field. This exact compensation occurs only in the limit of \\(\\epsilon\\gg1\\).\nThe same result can also be obtained using the rigorous formulation of the Boltzmann transport equation. However, in more complicated cases, the first order orbit theory gives results which agree with those obtained from the Boltzmann equation only in some special cases.\nThe essential mechanism which gives rise to the instability is the charge separation resulting from the gravity drift — drift arising from a force which does not depend upon the sign of the charge. If we consider a plasma configuration in a torus, the particles experience the centrifugal force \\(m{v_\\parallel}^2/R\\) and the gradient B force \\(m{v_\\perp}^2/R\\) which are both independent of the sign of the charge. Therefore, we should expect instabilities in a plasma confined to a torus.",

From the MHD momentum equation, take \\(\\partial/\\partial t=0,\\ \\mathbf{J}=0,\\ \\mathbf{g}=0\\), we obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}=-\\nabla p\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUsing the natural coordinates, let \\(\\hat{t}\\) be the unit tangent vector on a streamline, \\(\\hat{n}\\) be the unit normal vector pointing from concave to convex side, and \\(ds\\) be the infinitisimal distance along streamline, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v} &= (\\rho v\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial s})\\mathbf{v} =\\rho v_s \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial s}(\\hat{t} v) =\\rho v \\Big( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial s}\\hat{t} + \\frac{\\partial \\hat{t}}{\\partial s}v\\Big) \\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial s}\\hat{t}-\\nabla_\\perp p\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\hat{t}:\\ pv\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial s}+\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial s}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\Big( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + p \\Big) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + p = \\text{const.}\\) along a streamline for an incompressible flow. This is the classical Bernoulli equation.\nNow, consider two flow layer with velocity shear at the plane interface in fig-two-layer (ADD FIGURE!). Imaging there’s a ripple on the layer interface pointing upward at \\(Q\\). If we examine the cross section at \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) for the lower layer respectively, we find \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{flux at P} = \\rho v A|_P = \\text{flux at Q} = \\rho v A|_Q\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince density along field lines are constant (incompressible) and area \\(A_P&lt;A_Q\\), we have \\(v_P&gt;v_Q\\). From the Bernoulli equation, \\(p_P&lt;p_Q\\). Similar for the upper layer, we get the pressure at \\(P\\) is larger than that at \\(Q\\). Therefore, the total pressure is pointing away from interface, which let the ripple grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Two layers of flow with a velocity shear at the plane interface.\n\n\n\nNow we are ready to do more careful derivations. The governing equations are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}&=0 \\\\\n\\rho\\Big( \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}\\Big) &= -\\nabla p \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn equilibrium, suppose there is a velocity shear in the x direction, and the interface lies along the y direction, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_0 &= \\text{const.} \\\\\np_0 &= \\text{const.} \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_0 &= \\hat{y}v_{0y}(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAssume linear perturbations of the form \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{1x}(\\mathbf{x},t) &= v_{1x}(x)e^{i k_y y-i\\omega t} \\\\\np_1(\\mathbf{x},t) &= p_1(x)e^{i k_y y-i\\omega t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] so the linearized momentum equation is \\[\n\\rho_0\\big( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_1}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}_0\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}_1 +\\mathbf{v}_1\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}_0 \\big) = -\\nabla p_1\n\\] where \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{v}_0\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}_1 &= i k_y v_{0y} \\mathbf{v}_1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_1\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{v}_0 &= v_{1x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}v_{0y}(x)\\hat{y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen the x and y components of the linearized momentum equation give \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i\\omega \\rho_0 v_{1x} +\\rho_0 i k_y v_{0y}v_{1x} &= -\\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial x} \\\\\n-i\\omega \\rho_0 v_{1y} + \\rho_0 i k_y v_{0y}v_{1y} + \\rho_0 v_{1x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}v_{0y}(x) &= -ik_y p_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTogether with the linearized incompressibility condition \\[\n\\frac{\\partial v_{1x}}{\\partial x} + ik_y v_{1y}  = 0\n\\] by eliminating \\(p_1\\) and \\(v_{1y}\\) we get \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 v_{1x}}{\\partial x^2} - \\Big[ {k_y}^2 - \\frac{k_y {v_{0y}}^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{\\omega-k_y v_{0y}(x)} \\Big]v_{1x} = 0\n\\tag{13.7}\\]\nNow we are half way from obtaining the dispersion relation. For simplicity, let us assume three layer regions with Region I on the left (\\(x&lt;0\\)), Region II in the middle (\\(x\\in(0,\\tau)\\)), and Region III on the right (\\(x&gt;\\tau\\)). Let the shear layer II thickness be \\(\\tau\\). Set the velocity on the two sides \\(v_1 = 0,\\ v_2 = v_1+\\Delta v \\equiv v\\), and \\(k_y=k\\). Then \\[\nv_{0y}^{\\prime\\prime}(x) = \\Big(\\frac{v}{\\tau}\\Big)\\big[ \\delta(x) - \\delta(x-\\tau)\\big]\n\\] except at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\tau\\). Equation 13.7 can be simplified to \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 v_{1x}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2 v_{1x} = 0\n\\]\nIn region I (\\(x&lt;0\\)), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{1x} &= \\xi_0 e^{kx},\\quad x&lt;0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=0_-} &= k\\xi_0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn region III (\\(x&gt;\\tau\\)), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{1x} &= \\xi_\\tau e^{-k(x-\\tau)},\\quad x&gt;\\tau \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=\\tau^+} &= -k\\xi_\\tau\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn region II (\\(x\\in(0,\\tau)\\)), we are looking for a solution which is a superposition of the solutions from both sides and is continuous at the boundaries \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{1x} &=\\xi_\\tau \\frac{\\sinh{kx}}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} + \\xi_0\\frac{\\sinh{k(x-\\tau)}}{\\sinh{-k\\tau}},\\quad 0&lt;x&lt;\\tau \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=\\tau^-} &= k\\xi_\\tau \\frac{\\cosh{k\\tau}}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} - k\\xi_0\\frac{1}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v_{1x}}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=0^+} &= k\\xi_\\tau \\frac{1}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} - k\\xi_0\\frac{\\cosh{k\\tau}}{\\sinh{k\\tau}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe continuity at \\(x = 0\\) requires \\(V_{0y}=0, V_{1x}=\\xi_0\\). Integrating the governing Equation 13.7 from \\(x=0^-\\) to \\(x=0^+\\) yields \\[\n-\\xi_0 k\\frac{\\cosh{k\\tau}}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} + \\xi_\\tau k\\frac{1}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} - k\\xi_0 + \\frac{kv}{\\omega\\tau}\\xi_0 = 0\n\\]\nIntegrating the governing Equation 13.7 from \\(x=\\tau^-\\) to \\(x=\\tau^+\\) yields \\[\n-\\xi_\\tau k +\\xi_0 k\\frac{1}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} - \\xi_\\tau k\\frac{\\cosh{k\\tau}}{\\sinh{k\\tau}} - \\frac{kv}{\\omega\\tau}\\xi_\\tau = 0\n\\]\nCombining the last two equations, we obtain \\[\n1 = \\Big[ \\sinh{k\\tau} + \\cosh{k\\tau} + \\frac{kv}{\\omega-kv}\\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big] \\Big[ \\cosh{k\\tau}+\\sinh{k\\tau} - \\frac{kv}{\\omega}\\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big]\n\\] which is the dispersion relation for the KH instability.\nWith the identity \\(\\sinh{k\\tau} + \\cosh{k\\tau} = e^{k\\tau}\\), the dispersion relation can be simplified to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1 &= \\Big[ e^{k\\tau} + \\frac{kv}{\\omega-kv}\\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big] \\Big[ e^{k\\tau} - \\frac{kv}{\\omega}\\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big] \\\\\n1 &= e^{2k\\tau} +e^{k\\tau}\\frac{(k\\tau)^2}{\\omega(\\omega-kv)}\\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau} - \\frac{(k\\tau)^2}{\\omega(\\omega-k\\tau)}\\Big(\\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big)^2 \\\\\n1 &= e^{2k\\tau} + \\frac{(k\\tau)^2}{\\omega(\\omega-kv)} \\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau} \\Big[ e^{k\\tau} - \\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(\\omega(\\omega-kv)\\), we get \\[\n\\omega(\\omega-k\\tau)(1-e^{2k\\tau}) = (kv)^2  \\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau} \\Big[ e^{k\\tau} - \\frac{\\sinh{k\\tau}}{k\\tau}\\Big]\n\\]\nAssuming \\(k\\tau\\ll 1\\) (long wavelength approximation), \\(e^{k\\tau}\\approx 1+k\\tau\\), we obtain \\[\n\\omega(\\omega-kv) + \\frac{(kv)^2}{2} \\approx 0\n\\] the solution of which is \\[\n\\omega=\\frac{1}{2}kv(1\\pm i),\\quad k\\tau \\ll 1\n\\]\nIn general, the growth rate of KH is \\[\n\\omega_i = \\frac{1}{2}|k_y \\Delta v|,\\quad k_y\\tau\\ll 1\n\\]\n\n13.5.1 Diocotron instability on electron sheet\nHAVEN’T CHECKED!\nA diocotron instability is a plasma instability created by two sheets of charge slipping past each other. Energy is dissipated in the form of two surface waves propagating in opposite directions, with one flowing over the other. This instability is the plasma analog of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in fluid mechanics.\nFor the simplest case, we have a uniform electron sheet and a parallel constant magnetic field in the plane of the sheet, as illustrated in fig-electron-sheet. Due to space charge of electron sheet, there is electric field pointing towards the sheet in the upper and lower region. Consider a small perturbation (sinusoidal ripple) on an electron sheet. The coulomb force expels electrons outward, so the electrons will drift, according to the right-hand rule, to the left. The deficit of electrons is equivalent to some positive charge distribution, and thus created an electric field. The \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift is pointing outward, so the perturbation is growing. Note that even though this problem looks innocent, but it is actually not easy. People, even the giants in plasma physics, made a lot of mistakes in the derivation!\nIf there is also a magnetic field inside the sheet, the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift will form a velocity gradient within the sheet, and lead to K-H instability. Denote \\(\\sigma_0\\) as the surface charge density and \\(\\rho_0\\) as charge density, we have \\[\n\\sigma_0 = \\rho_0 \\tau = en_0\\tau,\n\\] and the velocity shear across the sheet \\[\n\\Delta v = \\frac{E_2}{B_0} + \\frac{E_1}{B_0} = -\\frac{1}{B_0}\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\epsilon_0}=-\\frac{en_0\\tau}{B_0 \\epsilon_0}.\n\\] Then from the dispersion relation of K-H mode, we have the growth rate \\[\n\\omega_i = \\frac{1}{2}k_y|\\Delta v|=\\frac{1}{2}k_y\\Big|\\frac{en_0\\tau}{B_0 \\epsilon_0}\\Big|=\\frac{1}{2}k_y \\tau\\frac{{\\omega_{pe}}^2}{|\\Omega_e|},\n\\] which is valid as long as \\(k_y\\tau\\ll1\\),i.e., long wave length limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Illustration of an electron sheet with surface charge density \\(\\sigma_0\\), charge density \\(\\rho_0\\) and thickness \\(\\tau\\). The electric field is generated by electron charge in the sheet, and the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift will cause a velocity shear through the sheet. This velocity shear will lead to K-H instability.\n\n\n\n(Bellan 2008) P537.\nFIGURE NEEDED from H.W.3.4 Consider the diocotron instabity on a MELBA-like annular electron beam which propagates inside a metallic drift tube. Let $V = $ beam voltage, \\(I =\\) beam current, \\(a =\\) beam radius, \\(\\tau=\\) annular beam thickness (\\(\\tau\\ll 1\\))m \\(L=\\) length of drift tube, $T = $ beam’s pulselength, \\(B=\\) axial magnetic field. Note that the combined self-electric and self-magnetic field of the beam produces a slow rotational \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift in the \\(\\theta-\\)direction. This azimuthal drift velocity, \\(v_{0\\theta}\\), is much less than the axial velocity of the beam, but it is sheared.\nIn equilibrium, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0&=q(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{E}) \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}&=v_{0\\theta}\\hat{\\theta} + v_{0z}\\hat{z} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}&=B_{0\\theta}\\hat{\\theta} + B_{0z}\\hat{z} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & v_\\theta - v_z B_\\theta + E_r = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom Ampère’s law, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_{0\\theta}\\cdot 2\\pi (a+\\tau) \\approx B_\\theta \\cdot 2\\pi a = \\mu_0 2\\pi a \\tau J_z \\\\\n\\Rightarrow J_z = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0\\tau} B_{0\\theta} = -en_0 V_{0z}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom Gauss’s law, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{-en_0}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\nE_r\\cdot 2\\pi a \\Delta = \\frac{-en_0}{\\epsilon_0}\\cdot 2\\pi a\\tau \\Delta \\\\\n\\Rightarrow E_r = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\tau(-e)n_0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSubstituing \\(E_r\\) and \\(J_z\\) into the radial force balance equation, we obtain \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{\\theta}\\big|_{r=a+\\tau} &= \\frac{1}{B_{z}}[V_{0z}B_\\theta - E_r]\\big|_{r=a+\\tau}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}\\frac{E_r}{B_z}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\gamma=(1-\\beta)^{-1/2}=1+V/(511\\text{ keV})\\), and \\(\\beta= V_{0z}/c\\).\nLet \\(\\nu=\\frac{I}{\\beta I_A}\\) be the Budker parameter, \\(I_A=4\\pi\\epsilon_0 mc^2/e=17\\,\\text{kA}\\) be the Alfvén-Lawson current, and \\(\\Omega=\\frac{eB_{0z}}{m_e}\\) be the nonrelativistic cyclotron frequency associated with the axial B field, we have \\[\nV_\\theta\\big|_{r=a+\\tau} = \\frac{2c^2\\nu}{\\Omega a\\gamma^2}\n\\]\nAt \\(r=a\\), \\(V_\\theta=0\\) because there’s no E field. Therefore the velocity shear in \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is \\[\n\\Delta V_{\\theta} = V_\\theta\\big|_{r=a+\\tau} - V_\\theta\\big|_{r=a} =\\frac{2c^2\\nu}{\\Omega a \\gamma^2}\n\\]\nThen from the analysis of K-H instability, the temporal growth rate \\(\\omega_i\\) is given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_i &= \\frac{1}{2}|k_\\theta \\Delta V_{0\\theta}| \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m}{a}\\frac{2c^2\\nu}{\\Omega a \\gamma^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor long wavelength limit, let \\(m=1\\).\nFor MELBA-like beam with the following parameters, \\(V=700\\text{keV},\\ I=1\\text{kA},\\ a = 5\\text{cm},\\ \\tau=0.5\\text{cm},\\ T=500\\text{ns},\\ L=1\\text{m},\\ B=2\\text{kG}\\), \\[\n\\omega_i =1.18\\times 10^7 \\text{s}^{-1}\n\\]\nThe total number of e-folds of the instability growth during the pulse time T is \\[\n\\omega_i T \\approx 5.9\n\\]\nEven though this is large, K-H instability will not stay at the initial position and grow in time; instead it will be transported. It is more meaningful to estimate the spatial growth by evaluating the total number of e-folds experienced by a signal of some frequency as it propagates along the machine length L: \\[\nk_i L =\\frac{\\omega_i}{V_{0z}}L = \\omega_i \\frac{L}{\\beta c}\\approx 0.04\n\\]\nTherefore we don’t need to worry too much about this instability.",

The current density is then\n\\[\nJ_y(z) = \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 \\lambda}\\text{sech}^2\\Big(\\frac{z}{\\lambda}\\Big)\n\\]\nHarris current sheet can be taken as the first approximation of the Earth’s magnetotail that can stay stable for long time periods.\n\n\n13.6.2 θ-Pinch and Z-Pinch\nθ-pinch and Z-Pinch are both 1D equilibrium configurations expressed in cylindrical coordinates. In a θ-pinch cylindrical coils drive an elecric current and the magnetic field is axial, while in a Z-pinch the electric current is axial and the magnetic field is toroidal.\n\n\n13.6.3 Force-Free Field\nIf \\(\\beta\\ll 1\\) in MHD equilibrium, the pressure gradient is negligible and thus\n\\[\n\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} = 0\n\\tag{13.10}\\]\nSuch configurations are called force-free fields because the magnetic force on the plasma is zero. According to Equation 13.8 in a force-free field the magnetic pressure gradient \\(\\nabla(B^2/2\\mu_0)\\) is balanced by the magnetic tension force \\(\\mu_0^{-1}(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}\\). In reality the force-free equilibrium is often a very good approximation of the momentum equation. It is also evident from Equation 13.10 that in a force-free field the electric current flows along the magnetic field. Such currents are commonly called field-aligned currents (FAC).\nUsing Ampère’s law we can write Equation 13.10 as\n\\[\n(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B} = 0\n\\]\nFrom this we see that the innocent-looking equation \\(\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}=0\\) is in fact nonlinear and thus difficult to solve.\nThe field-alignment of the electric crrent can be expressed as\n\\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{J} = \\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is a function of position. Taking divergence of this we get\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\alpha = 0\n\\]\ni.e. \\(\\alpha\\) is constant along the magnetic field.\nIn the case \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant in all directions, the equation\n\\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\alpha\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{13.11}\\]\nis linear. Taking a curl Equation 13.11 we get the Helmholtz equation:\n\\[\n\\nabla^2\\mathbf{B} + \\alpha^2\\mathbf{B} = 0\n\\]\nSolution to the Helmoltz with helical equation in cylindrical symmetry was presented by Lundquist in 1950 in terms of Bessel functions \\(J_0\\) and \\(J_1\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_R &= 0 \\\\\nB_A &= B_0 J_0\\Big( \\frac{\\alpha_0 r}{r_0} \\Big) \\\\\nB_T &= \\pm B_0 J_1\\Big( \\frac{\\alpha_0 r}{r_0} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(B_r, B_A\\), and \\(B_T\\) are radial, axial and tangential magnetic field components, respectively. The solution is a magnetic flux rope where magnetic field lines form helixes whose pitch angle increases from the axis (Figure 13.9). \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the flux rope axis, \\(r_0\\) is the radius of the flux rope and \\(B_0\\) is the maximum magnetic field magnitude at the center of the flux rope \\(r=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: Helical structure of a force-free magnetic field.\n\n\n\nA special case of a force-free magnetic field is the current-free configuration \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=0\\). Now the magnetic field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential \\(\\mathbf{B}=\\nabla\\Psi\\), and since \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0\\) it can be found via the Laplace equation\n\\[\n\\nabla^2\\Psi = 0\n\\]\nwith appropriate boundary conditions and using the methods of potential theory.\nFor example, the Sun’s magnetic field structure is often modeled by the so-called Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model (Figure 13.10). The magnetic field is computed from the Laplace equation using spherical coordinates from the photosphere to the “source surface”, nominally chosen to be at 2.5 Solar radii. At the source surface the Sun’s magnetic field is assumed to be purely radial. The inner boundary conditions are obtained from solar magnetograms. Thus, PFSS assumes that there is no electric current in the corona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: Helical structure of a force-free magnetic field.",

We will discuss them separately and in a set of combination below.\n\n13.7.1 Kink Mode\nA kink instability, is a current-driven plasma instability characterized by transverse displacements of a plasma column’s cross-section from its center of mass without any change in the characteristics of the plasma. It typically develops in a thin plasma column carrying a strong axial current which exceeds the Kruskal–Shafranov limit and is sometimes known as the Kruskal–Shafranov (kink) instability.\nThe kink instability was first widely explored in fusion power machines with Z-pinch configurations in the 1950s. It is one of the common magnetohydrodynamic instability modes which can develop in a pinch plasma and is sometimes referred to as the \\(m=1\\) mode.\nIf a “kink” begins to develop in a column the magnetic forces on the inside of the kink become larger than those on the outside, which leads to growth of the perturbation. As it develops at fixed areas in the plasma, kinks belong to the class of “absolute plasma instabilities”, as opposed to convective processes.\nKeyNotes.plot_kink()\nThe kink instability is the most dangerous instability in Tokamak. We have discussed this kind of microinstability from the view of single particle motion in Section 13.2; here, we will explore this a little bit further.\nString model\nFirst, image a current-carrying plasma column, shown in the x-z plane in fig-kink-column. The metallic wire carries current under tension \\(T\\), and \\(\\mu=\\)mass/length is the mass per length. From the basic mechanics, \\(C_s=\\sqrt{T/\\mu}\\) is the acoustic velocity in the system. Let the background field \\(\\mathbf{B}_0=\\hat{z}B_0\\) and the displacement \\(\\pmb{\\xi}=\\pmb{\\xi}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). We can show that, if the current \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is sufficiently strong, there will be kink instability.\nADD PLASMA KINK COLUMN FIGURE!\nAssume the displacement in x-y plane has the form\n\\[\n\\pmb{\\xi} = (\\xi_x,\\xi_y)e^{ik_z z-i\\omega t}\n\\]\nThe force law gives (i.e. the basic string model in mechanics textbooks)\n\\[\n\\mu\\frac{\\partial^2\\pmb{\\xi}}{\\partial t^2}=T\\frac{\\partial^2\\pmb{\\xi}}{\\partial z^2}+ \\text{force per unit length}\n\\]\nHere, the external force per length is the Lorentz force (which is why we say the R-T instability is current-driven),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{I}\\times\\mathbf{B}&=\\Big( \\hat{x}I\\frac{\\partial \\xi_x}{\\partial z}+\\hat{y}I\\frac{\\partial\\xi_y}{\\partial z}+\\hat{z}0 \\Big)\\times B_0\\hat{z} \\\\\n&=IB_0 \\Big( \\hat{x}\\frac{\\partial\\xi_y}{\\partial z}-\\hat{y}\\frac{\\partial \\xi_x}{\\partial z}\\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn scalar forms, the force law gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{x}:\\ -\\mu\\omega^2 \\xi_x &= T(-{k_z}^2)\\xi_x + IB_0 \\frac{\\partial \\xi_y}{\\partial z}\\\\\n\\hat{y}:\\ -\\mu\\omega^2\\xi_y &= T(-{k_z}^2)\\xi_y - IB_0 \\frac{\\partial \\xi_x}{\\partial z}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCombining these two equations, we can easily get the dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega^2 = {k_z}^2{C_s}^2 \\pm \\frac{IB_0}{\\mu_0 \\mu}k_z\n\\]\nThe dispersion relation is a representation of the force-law. The first term on the right-hand side is a stabilizing term due to tension; the second term with a minus sign is a destabilizing term due to Lorentz force. Note that the expression is very similar to R-T instability. (Which one?)\nWe can immediately estimate the scenario in a Tokamak. Take the radius of the column cut as \\(a\\), wave number \\(k_z\\sim 1/R\\) (i.e. wave length is on the order of tokamak radius), \\({C_s}^2={V_A}^2={B_{0z}}^2/(\\mu_0\\rho_0)\\) (i.e. tension in plasma give rises to Alfvén wave), then the current is\n\\[\nI=J_z(\\pi a^2)=\\frac{B_\\theta 2\\pi a}{\\mu_0} \\sim \\frac{B_\\theta a}{\\mu_0}\n\\]\nand the mass per unit length is\n\\[\n\\mu =\\rho_0(\\pi a^2) \\sim \\rho_0 a^2\n\\]\nThe criterion for stability then becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{k_z}^2{C_s}^2 &gt;\\frac{IB_0}{\\mu_0}k_z\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{{B_0z}^2}{\\mu_0\\rho_0}&gt;\\frac{B_\\theta a}{\\mu_0}\\frac{B_{0z}}{\\rho_0 a^2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &\\frac{a}{R}\\frac{B_{0z}}{B_{0\\theta}}&gt;1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich is called the Kruskal-Shafranov stability criterion. Usually we define\n\\[\nq\\equiv\\frac{a}{R}\\frac{B_{0z}}{B_{0\\theta}}=\\frac{a}{R}\\frac{B_t}{B_p}\n\\]\nas the safety factor. A real value for \\(q\\) is about 2 to 3.\nIdeal MHD Approach\nNow we use a more standard way to treat the kink mode. (Section 10.9 (Bellan 2008)) Assume we have a plasma column with radius \\(a\\). Inside the column, we assume infinite conductivity, \\(\\sigma=\\infty\\); outside the column, we assume vacuum so that we can only have current flow on surface \\(r=a\\). Thus, besides the universal background magnetic field in the z direction, we also have an azimuthal field due to surface current. (You will see later that the decay in \\(\\theta\\) actually drives the kink instability.)\nIn equilibrium,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr&lt;a:\\ &\\mathbf{B}_0 = \\hat{z}B_0 = \\text{const.} \\\\\n& p_0 = \\text{const.},\\ \\mathbf{v}_0 = \\text{const.},\\ \\mathbf{J}_0 = 0,\\ \\rho_0=\\text{const.} \\\\\nr&gt;a:\\ & \\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\\hat{z} + B_{0\\theta}\\frac{a}{r}\\hat{\\theta} \\\\\n& p_0=0,\\ \\rho_0 = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe force equation in equilibrium\n\\[\n\\nabla p_0 = \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0\n\\]\nis satisfied automatically both for \\(r&gt;a\\) and \\(r&lt;a\\).\nLet us introduce a small perturbation\n\\[\n\\pmb{\\xi}_{1r}(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\widetilde{\\xi}_{1r}(r)e^{ikz + im\\theta-i\\omega t}\n\\]\nsuch that at \\(r=a\\),\n\\[\n\\pmb{\\xi}_{1r}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\big|_{r=a} = \\widetilde{\\xi}_{1a}(r)e^{ikz + im\\theta-i\\omega t}\n\\]\nBefore running into linearized equations, we can first take a look at different wave modes. That is, what will the perturbation looks like at a fixed time \\(t\\) with different \\(m\\)? For simplicity, let us assume \\(t=0\\). (You can always make a time shift.) The actual displacement is the real part of \\(\\pmb{\\xi}\\),\n\\[\n\\xi_{1r} = \\xi_{1a}\\cos(k_z z+m\\theta)\n\\]\nFor \\(m=0\\),\n\\[\n\\xi_{1r} = \\xi_{1a}\\cos(k_z z)\n\\]\nwhich is the sausage mode.\nFor \\(m=1\\),\n\\[\n\\xi_{1r} = \\xi_{1a}\\cos(k_z z+\\theta)\n\\]\nIf we draw the displacement down for \\(k_z z=0,\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi,\\frac{3}{2}\\pi\\), you can see one rotation in a \\(2\\pi\\) period, which indicates a shape of helix. This is often called the kink mode.\nFor higher \\(m\\),\n\\[\n\\xi_{1r} = \\xi_{1a}\\cos(k_z z+m\\theta)\n\\]\nwhich looks like \\(m\\) intertwine helixes in one axial wavelength.\nNow let’s return to the perturbed equations.

In the liner inertial fusion experiment, there is a mixture of R-T, sausage, kink and many high order modes.\nIn general, the dispersion relation can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\omega^2 = (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v_A})^2 - \\text{destablizing term}\n\\]\nwhere the destablizing term can be gravity \\(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{g}\\), current \\(I/I_{crit}\\), tearing mode due to resistivity, etc.\n\nIf we do the same analysis in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z), there will be no sausage or kink mode! See HW3.\n\n3-Region Problem\nIn 572 HW3.1, we have shown that a Cartesian liner is always stable for kink and sausage mode while a cylindrical liner isn’t. However, if you also consider the gravity (or equivalently, centrifugal forc, etc.) then you can have magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability.\nHere we show the derivation of dispersion relation in a 3-region problem in Cartesian liner. This method can be found in Chandrasekhar`s book on instability, P429. Consider Fig.1 shown in Prof.Lau’s paper “Anisotropy and feedthrough in magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability”. The interface of the regions are \\(x=\\alpha,\\ x=\\beta\\). The governing equation including gravity is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\Big\\{ \\rho_0\\big[ \\omega^2-(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big] \\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x} \\Big\\}\n- k^2 \\big[ \\rho_0\\big( \\omega^2 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big)+g\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial x}\\big] \\xi_{1x} = 0\n\\]\nIf \\(\\rho_0=\\text{const.}\\Rightarrow g\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial x}=0\\). Within region I, II, and III, the governing equation can be simplified to\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\xi_{1x}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - k^2\\xi_{1x} = 0\n\\]\nthe general solution of which reads\n\\[\n\\xi_{1x} = Ae^{-kx} + Be^{kx} = C\\sinh{k(x-\\alpha)} + D\\sinh{k(x-\\beta)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A,B,C,D\\) are coefficients. Cancelling out the unphysical solutions in each region, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{I: }& \\xi_{1x} = \\xi_\\beta e^{k(x-\\beta)} \\\\\n\\text{II: }& \\xi_{1x} = \\xi_\\alpha \\frac{\\sinh{k(x-\\beta)}}{\\sinh{k(\\alpha-\\beta)}} + \\xi_\\beta \\frac{\\sinh{k(x-\\alpha)}}{\\sinh{k(\\beta-\\alpha)}} \\\\\n\\text{III: }& \\xi_{1x} = \\xi_\\alpha e^{-k(x-\\alpha)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that there’s a jump for \\(\\rho_0(x)\\) at \\(x=\\alpha,\\beta\\). Now we can integrate the governing equation across the boundaries,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{x=\\alpha^-}^{x=\\alpha^+} \\mathrm{d}x \\Big[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\Big\\{ \\rho_0\\big[ \\omega^2-(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big] \\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x} \\Big\\}\n- k^2 \\big[ \\rho_0\\big( \\omega^2 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big)+g\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial x}\\big] \\xi_{1x}  \\Big]= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow F_1(\\xi_\\alpha,\\xi_\\beta) = 0 \\\\\n\\int_{x=\\beta^-}^{x=\\beta^+} \\mathrm{d}x \\Big[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\Big\\{ \\rho_0\\big[ \\omega^2-(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big] \\frac{\\partial \\xi_{1x}}{\\partial x} \\Big\\}\n- k^2 \\big[ \\rho_0\\big( \\omega^2 - (\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_A)^2\\big)+g\\frac{\\partial \\rho_0}{\\partial x}\\big] \\xi_{1x}  \\Big]= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow F_2(\\xi_\\alpha,\\xi_\\beta) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFinally, from \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\), we can get the dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega^4 - R\\omega^2  + S = 0\n\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are functions of \\(B_{01},B_{02},B_{03},\\rho_{01},\\rho_{02},\\rho_{03},g,\\Delta,k_y\\) and \\(k_z\\).\nNext, we can examine the temporal evolution of sinusoidal ripples at interfaces in the form\n\\[\n\\xi_{\\alpha,\\beta}(t) = A_1 e^{i\\omega_1 t}+A_2 e^{-i\\omega_3 t}+A_3e^{i\\omega_3 t}  + A_4 e^{-i\\omega_3 t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_3\\) are two eigen mode from the dispersion relation. See the details in the paper. The details of dispersion relation is given in M.Weis, et. al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 122708 (2014), and the coulping of MRT, sausage and kink mode in a cyclindrical liner is given by M.Weis, et. al., Phys. Plasma 22, 032706 (2015).\nNote: for RT/MRT,\n\\[\n\\xi_{RT}(t) \\sim\\xi_0 e^{\\gamma t} &lt; \\xi_0 e^{\\sqrt{gk}t}\n\\]\nthe growth rate\n\\[\n\\gamma_{\\max} = \\sqrt{gk}\n\\]\nIf we use \\(s=\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{2s}=\\sqrt{|g|}t\\),\n\\[\n\\xi_{RT}(t)&lt;\\xi_0 e^{\\sqrt{2ks}}\n\\]\nwhich only depends on wavenumber and distance.\n\n\n13.7.2 Sausage Mode\nThe \\(m=0\\) mode is known as the sausage instability. There is no \\(B_z\\) so we have purely toroidal field. The initial equilibrium is established with radially inward Lorentz force and outward pressure gradient. But it is unstable to interchange due to curvature. When a perturbation that causes the rings to shrink, magnetic field in the plasma increases so that the \\(\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) Lorentz force increases. There is nothing to counter this radially inward force increase, which leads to instability.\nThe dispersion relation is\n\\[\n\\omega^2 = -2\\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0}\\frac{k}{R_c^2}\n\\]\nAdding \\(B_z\\) to the interior plasma stabilizes sausage instability: the magnetic pressure caused by \\(B_z\\) pushes back to oppose squeezing. The pressure balance at the interface gives\n\\[\np_0 + \\frac{B_{0z}^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\frac{B_\\phi^2}{2\\mu_0}\n\\]\nWith the modified dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega^2 = -2\\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 a^2} + \\frac{B_{0z}^2}{\\mu_0\\rho_0 a^2}\n\\]\nwe have the condition for stability\n\\[\nB_{0z}^2 &gt; \\frac{1}{2}B_\\phi^2\n\\]\nTHIS IS PROBABLY DUPLICATE WITH THE PREVIOUS SECTION.\n\n\n13.7.3 Kink Mode\nHowever, even when the sausage mode is suppressed, the configuration is still unstable to the kink mode. This \\(m=1\\) mode retains circular cross-section of the tube and the perturbation is a kink of the tube into a helix. Without \\(B_z\\), the system is unstable for all \\(k\\); with \\(B_z\\), it is unstable for wavelengths long enough such that the pitch of the perturbation follows the pitch of the helix, i.e. the crests/troughs of the perturbations follow the fieldlines of tube\n\\[\nB_\\phi/R + k B_Z \\ge 0\n\\]\nIn terms of a twist \\(\\Phi = 2LB_\\phi/RB_z\\), this criterion is equivalent to\n\\[\nk\\ge-\\frac{\\Phi}{2L}\n\\]\nThe perturbation Lorentz force \\(\\mathbf{j}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_0\\) is zero. (???)\n\n\n13.7.4 Ballooning Mode\nThe ballooning instability is a type of internal pressure-driven plasma instability usually seen in tokamak fusion power reactors or in space plasmas (Hameiri, Laurence, and Mond 1991). It is important in fusion research as it determines a set of criteria for the maximum achievable plasma beta. The name refers to the shape and action of the instability, which acts like the elongations formed in a long balloon when it is squeezed. In literature, the structure of these elongations are commonly referred to as “fingers”.\nThe narrow fingers of plasma produced by the instability are capable of accelerating and pushing aside the surrounding magnetic field in order to cause a sudden, explosive release of energy. Thus, the instability is also known as the explosive instability.\nThe interchange instability can be derived from the equations of the ballooning instability as a special case in which the ballooning mode does not perturb the equilibrium magnetic field.(Hameiri, Laurence, and Mond 1991) This special limit is known as the Mercier criterion.\nKeyNotes.plot_balloon()\n\n\n13.7.5 Tearing Mode\nKeyNotes.plot_tearing()\nTearing mode is closely related to magnetic reconnection (Section 13.8). The reconnection process is very important because it is one of the main way of burst energy transformation. It is known that in collisionless systems current sheets are unstable against tearing instability, a process where the current tends to collapse into filaments. The tearing instability produces magnetic islands that then interact and merge together giving rise to a nonlinear instability phase, where the reconnection process is enhanced. See (Bellan 2008) P413 for more.\nLinear Tearing Mode\nConsider the interface between two plasmas containing magnetic fields of different orientations. The simplest imaginable field configuration is that illustrated in Figure 13.11. Here, the field varies only in the \\(x\\)-direction, and points only in the \\(y\\)-direction. The field is directed in the \\(-y\\)-direction for \\(x&lt;0\\), and in the \\(+y-\\)direction for \\(x&gt;0\\). The interface is situated at \\(x=0\\). The sudden reversal of the field direction across the interface gives rise to a \\(z\\)-directional current sheet at \\(x=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: A reconnection magnetic field configuration.\n\n\n\nWith the neglect of plasma resistivity, the field configuration shown in Figure 13.11 represents a stable equilibrium state, assuming, of course, that we have normal pressure balance across the interface. But, does the field configuration remain stable when we take resistivity into account? If not, we expect an instability to develop which relaxes the configuration to one possessing lower magnetic energy. As we shall see, this type of relaxation process inevitably entails the breaking and reconnection of magnetic field lines, and is, therefore, termed magnetic reconnection. The magnetic energy releases during the reconnection process eventually appears as plasma thermal energy. Thus, magnetic reconnection also involves plasma heating.\nIn the following, we shall outline the standard method for determining the linear stability of the type of magnetic field configuration shown in Figure 13.11, taking into account the effect of plasma resistivity. We are particularly interested in plasma instabilities which are stable in the absence of resistivity, and only grow when the resistivity is non-zero. Such instabilities are conventionally termed tearing modes. Since magnetic reconnection is, in fact, a nonlinear process, we shall then proceed to investigate the nonlinear development of tearing modes.\nThe equilibrium magnetic field is written \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_0=B_{0y}(x)\\hat{y}\n\\] where \\(B_{0y}(-x)=-B_{0y}(x)\\). There is assumed to be non-equilibrium plasma flow. The linearized equations of resistive-MHD, assuming incompressible flow, take the form \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}_0)+\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}\\nabla^2\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{13.12}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho_0\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla p +\\frac{(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B}_0}{\\mu_0}+\\frac{(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_0)\\times\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0}\n\\tag{13.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0\n\\tag{13.14}\\]\n\\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0\n\\tag{13.15}\\]\nHere, \\(\\rho_0\\) is the equilibrium plasma density, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the perturbed magnetic field, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) the perturbed plasma velocity, and \\(p\\) the perturbed plasma pressure. The assumption of incompressible plasma flow is valid provided that the plasma velocity associated with the instability remains significantly smaller than both the Alfvén velocity and the sonic velocity.\nSuppose that all perturbed quantities vary like \\[\nA(x,y,z,t)=A(x)e^{iky+\\gamma t}\n\\tag{13.16}\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the instability growth rate. The \\(x\\)-component of Equation 13.12 and the \\(z\\)-component of the curl of Equation 13.13 reduce to ??? \\[\n\\gamma B_x = ikB_{0y}v_x + \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}\\Big( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2\\Big)B_x\n\\tag{13.17}\\] \\[\n\\gamma \\rho_0 \\Big( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2 \\Big)v_x=\\frac{ikB_{0y}}{\\mu_0}\\Big( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2-\\frac{B_{0y}^{\\prime\\prime}}{B_{0y}}\\Big)B_x\n\\tag{13.18}\\] respectively, where use has been made of Equation 13.14 and Equation 13.15. Here, \\(\\prime\\) denotes \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}x\\).\nIt is convenient to normalize Equation 13.17 and Equation 13.18 using a typical magnetic field-strength, \\(B_0\\), and a typical scale-length, \\(a\\). Let us define the Alfvén time-scale \\[\n\\tau_A=\\frac{a}{V_A}\n\\] where \\(V_A=B_0/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho_0}\\) is the Alfvén velocity, and the resistive diffusion time-scale \\[\n\\tau_R=\\frac{\\mu_0 a^2}{\\eta}\n\\]\nThe ratio of these two time-scale is the Lundquist number: \\[\nS=\\frac{\\tau_R}{\\tau_A}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\psi= B_x/B_0\\), \\(\\phi = i\\,k\\,V_y/\\gamma\\), \\(\\bar{x}=x/a\\), \\(F=B_{0y}/B_0\\), \\(F'\\equiv dF/\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\bar{\\gamma} = \\gamma\\,\\tau_A\\), and \\(\\bar{k} = k\\,a\\). It follows that \\[\n\\bar{\\gamma}\\,(\\psi-F\\,\\phi) = S^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2}-\\bar{k}^2\\right) \\psi\n\\tag{13.19}\\] \\[\n\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2} -\\bar{k}^2\\right)\\phi = -\\bar{k}^2\\, F \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2} -\\bar{k}^2 - \\frac{F''}{F}\\right) \\psi\n\\tag{13.20}\\]\nThe term on the right-hand side of Equation 13.19 represents plasma resistivty, whilst the term on the left-hand side of Equation 13.20 represents plasma inertia.\nIt is assumed that the tearing instability grows on a hybrid time-scale which is much less than \\(\\tau_R\\) but much greater than \\(\\tau_A\\). It follows that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau_A \\ll \\gamma^{-1} \\ll \\tau_R \\\\\n\\gamma\\tau_A \\ll 1 \\ll \\gamma\\tau_R \\\\\n\\bar{\\gamma} \\ll 1 \\ll S\\,\\bar{\\gamma}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, throughout most of the plasma we can neglect the right-hand side of Equation 13.19 and the left-hand side of Equation 13.20, which is equivalent to the neglect of plasma resistivity and inertia. In this case, the two equations reduce to \\[\n\\phi = \\frac{\\psi}{F}\n\\tag{13.21}\\] \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\psi}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2} - \\bar{k}^2\\psi - \\frac{F''}{F}\\psi = 0\n\\tag{13.22}\\]\nEquation 13.21 is simply the flux freezing constraint, which requires the plasma to move with the magnetic field. Equation 13.22 is the linearized, static force balance criterion \\(\\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B})=0\\). These two equations are known collectively as the equations of ideal-MHD, and are valid throughout virtually the whole plasma. However, it is clear that these equations break down in the immediate vicinity of the interface, where \\(F=0\\) (i.e. where the magnetic field reverses direction). Witness, for instance, the fact that the normalized “radial” velocity, \\(\\phi\\), becomes infinite as \\(F\\rightarrow 0\\), according to Equation 13.21.\nThe ideal-MHD equations break down close to the interface because the neglect of plasma resistivity and inertia becomes untenable as \\(F\\rightarrow 0\\). Thus, there is a thin layer, in the immediate vicinity of the interface, \\(\\bar{x}=0\\), where the behaviour of the plasma is governed by the full MHD equations, Equation 13.19 and Equation 13.20. We can simplify these equations, making use of the fact that \\(\\bar{x}\\ll 1\\) and \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x} \\gg 1\\) in a thin layer, to obtain the following layer equations: \\[\n\\bar{\\gamma}\\,(\\psi - \\bar{x}\\,\\phi) = S^{-1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\psi}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2}\n\\tag{13.23}\\] \\[\n\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2} = - \\bar{x}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\psi}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}^2}\n\\tag{13.24}\\]\nNote that we have redefined the variables \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\bar{\\gamma}\\), and \\(S\\), such that \\(\\phi\\rightarrow F'(0)\\,\\phi\\), \\(\\bar{\\gamma}\\rightarrow \\gamma\\,\\tau_H\\), and \\(S\\rightarrow \\tau_R/\\tau_H\\). Here, \\[\n\\tau_H = \\frac{\\tau_A}{k\\,a\\,F'(0)}\n\\] is the hydromagnetic time-scale.\nThe tearing mode stability problem reduces to solving the non-ideal-MHD layer equations, Equation 13.23 and Equation 13.24, in the immediate vicinity of the interface, \\(\\bar{x}=0\\), solving the ideal-MHD equations, @Equation 13.21 and Equation 13.22, everywhere else in the plasma, matching the two solutions at the edge of the layer, and applying physical boundary conditions as \\(\\vert\\bar{x}\\vert\\rightarrow\\infty\\). This method of solution was first described in a classic paper (Furth, Killeen, and Rosenbluth 1963). The steps are listed in the farside note. The procedure is similar to the 3 layer solution of the K-H instability. After some maths, tearing mode dispersion relation is given as \\[\n\\gamma = \\left[\\frac{{\\Gamma}(1/4)}{2\\pi\\,{\\Gamma}(3/4)}\\right]^{4/5}\\, \\frac{({\\Delta}')^{4/5}}{\\tau_H^{2/5}\\,\\tau_R^{3/5}}\n\\] where \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\Delta} &= 2\\pi\\,\\frac{{\\Gamma}(3/4)}{{\\Gamma}(1/4)}\\,S^{1/3}\\, Q^{5/4} \\\\\nQ &= \\gamma\\,\\tau_H^{2/3}\\,\\tau_R^{1/3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe tearing mode is unstable whenever \\({\\Delta}'&gt;0\\), and grows on the hybrid time-scale \\(\\tau_H^{2/5}\\,\\tau_R^{3/5}\\).",

    "text": "13.8 Magnetic Reconnection\nMagnetic reconnection is one of the most complex processes known for converting energy from magnetic fields to particle motion. One of the key components in magnetic reconnection is the collision of two magnetic field regions with opposite-directed field lines, embedded in a plasma. The field and plasma combination forms an X-shaped configuration at their closest, and most intense point. Visualization of reconnections can be done from a field perspective or a particle perspective.\nThere are several key elements for understanding the physics of reconnection at a deeper level (Ji et al. 2022). First, the frozen-in properties in an electron-ion plasma are associated with the electron fluid due to its light weight. This is expressed in terms of the time changing rate of magnetic flux (Equation 7.47) through an arbitrary area, \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) (enclosed by loop \\(l\\)), convecting with the electron flow as \\(\\mathrm{d}\\Phi/\\mathrm{d}t = \\oint(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{u}_e\\times\\mathbf{B})\\cdot\\mathrm{d}l = 0\\). Thus, the frozen-in condition is regulated by the electron momentum equation (i.e. the generalized Ohm’s law) \\[\n\\underbrace{\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{V}_e\\times\\mathbf{B}}_{\\text{Ideal}} = \\underbrace{\\mathbf{R}_\\text{col}}_{\\text{Collisional}} - \\underbrace{\\frac{\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P}_e}{en} - \\frac{m_e}{e}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_e}{\\mathrm{d}t}}_{\\text{Kinetic}}\n\\tag{13.25}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{R}_\\text{col}\\) is the collisional force per electron charge. In a fully ionized collisional plasma, \\(\\mathbf{R}_\\text{col}\\approx \\eta\\mathbf{j}\\) where \\(\\eta\\) is the resistivity due to Coulomb collisions. If the terms on the right-hand side of Equation 13.25 are negligible, then \\(\\mathrm{d}\\Phi/\\mathrm{d}t \\approx 0\\) and the magnetic flux is “frozen-in” to the electron flow. For the generic reconnection layer illustrated in the middle panel of Figure 13.12, deviations from ideal evolution occur within the “diffusion region” (blue), where either finite resistivity or kinetic effects (electron inertia and pressure tensor) are important. Within the diffusion region, field lines converging from opposite sides of the layer can change connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.12: Magnetic reconnection within a current sheet (depicted at the center) features inflows (\\(V_\\text{in}\\)) of plasma with density \\(\\rho\\) and reconnecting magnetic field \\(B_0\\), outflows (\\(V_\\text{out}\\)) on order of Alfvén speed \\(V_A\\), and a diffusion region (with a length of \\(2L\\) and a thickness of \\(2\\Delta\\)) where field lines change connectivity. Magnetic separatrices (red) are field lines marking the topological boundary between the upstream flux and the downstream flow jet. Top panels display reconnection phases that have been confirmed in the laboratory experiments: single X-line collisional, single X-line collisionless, and multiple X-line collisionless. Here R and Z are radial and axial coordinates, respectively, in Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) where these data were taken. \\(B_Y\\) and \\(J_Y\\) are out-of-the-plane field and current density, respectively. Bottom panels illustrate cartoons of plasmoid mediated and 3D turbulent reconnection, both of which are expected to exhibit some degree of self-similarity. Figure 2 from (Ji et al. 2022).\n\n\n\nThe next key element for understanding the physics of magnetic reconnection is to grasp the remarkable global consequences of changing field line connectivity within a localized region. In particular, the newly reconnected field lines have a large curvature \\(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B}\\) which produces a tension force — closely analogous to a stretched rubber band. Allowing for the possibility of pressure anisotropy, the MHD momentum equation perpendicular to magnetic field is \\[\n\\rho\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{u}_\\perp}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\nabla_\\perp\\left( p_\\perp + \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right) + \\left( 1+\\frac{p_\\perp - p_\\parallel}{B^2/\\mu_0}\\right)\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{col}\\perp}\n\\tag{13.26}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{F}_\\text{col}\\) is due to collisions between ions (viscous force) and between ions and neutral particles (frictional force). For newly reconnected field lines, the magnetic tension in Equation 13.26 drives an outflow jet approaching the Alfvén speed \\(V_\\text{out} \\approx V_A \\equiv B_0/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}\\) (\\(B_0\\) is the reconnecting field component). The resulting deficit in magnetic pressure pushes new field lines into the diffusion region with a maximum inflow velocity \\(V_\\text{in}\\sim (0.01 \\rightarrow 0.1) V_A\\). As this process continues, the larger stressed region is relaxed, leading to a reconfiguration of the global magnetic field on fast Alfvénic time scales \\(\\sim L/V_A\\). Assuming the diffusion regions remain small in comparison to the global scales, most plasma enters the flow jet across the magnetic separatrices as illustrated in Figure 13.12. This inflow is a consequence of changing the field line connectivity within the diffusion region, which causes the entire extent of the reconnected field lines to join the outflow. In this limit, the majority of the energy release is associated with the relaxation of field-line tension within outflow jets over long distances. Since the spatial extent of these jets is limited only by the macroscopic configuration, they are one of the most prominent signatures of reconnection in both in-situ and remote-sensing observations. Our primary focus is on situations where the available magnetic energy to drive reconnection is comparable or larger than the initial plasma thermal energy, corresponding to \\(\\beta\\equiv p/(B_0^2/2\\mu_0)\\lesssim 1\\). In these regimes, global relaxation of field-line tension is the ultimate “engine” for reconnection and is essentially “ideal”, thus operating in a similar manner for most applications, but with a few important exceptions. Plasma heating preferentially along the magnetic field (\\(p_\\parallel\\gg p_\\perp\\)) can weaken the magnetic tension force in Equation 13.26, whereas in partially ionized regimes the jet formation is more complicated due to interactions with neutrals. In addition, non-ideal kinetic physics may persist along magnetic separatrices (see red lines in Figure 13.12) to larger distances, while in very large systems shocks may form along these boundaries and play a role in the energy conversion.\nIn contrast to the ideal physics driving the jet, the non-ideal terms within the diffusion region are intimately dependent upon the plasma conditions and spatial scales, and thus, a variety of different regimes are possible, as illustrated in the various panels of Figure 13.12. Since the outflow is always energetically limited to \\(V_A\\) in a quasi-steady state, mass conservation implies that the geometry of the diffusion region determines the dimensionless reconnection rate, \\(R \\equiv u_\\mathrm{in}/V_A \\approx \\Delta/L\\) where \\(\\Delta\\) is the diffusion region thickness. The current understanding of the diffusion region physics has evolved over more than 60 years in three main stages, yet a full understanding remains elusive for large space and astrophysical problems.\n\n13.8.1 Reconnection Rate\nReconnection rate quantifies the amount of magnetic flux transportation through the X-line. There are two kinds of reconnection rate (Nakamura et al. 2018):\n\nThe dimensional reconnection rate, defined as the out-of-plane electric (usually denoted as \\(E_r\\) or \\(E_y\\) for a 2D X-Z plane configuration, with a unit of [V/m]) at the X-line for steady state reconnection: \\[\nE_r \\equiv E_y \\sim U_\\mathrm{in}B_\\mathrm{in}\\sim U_\\mathrm{out}B_\\mathrm{out}\n\\tag{13.27}\\]\n\nSteady state is necessary for balancing the inflowing and outflowing flux and a uniform \\(E_r\\). \\(E_r\\) defines the rate at which the magnetic flux is transferred from the inflow region into the diffusion region to change the field line connectivity. Therefore, the reconnection electric field is also referred to as the dimensional reconnection rate.\n\nThe dimensionless reconnection rate, defined as the ratio between the inflow speed and the ion Alfvén speed based on the background reconnecting field strength \\(B_b\\) and the upstream density: \\[\nR \\equiv \\frac{U_\\mathrm{in}}{V_{Aib}}\n\\tag{13.28}\\]\n\nBecause of the magnetic flux conservation in ideal MHD, \\(B_\\mathrm{in}U_\\mathrm{in}=B_\\mathrm{out}U_\\mathrm{out}\\). Assuming \\(B_\\mathrm{in}\\sim B_b\\) and \\(U_\\mathrm{out}\\sim V_{Aib}\\), the normalized reconnection rate can be approximately written by using the unnormalized rate \\(E_r\\sim U_\\mathrm{in}B_\\mathrm{in}\\) as \\[\nR = \\frac{U_\\mathrm{in}}{V_{Aib}} \\sim \\frac{E_r}{V_{Aib}B_b} \\sim \\frac{E_r}{V_\\mathrm{out}B_b}\n\\]\nThe inflow speed shall be taken near the reconnection site. Observationally, this ratio is on the order of \\(\\mathcal{O}(0.1)\\). There has been some theoretical arguments based on geometry to explain this universal ratio in recent years. We shall also note that magnetic flux is not conserved close to the center of X-line, in regions typically known as the ion diffusion region and electron diffusion region.\nFor global magnetosphere studies, a useful concept called reconnection efficiency \\(\\epsilon\\) is defined as ratio of the imposed potential drop to the full possible potential drop across the width of the magnetosphere. The potential drop is calculated from integrating \\(E_r\\) along the X-line. As an example, Ganymede has been observed to possess an unusually high reconnection efficiency about 60% (Zhou et al. 2020), compared to about 10% measured by cross polar cap potential (CPCP) over the full possible potential drop at Earth. High \\(\\epsilon\\) means more plasmas penetrating inside the magnetosphere instead of diverting around the magnetopause.1\nIt is important to note that high reconnection efficiency does not indicate high dimensionless reconnection rate. For instance, in a 2D steady state magnetosphere reconnection, the global reconnection efficiency must be 1, otherwise the system cannot be steady. However, the local dimensionless reconnection rate can still be 0.1, measured from either the speed ratio or the ratio of \\(B_N\\) in the LMN coordinate system to the total magnetic field strength right inside the magnetopause (B. Ö. Sonnerup 1974).\n\n\n13.8.2 Hall Field\nLet X be the inflow direction, Z the outflow direction, and Y the out-of-plane direction. During magnetic reconnection,\n\na quadrupolar out-of-plane or Hall magnetic field \\(B_y\\) is formed by the field aligned currents \\(j_\\parallel\\) that flow in the vicinity of the magnetic separatrices when ion and electrons decouple on the length scales less than the ion inertial length (B. U. Ö. Sonnerup 1979). The quadruple Hall magnetic field was analyzed as a tearing mode eigenmode of the current layer (Terasawa 1983). The Hall effect introduces a coupling between the tearing mode perturbations (2D configuration in-plane \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) components) and shear Alfvén mode perturbations (out-of-plane \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) component).\nIn the context of collisionless plasmas, ion-electron collisions are absent so that ions and electrons behave differently at micro-scale. On the ion scale, ions start to become demagnetized whereas electrons are still coupled to the magnetic field. The difference in the ion and electron motion produces charge separation, Hall electric fields and the associated electric current. (On the even smaller electron-scale, electrons are demagnetized and correspond to the “breaking” of the field line.) The spatial variation of Hall electric fields is mostly in X, normal to and pointing towards the current layer. Relevance of Hall effects in reconnection is considered important at the ion inertial scale, providing a source for non-ideal reconnection electric field. (In observations, the perpendicular scale of the Hall fields and current layer can be as small as electron scales as well?) The parallel scale of the Hall fields are much larger. Equivalently, Hall fields are associated with a wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) so that \\(k_x\\gg k_z\\) and \\(1/k_x\\) on the ion-scale.\n\nThe Hall fields are continuously produced quasi-steady structures accompanied with a timescale much longer than the ion gyroperiod. Their associated kinetic and magnetic energies propagate away from the reconnection layers carried by Alfvén waves. Numerical simulations suggest that it is primarily kinetic Alfvén waves (KAW, Section 10.9.4) which are excited in the vicinity of reconnection regions (Rogers+, 2001; Shay+, 2011), but further downstream in the exhaust it is primarily shear Alfvén waves (Gurram, Egedal, and Daughton 2021).\nIn observations, signatures of Hall magnetic fields are used as a working definition of collisionless magnetic reconnection in the Earth’s and planetary magnetosphere. The bipolar/quadrupolar Hall magnetic field \\(B_y\\) can coexist with a guide field (i.e. constant \\(B_y\\)) (for an example at Mars, see (Wang et al. 2023)).\n(Dai and Wang 2023) emphasized that the physics underlying the Hall effect is similar to that in KAW:\n\nBoth can be described by the two-fluid equations.\nThe temporal and spatial scales of Hall fields are exactly the same as those of KAW.\nThe polarity of the Hall electric field (in X) and the Hall magnetic field (in Y) is also consistent with that of KAW.\nThe ratio \\(E_x / B_y\\) of Hall fields is on the order of \\(V_A\\), similar to KAW.\nThe current system of Hall fields are in the XZ-plane.\n\nAs the perpendicular wavelength of Alfvén wave becomes comparable to the ion gyroradius, the ions cannot follow the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift. This is because the wave electric field now is non-uniform in the trajectory of ion gyromotion. As a consequence, the ion transverse motion is modified by the finite-Larmor-radius (FLR) effect. Considering the kinetic correction, the ion actually follows \\(\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{V}_i\\times\\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{n_i q_i}\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P}_i\\) in the transverse motion. The FLR effect is manifested in the ion pressure gradient term: the FLR effect is equivalent to a finite temperature for the ions on the fluid level. At the wavelength of ion-scale wavelength, electrons cannot follow ions in the transverse motion. The difference in the transverse motion of ions and electrons produces a charge separation and coupling to the electrostatic mode, and a quasi-electrostatic electric field is formed in the transverse direction. To remain quasi-neutral, electrons quickly move in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. In the parallel direction, these electrons undergo a force balance between a small parallel electric field and the electron pressure gradient in the case of KAW. The parallel motion of electrons created a field-aligned current (FAC) that is a distinct nature of Alfvén mode. The FAC induces a wave magnetic field perpendicular to the DC (background) magnetic field. A new physical scale length \\(r_{iL}\\), the ion gyroradius based on the electron temperature, for the current layer and outflow layer in fast reconnection. Through the diffusion region near the X-line, intense KAW turbulence is observed, suggesting that magnetic reconnection is a source of KAW. Thus KAW has been invoked as ingredients for fast reconnection.\nIn the direction parallel to the magnetic field (\\(\\hat{z}\\)), \\(B_y\\) reverses but \\(E_x\\) remains its sign. This feature is related to the superposition of two KAW mode waves that propagate in the opposite direction and outward from the reconnection region. In the perpendicular direction, the Hall fields appears to exist only for one wavelength along \\(\\hat{x}\\). This is related to the eigenmode (standing mode) structure of KAW in the current layer.\nIn the literature, the Hall electric field is usually considered to arise from the \\(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}/n_e q\\) term in the context of the generalized Ohm’s law Equation 8.27. The Hall term starts to become important at the ion inertial scale, contributing to the Hall electric field. Interestingly, the \\(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) also represents a major force term in the one-fluid MHD momentum equation. The \\(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) force could be important on the large MHD-scale and the argument for the origin of Hall electric field becomes ambiguous; from the MHD momentum equation, \\(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) term is equivalent to the ion inertial effect, ion pressure effect and the electron pressure effect: \\[\n\\rho\\frac{{d\\mathbf{u}}}{dt}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\overleftrightarrow{P}_i+\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e)=\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{13.29}\\]\nwhich is derived from the sum of the two-fluid momentum equations multiplied by the mass of each species. The one-fluid MHD momentum equation Equation 13.29 together with the general Ohm’s law is nearly equivalent (with some extent of reduction?) to the two-fluid momentum for two species. The Hall electric field is equivalently described by either set of equations.\nFrom the ion momentum equation \\[\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_i\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{n_i q_i}\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_i + \\frac{m_i}{q_i}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_i}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{13.30}\\]\nThe perpendicular component of the non-ideal electric field \\(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_i\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) is the Hall electric field at the ion kinetic scale; as seen on the RHS, two sources of Hall electric fields are the ion inertial term and the ion pressure gradient. From the KAW perspective, the Hall electric field is supported by the ion pressure gradient. In the regime of the temporal and spatial scale of KAW, the ion inertial term is small and on the order of \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\omega^2/\\Omega_i^2)\\).\nIf the ion inertial term is neglected, Equation 13.30 becomes \\[\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_i\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{n_i q_i}\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_i\n\\]\nThe \\(\\mathbf{u}_i\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) term is kept since the ion flow may not be neglected near the X-line.\n\n\n13.8.3 Kinetic Signatures of Diffusion Region\n(The following part is from [Kinetic signatures of the region surrounding the X-line in asymmetric (magnetopause) reconnection] and [Fluid and kinetics signatures of reconnection at the dawn tail magnetopause-Wind observations].)\nElectron diffusion region (EDR) is defined to be the electron-scale region surrounding the X-line in which magnetic connectivity is ultimately broken. Note that this definition is fundamentally non-local in nature.\n\nenhanced dissipation [e.g., Zenitani+, 2012]\nnon-gyrotropic particle behavior [e.g., Scudder+, 2008; Aunai+, 2013; Swisdak 2016]\nelectron distribution functions [e.g., Chen+, 2008, Ng+, 2011]\nIn the two inflow regions, we expect a reduction in total pressure, magnetic field \\(B_L\\) and the plasma density \\(n_i\\) relative to ambient upstream conditions.\n\nSome signatures also exist downstream of the diffusion region and along the separatrices. In practice people use a complementary approach for the identification.\nSpecifically for EDR, it should exhibit a number of properties:\n\nthe violation of the electron frozen-in condition\nnon-gyrotropic electron distributions [e.g., Scudder+, 2008; Aunai+, 2013; Swisdak 2016]\nenhanced dissipation [Zenitani+, 2011]\n\nA simple and practical indicator of EDR is the presence of a sunward pointing \\(E_N\\) at the midplane (called the “shoulder”) as this signature coincides with the region of enhanced dissipation, non-gyrotropic electrons at midplane, and counterstreaming electron beams due to electron meandering orbits around the X-line. This EN signature is straightforward to measure experimentally because it is the largest component of the electric field at the magnetopause.\nThe crescent shape distribution is not as localized as the \\(E_N\\) shoulder especially for ion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.13: Ion crescent shape distribution at Earth’s magnetopause revealed by ISEE satellite at 1981.\n\n\n\nAt the dayside magnetopause, reconnection between magnetosheath and geomagnetic field lines is expected to produce\n\na finite magnetic field component normal to the magnetopause, \\(B_N\\);\nAlfvénic plasma flow acceleration associated with a rotational discontinuity at the magnetopause;\nion distributions on reconnected field lines consisting of a mixture of magnetosheath and magnetosphere populations where the transmitted magnetosheath population has a “D-shaped” distribution, with a low-energy cutoff at the deHoffmann-Teller velocity [Cowley, 1982];\nreflected ions in the layers adjacent to the magnetopause;\nopposite streaming along reconnected field lines of outgoing magnetospheric electrons and incoming magnetosheath electrons, resulting in large parallel electron heat flux;\nan offset between the ion and electron edges at the inner boundary of the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) due to a time-of-flight effect resulting from the fact that entering magnetosheath electrons have much higher parallel speeds than ions while their transverse motions are the same.\n\n\n\n13.8.4 D-shape Distribution\nThe kinetic description of reconnection can also be quantitatively verified. An important kinetic signature is the “D-shaped” ion distribution. Magnetosheath particles can either be reflected at or cross the magnetopause. In the deHoffmann-Teller frame of reference in which the electric field vanishes, only ions traveling toward the magnetopause will cross the magnetopause. Thus, when viewed in the spacecraft frame, only magnetosheath ions with parallel velocity greater than the deHoffmann-Teller velocity can be seen earthward of the magnetopause, resulting in a “D-shaped” distribution. [Cowley, 1982]\nThe existence of a finite BN at the MP requires field lines on both sides of the MP to move together. In this scenario there must be a reference frame (the HT frame) which slides along the MP with the field-line velocity. In this frame, the convective electric field vanishes (\\(\\mathbf{E}_c= -\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}= 0\\)), i.e. the flows are field aligned on the two sides of the MP.\nIn practice, the HT frame for a set of plasma and field measurements across the MP can be found as the reference frame in which the mean square of the convective electric field, \\(D=\\left&lt;|(\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{V}_{HT})\\times\\mathbf{B}|^2\\right&gt;\\), is as small as possible. The angle bracket \\(&lt;...&gt;\\) denotes an average of an enclosed quantity over a set of measurements. The velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) for which \\(D(\\mathbf{v})\\) is a minimum is the deHoffmann-Teller velocity, \\(\\mathbf{V}_{HT}\\). The ratio \\(D/D_0\\), where \\(D_0=\\left&lt;|(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}^|2\\right&gt;\\), is used as a measure of the quality of the HT frame. For a good HT frame \\(D/D_0\\) should be small (\\(\\ll 1\\)).\nIn another paper [Characteristics of the flank magnetopause: Cluster observations], \\(\\mathbf{V}_{HT}\\) is defined by minimizing \\(\\mathbf{E}^\\prime = \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{V}_{HT}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\), and the correlation between \\(\\mathbf{E}_c=-\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}_{HT}=-\\mathbf{V}_{HT}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) describes how well the frame is determined.\n\n\n13.8.5 Classification of Discontinuity Types\nIn a fluid description, the magnetopause can be described either as a tangential discontinuity (TD) or as a rotational discontinuity (RD). A TD implies a complete separation of two plasma regimes (in this case the magnetosheath on one side and the magnetosphere on the other side). The boundary as a whole may move, but there is no transport of plasma across the discontinuity, and there is no magnetic field along the boundary normal. An RD-like magnetopause, on the other hand, implies transport across the boundary and a normal magnetic field, and indicates the presence of reconnection. In the vicinity of the X-line, the plasma flow is Alfvénic, i.e., the Walén relation is satisfied: \\[\n\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{V}_{HT} = \\pm\\mathbf{V}_A\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the plasma velocity, \\(\\mathbf{V}_{HT}\\) is the deHoffmann-Teller frame velocity, and \\(\\mathbf{V}_A\\) is the local Alfvén velocity.\nIn some other literature, a more complete form is written as \\[\n\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{V}_{HT} = \\pm(1-\\alpha)^{1/2}\\mathbf{V}_A\n\\]\nwhich takes the pressure anisotropy factor \\(\\alpha=(p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)\\mu_0 / B^2\\) into account.\nThis is often used to classify the discontinuity type of the magnetopause. For an RD, the flow across the boundary is proportional to the normal magnetic field, i.e., \\(v_n \\propto B_n\\). A positive (negative) slope of the regression means that normal magnetic field and flow have the same (opposite) signs. At the magnetopause, we can assume that the flow is inward, i.e., from the magnetosheath into the magnetosphere.\n\n\n13.8.6 Reconnection Efficiency\nThis is very confusing. From [Kivelson+ 1997]:\n\nThere is an interesting link between flow speeds over the polar cap and reconnection efficiency at the nose of its magnetopause. This follows from the fact that the voltage drop across the magnetosphere is a fraction of the voltage drop across the same distance in the corotating flow upstream. Thus, the convection electric field within the magnetosphere is a fraction of the corotation electric field determined by the efficiency of reconnection. The model allows us to estimate the convective flow speeds of plasma over the polar cap if the reconnection efficiency is known, and conversely allows us to estimate the reconnection efficiency if the flow speed over the polar cap is known.\n\nLet me think in this way: the convective electric field in the upstream, \\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\), describes how many magnetic field lines are moving into the reconnection site at a given point. The integral of electric field along the X-line describes how many magnetic field lines are getting reconnected into the magnetosphere. This is not the same as electric potential drop, where in the simplest cases requires a static EM field. Because of the difficulty of finding the separatrices, we use an indirect approach assuming equi-potential field lines to calculate the electric field along the magnetosphere boundary curve away from the reconnection site.\nBe careful for the word “cross polar cap potential” here. This may be a misleading term, since how can one define an electric potential in a EM field?\n\n\n13.8.7 Dissipation Mechanisms\nPerhaps the most import problem associated with reconnection is the understanding of the mechanisms by which the magnetic field can dissipate its energy, and subsequently produce particle heating and acceleration [Huba 1979]. Since many field reversed plasmas are essentially collisionless, instabilities are likely to play an important role in the dissipation process.\nA macroinstability (MHD type), like the tearing mode can dissipate magnetic energy even in a collisionless plasma via electron inertia, electron or ion Landau damping. However, the collisionless tearing mode saturates at a very small amplitude. Microinstabilities can also dissipate magnetic energy by producing an anomalous resistivity which can either dissipate the magnetic energy directly or enhance the growth of the tearing mode.\nIn any case, the kinetic physics corresponding to the fast rate of collisionless reconnection is a long-standing question. Non-gyrotropy particle distributions and the associated off-diagonal term of the pressure tensor have been considered to provide the reconnection electric field at electron-scale and ion-scale.\nThe lower-hybrid-drift instability (LHDI, Section 13.9) is often considered to be an important microinstability for dissipation near the diffusion region.\n\n\n13.8.8 Sweet-Parker Solution\nFrom Yi-Hsin Liu’s presentation of space weather.\nmass conservation: \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot(n\\mathbf{V})=0 \\Rightarrow\\ V_{in}L \\simeq V_{out}\\delta\n\\]\nmomentum conservation: \\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B}}{4\\pi} = nm_i \\mathbf{V}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{V} \\Rightarrow V_{out}\\simeq \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{4\\pi nm_i}} = V_A\n\\]\nnormalized reconnection rate \\[\nR\\equiv\\frac{V_{in}}{V_A}\\sim\\frac{\\delta}{L}\n\\]\nHowever, this model has a small \\(\\delta/L\\), the rate is too small to explain the time-scales in solar flare. To explain the flares, it requires \\(R\\sim 0.1\\).\n\n\n13.8.9 Petschek Solution\nReconnection in this model is much larger because \\(R\\sim \\delta/L\\) goes up. However, this is not a self-consistent solution.\nIn PIC simulations, the diffusion region is localized like the Petschek solution. The reason we use PIC instead of MHD is that PIC captures the key physics that breaks the frozen-in condition in nature. In the GEM challenge study, PIC, hybrid, Hall-MHD, MHD with a localized artificial resistivity all give similar \\(R\\sim 0.1\\) fast reconnection rate in disparate systems. In terms of the pressure descriptions from the moment equations, it has been found that 6-moment cannot trigger fast reconnection while 10-moment can, which essentially indicates that the off-diagonal terms in the pressure tensor is critical in getting the right physics.\nOne possible explanation for this \\(0.1\\) rate comes from geometrical consideration. In the small \\(\\delta/L\\) limit, \\(R\\sim\\delta/L\\sim0\\). In the large \\(\\delta/L\\) limit, \\(\\delta/L\\rightarrow 1\\), \\(R\\rightarrow0\\). It turns out that there should be an optimized \\(R_{\\text{max}}\\) in between. In the large \\(\\delta/L\\) limit, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B}}{4\\pi}\\simeq \\frac{\\nabla(B^2)}{8\\pi} + nm_i\\mathbf{V}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{V}\n\\]\nAt the inflow region, the large angle decrease the reconecting magnetic field. At the outlfow region, it decrease the outflow speed. Both of them cause \\(R\\) to decrease. Constraints imposed at the inflow and outflow region (upper) bound the rate! In [Liu+, PRL 2017], an analytical expression of \\(R\\) is given by \\[\nR\\equiv\\frac{V_{in}}{V_A}\\simeq \\frac{\\delta}{L}\\cdot \\underbrace{\\Big[ \\frac{1-(\\delta/L)^2}{1+(\\delta/L)^2} \\Big]}_{\\text{reduction of reconnection B}}\\cdot \\underbrace{\\sqrt{1-\\Big( \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\Big)^2}}_{\\text{reduction of }V_{out}}\n\\]\nReconnection tends to proceed near the most efficient state with \\(R\\sim\\mathcal{O}(0.1)\\). Nicely, the rate is insensitive to \\(\\delta/L\\) near this state (BECAUSE THE SLOPE IS SMALL???).\nAmitava Bhattacharjee argued that scaling is a controversial subject:\n\nHow does it scale with ion/electron skin depth, resistivity, plasma beta, and system size?\nIs the reconnection rate insensitive to the details of the electron layer (current sheet layer), and controlled by ions?\n\n\nThe whistler waves generate an out-of-plane quadrupolar magnetic field.\nThe ratio of the horizontal electron outflow to the horizontal magnetic perturbation scales as \\(k\\) for the dispersive whistler (or kinetic Alfvén) wave. (WHICH WAVE IS IT? I have been confused by the relation between whistler waves ann KAWs. Both contains a region with super-Alfvénic phase speed for large \\(k\\) and especially with frequency between \\(\\Omega_i\\) and \\(\\Omega_e\\); whister wave involves electrons whereas KAW can only rely on ions.)\n\nFrom the GEM Challenge perspective:\n\nReconnection is insensitive to the mechanism that breaks field lines (electron inertia or resistivity). The length of the reconnection layer \\(\\Delta_i\\sim 10 d_i\\). Reconnection rate is a “universal constant”, \\(V_in\\approx 0.1 V_A\\).\nIn the presence of Hall currents, whistler waves mediate reconnection. The characteristic outflow speed is the whistler phase speed (based on the upstream magnetic field).\nThe inflow velocity \\(v_\\text{in}=\\Omega_e\\delta_e^2/\\Delta_i\\) where \\(\\Delta_i\\sim k^{-1}\\ll L\\) (system size). This rate is independent of \\(m_e\\).\n\nThe GEM perspective is not universally accepted. An alternate point of view provides evidence that:\n\nReconnection is not a universal constant, and depends on system parameters (such as ion/electron skin depth, plasma beta, boundary conditions).\nReconnection rate is not independent of the system size, and in fact, often decreases as the system size increases.\n\nHe provided three examples:\n\nForced reconnection without guide field\nUndriven reconnection with guide field\nUndriven reconnection with open boundaries\n\n\n\n13.8.10 3D Nature of Reconnection\nHow about the freedom coming from the extra dimension?\nDistinct 3D features, including\n\nflux ropes\nkink instability\nturbulence\n\n3D diffusion region can be fundamentally different. For example, you may find bifurcation of electron diffusion region in 3D reconnection simulations. Clue: bifurcated layer is located in between these intertwined flux ropes, and tearing modes give rise to these flux ropes! 2D only allows the parallel tearing mode, i.e., no bifurcation. 3D allows a spectrum of oblique tearing modes, unlike 2D.\n3D reconnection has always been a mystery to me. People have the concepts of 2D reconnection for so long (guide field on v.s. guide field off) which makes it hard for us to understand the 3D nature of reconnection. A fair question to ask is: what differentiate a guide field from the reconnecting field?",

    "text": "13.9 Lower Hybrid Drift Instability\nThe lower-hybrid-drift instability (LHDI) is a microinstability which has thought to be an anomalous transport mechanism in both laboratory and space plasmas. The local linear theory of this instability is well understood. The mode is driven by the diamagnetic current produced by pressure inhomogeneities and is characterized at maximum growth by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega\\sim kV_d \\lesssim \\omega_{lh} \\\\\n\\gamma\\lesssim \\omega \\\\\nk \\sim \\omega_{lh}/v_i \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(V_d\\) is the diamagnetic drift velocity, \\(\\omega_{lh}\\) is the lower hybrid frequency, and \\(v_i\\) is the ion thermal velocity.\n\\[\n\\omega_{lh} = [(\\Omega_i \\Omega_e)^{-1} + \\omega_{pi}^{-2}]^{-1/2}\n\\] where \\(\\Omega_i\\) is the ion cyclotron frequency, \\(\\Omega_e\\) is the electron cyclotron frequency, and \\(\\omega_{pi}\\) is the ion plasma frequency. It is so called “hybrid” because it is a mixture of two frequencies. It is unusual in that the ion and electron masses play an equally important role.\nThe drift velocity is \\[\nV_d = \\frac{\\nabla p\\times \\mathbf{B}}{neB^2}\n\\]\nPhysically, the instability is reactive (fluid-like) in the strong drift velocity regime (\\(V_d &gt; v_i\\)) and dissipative (kinetic) in the weak drift velocity regime (\\(V_d &lt; v_i\\)). The pressure inhomogeneities can be caused by either temperature or density inhomogeneities, or both.\nThe corresponding lower hybrid (LH) waves are electrostatic emissions near the LH resonant frequency. They propagate perpendicularly with a small wavelength comparable to Larmor radius of thermal particles and can be capable of heating both ions and electrons. In the cold plasma regime (Section 10.7), the LH waves (with the frequency above LH resonance frequency) and whistler-mode waves belong to the same wave mode branch.",

For the strong magnetic field approximation, the two pressures are related to the plasma density and the magnetic field strength by two adiabatic equations, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{p_\\parallel B^2}{\\rho^3} \\right) &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{p_\\perp}{\\rho B} \\right) &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is also known as the double adiabatic theory, which is also what many people remember to be the key conclusion from the CGL theory ((Chew, Goldberger, and Low 1956), Equation 8.43 and Equation 8.45). Here I want to emphasize the meaning of adiabatic again: this assumes zero heat flux. If the system is not adiabatic, the conservation of these two quantities related to the parallel and perpendicular pressure is no longer valid, and additional terms may come into play such as the stochastic heating.\nNow imagine an increasing magnetic field \\(B\\). For an initially Maxwellian distributed plasma like a circle in the phase space, it will get stretched in the perpendicular direction and become an oval; conversely, if the magnetic field is decreasing, it will get stretched in the parallel direction.\n\n13.11.1 Firehose Instability\nThe firehose mode is the result of a pressure (or temperature) anisotropy in plasma with the parallel pressure \\(P_\\parallel\\) exceeding the perpendicular \\(P_\\perp\\) and magnetic \\(B^2/2\\mu_0\\) pressures. Sagdeev [1966] gave a simple intuitive explanation of this instability based on the insight that the parallel thermal motion of the adiabatic magnetised ions along the magnetic field exerts a centrifugal force on the field lines. When this force exceeds the restoring forces of the magnetic pressure and perpendicular plasma pressure, the centrifugal force wins and a small excursion of the magnetic field starts growing and propagates as a wave along the magnetic flux tube like on a string. The condition for instability is \\[\nP_\\parallel - P_\\perp &gt; B^2 / \\mu_0\n\\]\nSince the pressure anisotropy on the left means that there is an excess in parallel energy in the plasma, the plasma possesses free energy which by the instability is fed into the excitation of Alfvén waves with frequencies \\(\\omega_A \\ll \\omega_{ci}\\), transported away with Alfvén speed and ultimately dissipated in some way. The waves excited are ordinary Alfvén waves.\nIf a wave growth is associated with small groups of resonant particles, then the corresponding instability is known a resonant mode. The firehose mode is non-resonant since all particles contribute to it. Generally most non-resonant instabilities can only be found by solving the full dispersion relation numerically.\nSee more in Section 14.1.\n\n\n13.11.2 Mirror Instability\nSouthwood & Kivelson had a nice paper explaining the physics of mirror instability. See also Section 14.2 for a more thorough mathematical description of the instability.\nThe mirror instability is prevalent in planetary and cometary magnetosheaths and other high \\(\\beta\\) environment. It is recognized as one of the two magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that occur in the presence of extreme velocity space (pitch angle) anisotropy in a uniform plasma, the other instability being the firehose. The mirror mode has gained increasing interest following its identification in spacecraft data from the magnetosheath and solar wind. Although the instability was originally derived from magnetohydrodynamic fluid theory, later work showed that there were significant differences between the fluid theory and a more rigorous kinetic approach, as we will see in Section 14.2.\nThe instability occurs when \\(\\beta\\), the ratio of plasma to magnetic pressure. The anisotropy \\((p_\\perp - p_\\parallel)/p_\\parallel\\) required for instability \\(\\propto \\beta^{-1}\\). In planetary magnetosheaths the source of anisotropy is likely to be the planetary bow shock and in cometary environments the ion pickup process is a natural source of anisotropy. Both types of environment tend to have relatively large values of \\(\\beta\\).\nAny nonlinear saturation mechanism of the mirror instability is likely to leave the plasma spatially structured, as is also strongly suggested by the many observations. In practice, in almost any experimental detection of a plasma instability, the wave fields and the plasma population will have evolved to some quasi-steady condition that represents a nonlinear saturated state of the instability. In the spatially structured magnetic field associated with the minor instability in both its linear and nonlinear phase, different parts of the ion distribution will resonate with an ion cyclotron wave as the wave propagates along the inhomogeneous field. This effect is likely to inhibit the growth of the ion cyclotron mode, which theoretically also exists in the same frequency band.\nThe mirror instability is referred to as a “fluid” instability, alluding to the fact that the phase space (pitch angle) anisotropy of the bulk of the hot plasma distribution serves as the source of energy. The instability grows because of a subtle coupling between a group of particles with small velocity parallel to the field and the rest of the population. The mirror instability has zero parallel phase velocity in the plasma frame of reference. It follows, by analogy with other uses of the term that we can call particles with near zero parallel velocity resonant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.14: Illustration of mirror instability.\n\n\n\n(Song+ 1994) presented a set of identification criteria for distinguishing among various forms of high \\(\\beta\\) MHD waves, with mirror modes having the properties:\n\nCompressional fluctuations: \\[\n(\\delta\\mathbf{B}^2 - \\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\parallel^2) / \\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\parallel^2 &lt; 1\n\\]\nAnti-correlated \\(\\delta Pi\\) and \\(\\delta P_B\\): \\[\n\\delta P_i / \\delta P_B &lt; 0\n\\]\nLinear magnetic field polarization\nStationary in plasma rest frame (i.e. zero phase speed): \\[\n\\Big(\\delta \\mathbf{v}^2 / \\mathbf{v}_0^2 \\Big) / \\Big( \\delta \\mathbf{B}^2 / \\mathbf{B}_0^2 \\Big) \\approx 0\n\\]\n\nThe last criterion is referred to as the Doppler ratio and is used to distinguish between slow mode waves (value \\(\\ge 1\\)) and mirror modes (value near zero).\nNote that mirror mode is not really a MHD mode, but from observation in the Earth’s magnetosheath we often see mirror modes on large MHD scales. However, in the solar wind, mirror mode structures seem to be much smaller than those observed in the magnetosheath. From Equation 14.20, electron physics may be involved on the electron scales.\nIt is still an unknown mystery from MMS observation that downstream of an interplanetary shock, very few mirror modes were observed. This is surprising, because usually the shock is a source of pressure anisotropy. Another explained fact is that typically mirror modes are not observed during fast solar wind (as of 2022).\n\n\n13.11.3 Weibel Instability\nThe Weibel instability is a plasma instability present in homogeneous or nearly homogeneous electromagnetic plasmas which possess an anisotropy in velocity space. This anisotropy is most generally understood as two temperatures in different directions, and the generalization extends to superposition of many counter-streaming beams. In this sense, it is like the two-stream instability except that the perturbations are electromagnetic and result in filamentation as opposed to electrostatic perturbations which would result in charge bunching. In the linear limit the instability causes exponential growth of electromagnetic fields in the plasma which help restore momentum space isotropy.\nCheck Wiki for an illustration of Weibel instability in a simple configuration. Chen (2016) also has a section on this.\nWeibel instability is common in astrophysical plasmas, such as collisionless shock formation in supernova remnants and \\(\\gamma\\)-ray bursts.",

This is a resonant instability in which the energy for the instability is fed from a subset of the particle population that are in gyroresonance with the unstable wave.\nFrom Earth’s magnetosheath observations, mirror modes dominates even though the linear dispersion relation predicts a smaller growth rate compared with EMIC waves. Gary argued in the 1990s that this is because of a small portion of heavier species (e.g. helium) that modifies the growth rate. Local hybrid simulations (e.g. the example from hybrid VPIC in ISSS14) supports this. However, researchers have not reached a consensus on whether ion cyclotron instability suppress mirror instability or vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nBellan, Paul M. 2008. Fundamentals of Plasma Physics.

    "text": "14.2 Mirror Instability: Linear Theory\nLet us go back to Equation 14.13 and Equation 14.14 and get apart from Alfvénic what other perturbations there are and when they are stable. We have already looked at the Alfvénic perturbation \\(\\delta\\hat{b}=\\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\perp/B\\). Now consider \\[\n\\frac{\\delta B}{B} = \\frac{\\delta B_\\parallel}{B}\n\\tag{14.17}\\]\nFrom Equation 14.13, we have the perpendicular compression increases B: \\[\n\\omega\\frac{\\delta B}{B} = \\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\n\\]\nTake \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\) Equation 14.14: \\[\n\\omega\\rho\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{u}_\\perp = \\rho\\omega^2 \\frac{\\delta B}{B} = k_\\perp^2\\Big( \\delta p_\\perp + \\frac{B\\delta B}{\\mu_0} \\Big) + k_\\parallel^2\\Big( p_\\perp - p_\\parallel + \\frac{B^2}{\\mu_0} \\Big) \\frac{\\delta B}{B}\n\\tag{14.18}\\]\nNote the \\(p_\\perp\\) term here: we need kinetic theory to calculate this!

Now when we perturb everything: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_s(\\mu,\\epsilon) &= F_{0s}(\\mu,\\epsilon) + \\delta F_s \\\\\n&= f_{0s}(w_\\perp,w_\\parallel) + \\delta f_s \\\\\n&= f_{0s}\\Big( \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu(B_0+\\delta B)}{m_s}},\\sqrt{\\frac{2[\\epsilon-\\mu(B_0+\\delta B)]}{m_s}} \\Big) + \\delta f_s \\\\\n&= f_{0s}\\Big( \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu B_0}{m_s}}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\delta B}{B_0}},\\sqrt{\\frac{2(\\epsilon-\\mu B_0)}{m_s}}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{m_s\\mu\\delta B}{(\\epsilon-\\mu B_0)}} \\Big) + \\delta f_s \\\\\n&\\approx f_{0s}\\Big( \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu B_0}{m_s}},\\sqrt{\\frac{2(\\epsilon-\\mu B_0)}{m_s}} \\Big) + \\frac{2\\mu}{m_s}\\delta B\\Big(\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\perp^2}-\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2} \\Big) + \\delta f_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus \\[\n\\delta f_s = \\delta F_s - w_\\perp^2\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\Big(\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\perp^2}-\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2} \\Big)\n\\]\nIf \\(f_{0s}\\) is a bi-Maxwellian, \\[\nf_{0s} = \\frac{n_s}{\\pi^{3/2}v_{\\text{th}\\perp s}^2 v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}}\\exp\\Big(-\\frac{w_\\perp^2}{v_{\\text{th}\\perp s}^2}-\\frac{w_\\parallel^2}{v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}^2}\\Big)\n\\] then this can be further written as \\[\n\\delta f_s = \\delta F_s + w_\\perp^2\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\Big(\\frac{1}{v_{\\text{th}\\perp s}^2} - \\frac{1}{v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}^2} \\Big) f_{0s} = \\delta F_s + w_\\perp^2\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\frac{m_sn_s}{2}\\Big(\\frac{1}{p_{\\perp s}} - \\frac{1}{p_{\\parallel s}} \\Big) f_{0s}\n\\]\nWe can eliminate the partial derivatives via integration by parts: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2} &= \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\int dw_\\perp\\int \\frac{1}{2w_\\parallel}\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel}dw_\\parallel \\\\\n&= \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\int dw_\\perp\\int\\frac{1}{2w_\\parallel}\\mathrm{d} f_{0s} \\\\\n&= \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\int dw_\\perp\\Big[\\cancel{\\frac{f_{0s}}{2w_\\parallel}\\bigg\\rvert_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}} - \\int f_{0s}\\mathrm{d}\\frac{1}{2w_\\parallel}\\Big] \\\\\n&= \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\int dw_\\perp\\int\\frac{1}{2w_\\parallel^2}f_{0s}dw_\\parallel \\\\\n&= \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w} \\frac{1}{2w_\\parallel^2}f_{0s} \\\\\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}w_\\perp w_\\perp^4\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\perp^2} &= 2\\pi\\int dw_\\parallel \\Big[ \\cancel{\\frac{1}{2}w_\\perp^4f_{0s}\\bigg\\rvert_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\int f_{0s}dw_\\perp^4 \\Big] \\\\\n&= -2\\pi\\int dw_\\parallel 2w_\\perp^2 f_{0s}w_\\perp dw_\\perp \\\\\n&= -2 \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w} w_\\perp^2 f_{0s}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis then gives us \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta p_{\\perp s} &= \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta f_s \\\\\n&= \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta F_s - \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^4}{2}\\Big(\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\perp^2}-\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2} \\Big)\\frac{\\delta B}{B} \\\\\n&= \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta F_s - \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\int dw_\\perp w_\\perp \\int \\mathrm{d} w_\\parallel \\frac{m_s w_\\perp^4}{2}\\Big(\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\perp^2}-\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2} \\Big)\\frac{\\delta B}{B} \\\\\n&= \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta F_s + 2\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta f_{0s}\\frac{\\delta B}{B} + \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{2(\\frac{1}{2}m_sw_\\perp^2)^2}{m_sw_\\parallel^2}f_{0s}\\frac{\\delta B}{B} \\\\\n&= \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_s w_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta F_s + \\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\Big( 2p_{\\perp s} - \\frac{2 p_{\\perp s}^2}{p_{\\parallel s}} \\alpha_s )\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{14.19}\\] where \\(\\alpha_s\\) is some coefficients of order 1 if \\(f_{0s}\\) is not bi-Maxwellian.\n\\(\\delta F_s\\) can be obtained by ignoring collisions and linearizing and Fourier-transforming Equation 14.12 (\\(\\mathbf{u}_s=0\\)): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i(\\omega - k_\\parallel w_\\parallel)\\delta F_s = - \\Big[ m_sw_\\parallel\\Big( \\frac{q_s}{m_s}E_\\parallel - i(\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel) \\delta u_{\\parallel s}\\Big) -i\\omega\\mu\\delta B \\Big]\\frac{\\partial F_{0s}}{\\partial \\epsilon} \\\\\n\\delta F_s = -i\\frac{w_\\parallel q_s E_\\parallel}{\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel}\\frac{\\partial F_{0s}}{\\partial \\epsilon} - \\delta u_{\\parallel s}m_sw_\\parallel\\frac{\\partial F_{0s}}{\\partial\\epsilon} - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel}\\mu\\delta B\\frac{\\partial F_{0s}}{\\partial\\epsilon}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe first term can be ignored if \\(\\beta\\gg 1\\) (??? See the complete calculation in another note!); otherwise \\(E_\\parallel\\) can be got by imposing \\(\\sum_s q_s n_s = 0\\). The second term can be shown to be equivalent to \\(\\delta u_{\\parallel s}\\partial f_{0s}/\\partial w_\\parallel\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel} &= \\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial w_\\parallel} + \\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial\\mu}\\cancel{\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial w_\\parallel}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\partial F_{0s}}{\\partial\\epsilon}m_s w_\\parallel\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] so this will not contribute to \\(\\delta p_\\perp\\) because it integrates to 0.\nThe third term can be written as \\[\n\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel}\\mu\\delta B\\frac{\\partial F_{0s}}{\\partial\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel}\\frac{m_sw_\\perp^2}{2}\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\frac{1}{w_\\parallel}\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel} m_sw_\\perp^2\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2}\n\\]\nThus, the “relevant” part of \\(\\delta F_s\\) is \\[\n\\delta F_s = -\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega-k_\\parallel w_\\parallel} m_sw_\\perp^2\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\frac{\\partial f_{0s}}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2}\n\\] and its contribution to \\(\\delta p_{\\perp s}\\) is \\[\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_sw_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta F_s = \\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}\\int\\frac{dw_\\parallel}{w_\\parallel - \\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}} \\Big[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2}\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}_\\perp \\frac{m_s^2w_\\perp^4}{2} f_{0s} \\Big]\n\\]\nHere we have \\(|k_\\parallel|\\) because if \\(k_\\parallel &lt;0\\), we can change the variable \\(w_\\parallel \\rightarrow -w_\\parallel\\). This involves the Landau integral, which can be evaluated with the residual theorem Equation 3.3 when integrate in the complex plane mostly along the real axis and the large semicircle in the upper half plane except for a small semicircle just below the pole (ADD FIGURE!): \\[\n\\frac{1}{w_\\parallel - \\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}} = P\\frac{1}{w_\\parallel - \\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}} + i\\pi\\delta\\Big(w_\\parallel - \\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|} \\Big)\n\\] so \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_sw_\\perp^2}{2}\\delta F_s &= \\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\Big[ \\cancel{\\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}P\\int\\frac{dw_\\parallel}{w_\\parallel - \\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}} \\big[ ... \\big]} + i\\pi\\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|}\\big[ ... \\big]_{w_\\parallel}=\\omega/|k_\\parallel| \\Big]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe first term is small when we assume \\(\\omega\\ll k_\\parallel v_{\\text{th}s\\parallel}\\); the second term must be kept because it is the lowest-order imaginary part which will lead to instability.\nFor a bi-Maxwellian, \\[\n\\Big[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_\\parallel^2}\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}_\\perp\\frac{m_s^2w_\\perp^4}{2}f_{0s} \\Big]_{w_\\parallel=\\omega/|k_\\parallel|} = -\\frac{2p_{\\perp s}^2}{p_{\\parallel s}}\\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\omega^2}{k_\\parallel^2 v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}^2}}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}}\n\\]\nThe exponential term is nearly 1. If it is not a bi-Maxwellian, then we need to multiply by a coefficient \\(\\alpha_s \\sim 1\\).\nEquation 14.19 becomes \\[\n\\delta p_{\\perp s} = \\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\Big[ 2p_{\\perp s} - \\frac{2p_{\\perp s}^2}{p_{\\parallel s}}\\Big( \\alpha_s + i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel|v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}}\\sigma_s \\Big) \\Big]\n\\]\nThis goes into Equation 14.18: \\[\n\\rho \\omega^2 = k_\\perp^2\\frac{B^2}{\\mu_0}\\Big[ \\sum_s(1 - \\frac{p_{\\perp s}}{p_{\\parallel s}}\\alpha_s)\\beta_{\\perp s} - i\\sum_s \\sigma_s\\frac{p_{\\perp s}}{p_{\\parallel s}}\\beta_{\\perp s}\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\omega}{|k_\\parallel| v_{\\text{th} \\parallel s}} + 1 \\Big] + k_\\parallel^2 \\frac{B^2}{\\mu_0}\\Big[ \\sum_s\\frac{\\beta_{\\perp s}}{2}\\big( 1 - \\frac{p_{\\parallel s}}{p_{\\perp s}} \\big) + 1 \\Big]\n\\]\nThe left-hand side can be neglected because \\(\\omega\\ll k_\\parallel v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}\\). The electron thermal velocity \\(v_{\\text{th}\\parallel e}\\) in the denominator can be neglected because \\(v_{\\text{th}\\parallel e} \\gg v_{\\text{th}\\parallel i}\\). The growth rate \\(\\gamma\\) is the imaginary part of \\(\\omega\\). Reorganize the last equation: \\[\n\\sigma_i\\frac{p_{\\perp i}}{p_{\\parallel i}}\\beta_{\\perp i}\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\gamma}{|k_\\parallel|v_{\\text{th}\\parallel i}} = \\sum_s \\Big(\\frac{p_\\perp s}{p_\\parallel s}\\alpha_s - 1 \\Big)\\beta_{\\perp s} - 1 -\\frac{k_\\parallel^2}{k_\\perp^2}\\Big[ \\sum_s\\frac{\\beta_{\\perp s}}{2}\\big( 1-\\frac{p_{\\parallel s}}{p_{\\perp s}}\\big) + 1 \\Big]\n\\tag{14.20}\\] where \\(\\Lambda\\equiv \\frac{k_\\parallel^2}{k_\\perp^2}\\sum_s \\Big(\\frac{p_\\perp s}{p_\\parallel s}\\alpha_s - 1 \\Big)\\beta_{\\perp s} - 1\\) triggers instability if this is positive: \\[\n\\sum_s \\Big(\\frac{p_\\perp s}{p_\\parallel s}\\alpha_s - 1 \\Big)\\beta_{\\perp s} &gt; 1\n\\]\nExamining where this comes from, we see that this amounts to \\(\\delta p_\\perp\\) modifying the magnetic pressure force and turning it from positive to negative: \\[\n\\delta p_\\perp + \\frac{B\\delta B}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{B\\delta B}{\\mu_0}\\Big[ \\underbrace{1}_{\\text{B pressure}} - \\underbrace{\\sum_s\\Big( \\frac{p_{\\perp s}}{p_{\\parallel s}}\\alpha_s - 1 \\Big)\\beta_{\\perp s}}_{\\substack{\\text{non-resonant} \\\\ \\text{particle pressure}}} + \\underbrace{...}_{\\substack{\\text{resonant particle} \\\\ \\text{pressure}}} \\Big]\n\\]\nThus, fundamentally, pressure anisotropy makes it easier to compress or rarefy magnetic field — and things become unstable when the sign of the pressure flips and it becomes energetically profitable to create compressions and rarefications.

The dispersion relation Equation 14.20 is basically a statement of pressure balance between the magnetic pressure, the non-resonant particle pressure \\(\\delta p_\\perp\\) and the resonant particle pressure \\(\\propto\\gamma\\), which came from the betatron acceleration \\(\\mu \\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}t\\) in Equation 14.12.\nThe betatron acceleration term refers to what happens in the stable case. When magnetic pressure opposes formation of \\(\\delta B\\) perturbations (say, troughs), to compensate it, we must have \\(\\gamma&lt;0\\) and energy goes from \\(\\delta B\\) to resonant particles, which are accelerated by the mirror force. The corresponding decaying of \\(\\delta B\\) is the well-known Barnes damping (landau damping of “mirror field”, Barnes 1966, also known as transit-time damping from Stix’s book. See more discussion on the physics in Southwood & Kivelson 1993.)\nTo finish the job, note that, from Equation 14.20 (ADD FIGURE!) for a given \\(k_\\perp\\) \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\gamma}{\\partial k_\\parallel}\\bigg\\rvert_{k_\\perp} \\propto \\Lambda - \\frac{k_\\parallel^2}{k_\\perp^2}\\Big[\\sum_s\\frac{\\beta_{\\perp s}}{2}\\Big(1-\\frac{p_\\parallel s}{p_\\perp s} \\Big) + 1 \\Big]\n\\]\nThe maximum growth rate is reached when the right-hand side goes to 0, which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\Lambda\\), so the maximum growth rate \\[\n\\gamma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{|k_\\parallel|v_{\\text{th}\\parallel i}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\frac{2}{3}\\Lambda \\frac{p_{\\parallel i}}{p_{\\perp i}}\\frac{1}{\\sigma_i\\beta_{\\perp i}}\n\\]\nWe have assumed \\(\\gamma\\ll k_\\parallel v_{\\text{th}\\parallel s}\\), which is indeed true if \\[\n\\Lambda\\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\perp i}} = \\big(\\sum_s A_s \\beta_{\\perp s} - 1 \\big)\\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\perp i}}\\ll 1\n\\] so our approximations are consistent.\nIf we are close to marginal instablity, \\[\n\\frac{k_\\parallel}{k_\\perp}\\sim\\sqrt{\\Lambda}\\ll 1\n\\] so mirror modes are highly oblique near the threshold.\nAnother important point is that again we encounter the UV catastrophe since \\(\\gamma\\propto k_\\parallel\\). The mirror mode is a fast, microscale instability whose peak growth rate is outside KMHD regime. Including finite larmor radius gives (Hellinger 2007 PoP 14, 082105?) \\[\n\\gamma_{\\text{peak}}\\sim\\Big(A-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\Big)^2\\beta\\Omega_i,\\quad k_{\\text{peak}}r_i\\sim\\Big( A-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\Big)\\beta\n\\]\nThus, any high-\\(\\beta\\) macroscopic solution of KMHD with \\(p_\\perp&gt;p_\\parallel\\) will blow up, just like the case for \\(p_\\parallel &gt; p_\\perp\\), and again what happens next depends on how mirror instability saturates. Note that \\(A_e\\) is ignored since \\(A_e\\ll A_i\\) (?). The mirror instability condition is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{p_{\\perp i}}{p_{\\parallel i}} - 1 &gt; \\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\perp i}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\parallel i}}\\frac{p_{\\parallel i}}{p_{\\perp i}} \\\\\n\\frac{p_{\\perp i}}{p_{\\parallel i}}\\Big( \\frac{p_{\\perp i}}{p_{\\parallel i}}-1\\Big) &gt; \\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\parallel i}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFigure 14.2 shows observation from Wind spacecraft. The solar wind indeed seems to stay within these boundaries. (ADD REFS!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: Collective solar wind observation data (\\(\\sim 1e6\\)) from Wind spacecraft.

    "text": "14.3 Origin of Pressure Anisotropy\nSo far we have seen that the bottom line is that any macroscopic, high-\\(\\beta\\) KMHD solution that has \\(p_\\perp\\neq p_\\parallel\\) (more precisely, \\(|p_\\perp - p_\\parallel|/p \\gtrsim 1/\\beta\\)) will be voilently unstable to either firehose or mirror — both of which are fast and micro-scale modes giving rise to fluctuations outside the KMHD regime (and, by the way, also outside gyrokinetics — too close to cyclotron frequency, \\(k_\\parallel/k_\\perp\\) not small enough, \\(\\delta\\mathbf{B}/B\\) also not small enough). How worried should this make us about the applicability of KMHD to high-\\(\\beta\\) plasmas that are not collisional enough to be fully fluid (i.e. \\(\\nu\\ll\\Omega_s\\))?\nThe answer is, very worried! A key property of low-frequency, weakly collisional dynamics is that the magnetic moment \\(\\mu=m_sw_\\perp^2/2B\\) is conserved by particles. The mean \\(\\mu\\) of particles of species \\(s\\) is \\[\n&lt;\\mu&gt;_w = \\frac{1}{n_s}\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\mu f_s = \\frac{p_{\\perp s}}{n_s B} = \\text{const.}\n\\]\nFor the purpose of a qualitative discussion, let us pretend for a moment that \\(n_s=\\text{const}\\) (incompressible plasmas, \\(\\beta\\gg 1\\)). Then the above conservation relation says that, locally in a fluid element (\\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is peculari velocity), every time you change \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), you must change \\(p_{\\perp s}\\) proportionally (but not \\(p_{\\parallel s}\\)). Thus we expect (?) \\[\n\\frac{1}{p_{\\perp s}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p_{\\perp s}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\sim\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}}_{\\mu\\text{ conservation}} - \\underbrace{\\nu_s\\frac{p_{\\perp s}-p_{\\parallel s}}{p_{\\perp s}}}_{\\substack{\\text{relaxation of pressure} \\\\ \\text{anisotropy by collisions}}}\n\\tag{14.21}\\]\nIt is useful to remind ourselves that \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}t\\) is in the \\(\\mathbf{u}_s\\) frame. Balancing the two effects on the right-hand side, \\[\n\\Delta_s = \\frac{p_{\\perp s} - p_{\\parallel s}}{p_{\\perp s}} \\sim\\frac{1}{\\nu_s}\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{14.22}\\]\nThis expression is valid only if \\(\\Delta_s\\ll 1\\), i.e. \\(\\nu_s\\gg \\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), otherwise \\(\\Delta_s\\) will grow with time as B is changed. Thus\n\nB increases locally \\(\\rightarrow \\Delta_s &gt;0 \\rightarrow\\) mirror\nB decreases locally \\(\\rightarrow \\Delta_s &lt;0 \\rightarrow\\) firehose\n\nAs nealy any large-scale dynamics involves local changes in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), this means that nearly any macroscopic solution of KMHD in the high-\\(\\beta\\) regime will be unstable. A very good example is the dynamo problem: when magnetic field is randomly stretched by turbulence, leading (in MHD) to exponential growth of magnetic energy (and, eventually, to saturated fields we observe), locally one find structures of this sort: (ADD FIGURE!)\nGenerally speaking, in order to understand long-time evolution, we need some sort of mean-field theory for the large-scale effect of the microscale instabilities on the dynamics. Presumably, this is to keep preserve anisotropy, marginal out (?) the instabilities (as indeed appears to be confirmed by the solar wind measurements — see Bale + 2009).\nThere are two ways in which this can happen — firehose and mirror fluctuations might scatter particles, leading to higher effective collisionality and ? control the pressure anisotropy \\[\n-\\frac{2}{\\beta}\\lesssim \\frac{p_\\perp - p_\\parallel}{p}\\lesssim \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n\\]\nThey might inhibit changes of B, which is another way of keeping \\(\\Delta\\) under control. Which of these matters for dynamics, see the speculative overview of the possible consequences of either mechanisim in MNRAS 440, 3226 (2014).\n\nnonlinear firehose: Rosin+ MNRAS 413 2011\nnonlinear mirror: Rincon+ MNRAS 447, 2015\nPIC simulations: Kunz+ PRL, 2014",

    "text": "14.4 Remarks\n\n14.4.1 Remark I\nIf we assume incompressibility, the magnetic induction Equation 14.7 becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{B}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\hat{b}\\hat{b}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen, from Equation 14.22, \\[\np_{\\perp s} - p_{\\parallel s}\\sim\\frac{p_s}{\\nu_c}\\hat{b}\\hat{b}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u}\n\\] where \\(p_s/\\nu_c\\) is the parallel dynamical viscosity. Putting this back into Equation 14.10, we get the lowest order ??? MHD equation. So, from the large-scale point of view, pressure anisotropy is viscous stress — but the resulting equations are ill-posed (blow up via instabilities with \\(\\gamma\\propto k_\\parallel\\)).\n\n\n14.4.2 Remark II\nMore rigorously, Equation 14.21 can be obtained via “CGL equations”, i.e. the evolution equations of \\(p_{\\perp s}\\) and \\(p_{\\parallel s}\\). Namely \\(\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_sw_\\perp^2}{2}\\) Equation 14.11: \\[\np_{\\perp s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\ln\\frac{p_{\\perp s}}{n_s B} = -\\nabla\\cdot(q_{\\perp s}\\hat{b}) - q_{\\perp s}\\nabla\\cdot\\hat{b} - \\nu_s(p_{\\perp s} - p_{\\parallel s})\n\\tag{14.23}\\]\n\\(\\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}m_sw_\\parallel^2\\) Equation 14.11: \\[\np_{\\parallel s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\ln\\frac{p_{\\parallel s}B^2}{n_s^3} = -\\nabla\\cdot(q_{\\parallel s}\\hat{b}) + 2q_{\\perp s}\\nabla\\cdot\\hat{b} - 2\\nu_s (p_{\\parallel s} - p_{\\perp s})\n\\tag{14.24}\\]\nThe left-hand side is the conservation of \\(J=\\oint dl w_\\parallel\\), i.e. “bounce invariant”. The new feature here is heat fluxes: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{\\perp s} = \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}\\frac{m_sw_\\perp^2}{2}w_\\parallel f_s \\\\\nq_{\\parallel s} = \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{w}m_sw_\\parallel^3 f_s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThey are here because particles can flow in and out of a fluid element and thus affect the conservation (or otherwise) of \\(&lt;\\mu&gt;_w\\) and \\(&lt;J^2&gt;_w\\) within it.\nFinally, from Equation 14.23 and Equation 14.24, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(p_{\\perp s} - p_{\\parallel s}) &= (p_{\\perp s} + 2p_{\\parallel s})\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} + (p_{\\perp s} - 3p_{\\parallel s})\\frac{1}{n_s}\\frac{dn_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\\n&-\\nabla\\cdot[(q_{\\perp s}-q_{\\parallel s})\\hat{b}] - 3q_{\\perp s}\\nabla\\cdot\\hat{b} - 3\\nu_s(p_{\\perp s} - p_{\\parallel s})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n???\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta_s &= \\frac{p_{\\perp s}-p_{\\parallel s}}{p_s} \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{1}{\\nu_s}\\Big\\{ \\frac{1}{B}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{1}{n_s}\\frac{dn_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{\\nabla\\cdot[((q_{\\perp s} - q_{\\parallel s})\\hat{b})] + 3q_{\\perp s}\\nabla\\cdot\\hat{b}}{3p_s} \\Big\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTypically, what prominent here are electron heat fluxes. So heat fluxes can also lead to anisotropies and so macroscopic solutions of KMHD involving temperature gradients will also go unstable at microscales!\nSo here we are, we cannot change B at large scales, we cannot compress/rarefy the plasma and we cannot have temperature gradients without having to deal everything exploding and needing new equations.

In the low-frequency and \\(|k\\lambda_D|^2\\ll 1\\) limit with \\(\\lambda_D\\) being the Debye length, Poisson’s equation can be approximated as the quasi-neutrality condition; \\(\\sum_j n_{0j}q_j&lt;\\delta f_j&gt;_v\\simeq 0\\). Here, \\(&lt;...&gt;_v = \\int \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} (...)\\) is the velocity-space integral, and subscript \\(j\\) runs over the particle species. Meanwhile, substituting the parallel Ampère’s law into the \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{J}\\simeq 0\\) quasi-neutrality condition as derived by Equation 15.4 yields a generalized linear gyrokinetic vorticity equation, which is often convenient to use in studying shear/kinetic Alfvén wave dynamics.\nLinear kinetic Alfvén wave properties\n(WARNING: SUPER HARD TO FOLLOW!)

Since wave-particel energy and momentum exchanges are proportional to \\(|\\delta E_\\parallel|\\), short-wavelength KAW are, thus, expected to play crucial roles in the heating, acceleration, and transport of charged particles.\nIn addition to having a significant \\(\\delta E_\\parallel\\), another important property of KAW, in contrast to SAW, is that KAW has a finite perpendicular (to \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\)) group velocity, \\(\\mathbf{v}_{g\\perp}\\). Assuming \\(|k_\\perp r_{Li}|^2\\ll 1\\), we have, letting \\(\\omega_A^2\\equiv k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2\\):\n\\[\n\\omega_\\mathbf{k}^2 \\simeq \\omega_A^2(1+k_\\perp^2 \\hat{r}^2)\n\\tag{15.15}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\hat{r}^2 = (3/4 + \\tau)r_{Li}^2\n\\tag{15.16}\\]\nThus\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{g\\perp}=\\frac{\\partial \\omega_\\mathbf{k}}{\\partial \\mathbf{k}_\\perp}\\simeq \\frac{\\omega_A^2}{\\omega_\\mathbf{k}}\\hat{r}^2\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\n\\tag{15.17}\\]\nLinear mode conversion of KAW\nEquation 15.15 has a significant implication in non-uniform plasmas. Consider, again, a slab plasma with a non-uniform \\(\\omega_A^2(x)\\) and \\(k_\\perp^2 = k_x^2(x)\\) being the WKB wavenumber in the non-uniformity \\(x\\)-direction. Equation 15.15 then indicates that KAW is propagating (\\(k_x^2&gt;0\\)) in the \\(\\omega_\\mathbf{k}^2&gt;\\omega_A^2(x)\\) region, and it is cutoff (\\(k_x^2&lt;0\\)) in the \\(\\omega_\\mathbf{k}^2&lt;\\omega_A^2(x)\\) region. That \\(\\mathbf{v}_{g\\perp}\\) is finite also suggests that, in constrast to SAW, an initial smooth perturbation will not only evolve into short wavelengths, but also propagate toward the lower \\(\\omega_A^2(x)\\) region. These features are illustrated in Figure 15.3(b); where the spatial-temporal evolution of KAW is solved explicitly according to the following wave equation: (DO IT MYSELF!!!)\n\\[\n\\Big[ \\hat{r}^2\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} - 1 - \\frac{1}{\\omega_A^2(x)}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\Big] \\delta B_y(x,t) = 0\n\\tag{15.18}\\]\nEquation 15.18 can be readily derived from Equation 15.15 by letting \\(\\omega_\\mathbf{k}=i\\partial/\\partial t\\) and \\(k_\\perp=-i\\partial/\\partial x\\). The spatial profile of \\(\\omega_A^2(x)/\\omega^2 = 1/(1+x^2/L^2)\\) is shown in Figure 15.3(a), with \\(L\\) indicating the profile length-scale, so that the KAW wave-packet frequency is assumed to be consistent with the SAW frequency at \\(x=0\\). Figure 15.3(b) shows the propagation of the KAW wave-packet in the direction of radial non-uniformity, consistent with Equation 15.17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: (a) Spatial dependence of \\(\\omega_A^2\\). (b) Propagation of the KAW wave-packet in the non-uniformity direction.\n\n\n\nThat there exists a finite perpendicular group velocity also implies, in the steady state, the removal of “singular” resonance and linear mode conversion process (Hasegawa and Chen 1976, see also Chapter 16). More specifically, the corresponding wave equation is given by:\n\\[\n\\Big[\\hat{r}^2\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\Big( \\frac{\\omega_0^2}{\\omega_A^2(x)} - 1 \\Big) \\Big]\\delta\\hat{B}_y(x) = \\delta\\hat{B}_{y0}\n\\tag{15.19}\\]\nHere, \\(\\omega_0\\) is the external driving frequency. In the ideal SAW (\\(\\hat{r}\\rightarrow 0\\)) limit, there is the resonance singularity at \\(x_0\\), where \\(\\omega_0^2 = \\omega_A^2(x_0)\\). Noting that, near \\(x=x_0\\), \\(\\omega_A^2(x)\\simeq \\omega_0^2 + (\\omega_A^2)^\\prime(x_0)(x-x_0)\\equiv \\omega_0^2 - (\\omega_0^2/L_A)(x-x_0)\\), Equation 15.19 can be approximated as an inhomogeneous Airy equation and solved analytically. Equation 15.19 can then be solved, with appropriate boundary conditions, by connecting the solutions valid away from the \\(x=x_0\\) resonance layer via the analytic solution of the inhomogeneous Airy equation valid near \\(x=x_0\\) (Hasegawa and Chen 1975, 1976). The solutions away from the singular layer are given by:\n\\[\n\\delta\\hat{B}_y(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{lr}\n\\frac{\\delta\\hat{B}_{y0}}{\\epsilon_A(x)} & \\text{for }\\omega_0^2 &lt; \\omega_A^2(x) \\\\\n\\frac{\\delta\\hat{B}_{y0}}{\\epsilon_A(x)} - \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\delta\\hat{B}_{y0}}{(\\hat{r}/L_A)^{1/2}}\\Big( \\frac{\\hat{r}^2}{\\epsilon_A(x)} \\Big)^{1/4}\\exp\\Big[ i\\int_{x_0}^x \\Big( \\frac{\\epsilon_A(x^\\prime)}{\\hat{r}^2} \\Big)^{1/2} \\mathrm{d}x^\\prime +i\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\Big] & \\text{for }\\omega_0^2 &gt; \\omega_A^2(x)\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\tag{15.20}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\epsilon_A(x) = \\frac{\\omega_0^2}{\\omega_A^2(x)} - 1\n\\]\nThe corresponding numerical solutions are plotted in Figure 15.4. (I DON’T UNDERSTAND!!!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Illustration of ideal MHD (dashed blue line) and KAW (red line) solutions, which asymptotically match Equation 15.20 for \\(|x-x_0|/\\Delta_0\\gg 1\\). The Airy swelling factor is evident from the normalization of the ordinate.\n\n\n\nBoth the analytical results and mode conversion process exhibit two important features. One is, instead of being singular, the amplitude at \\(x=x_0\\) (where \\(\\omega_A(x_0) = \\omega_0\\)) is amplified by the Airy swelling factor \\((L_A/\\hat{r})^{2/3}\\). Here, we recall \\(L_A\\) is the scale length of \\(\\omega_A\\) and \\(\\hat{r}\\), from Equation 15.16, is of \\(\\mathcal{O}(r_{Li})\\), and, hence, \\(|L_A/\\hat{r}|\\gg 1\\). The other is the singularity at \\(x=x_0\\) is being replaced by the Airy scale length \\(\\Delta_0=(\\hat{r}^2L_A)^{1/3}\\). Recalling, from Equation 10.37, \\(|k_x|\\simeq |\\omega_A^\\prime| t\\simeq (\\omega/L_A)t\\), there then exists a KAW formation time scale given by \\((\\omega_0/L_A)t_0\\simeq 1/\\Delta_0\\); i.e., \\(\\omega_0 t_0\\simeq (L_A/\\hat{r})^{2/3}\\). Taking, for an example, a typical laboratory plasma, \\(L_A/\\hat{r}\\simeq\\mathcal{O}(10^3)\\), we have \\(\\omega_0 t_0\\simeq\\mathcal{O}(10^2)\\), suggesting that it is reasonable to anticipate, in the presence of SAW continuous spectrum, the appearance of KAW in such plasmas.\nThe main mode identification method for KAWs is based on the measurement of the wave polarization, \\(|c\\delta\\mathbf{E}_\\perp/v_A\\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp|\\). Observations can be found from Van Allen Probes in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere and the Cluster satellites in the solar wind.\n\n\n15.4.2 Nonlinear Gyrokinetics\nThe idea of deriving the gyrokinetic equations is very similar to the derivation of 5/10-moment equations. Extra care is needed because of the coordinate transformation to the guiding center coordinates.

    "text": "16.1 Historial Review\nBefore 1950s, no people thought about the idea of standing waves in space simply because a vacuum had been assumed. Right after the space age began, Dungey proposed that standing Alfvén waves could be excited on geomagnetic field lines.\nNow, the big question is: where do the quantized numbers of the observed ULF waves come from [Kivelson & Southwood, 1986]?Researchers borrowed ideas from ionospheric radio propagation, laser fusion and plasma physics and came up with the names cavity and waveguide. For the box model that we will discuss in the next section, if the z boundaries are perfectly reflecting, wave fields must have standing structure in the z direction, and allowed parallel wave numbers are quantized (\\(k_z = m\\pi/c\\), as in Equation 16.19). If the boundaries are weakly absorptive, the parallel wave numbers are complex, but the real parts are still quantized as above. If we impose periodic boundary conditions in the y direction, the wavenumber in \\(y\\), \\(k_y\\), needs to be quantized as well.\nAnother question: if these discretized frequencies correspond to standing waves propagating along the field lines, at the footprints (i.e. ground measurements) the amplitudes shall be the smallest? Why are we still able to observe that on the ground?",

    "text": "Ground observations have shown discrete frequencies for EM wave power. In the magnetosphere the Alfvén speed is typically \\(\\sim 1000\\,\\text{km/s}\\), while typical periods of geomagnetic pulsations are 10-600 s. Thus typical wavelengths are \\(10^4-10^6\\,\\text{km}\\), or \\(1-100\\,\\text{R}_E\\), comparable with the size of the magnetosphere itself. So uniform plasma theory is clearly inadequate.\nIn the 1950s people realized that MHD waves of poloidal and toroidal modes can be coupled, and if we thought the modes as standing waves, we might explain the discrete frequencies. However, good agreements were not found because there were poor estimates of the magnetospheric plasma density.\nIn the 1960s, [Sugiura 1961] showed that waves are observed simultaneously at both ends of the same field line, which indicated that the waves were guided. [Nagata+ 1963] showed pulsations at conjugate points could be matched cycle for cycle. The phase comparison could indicate the possible harmonics of standing waves. [Patel 1965] reported discovery of both transverse and compressional waves in space from Explorer 12 magnetometer data that are correlated with ground measurements, confirming that they were the same. [Cummings+ 1969] showed long-lived and frequent waves with nice numerical comparison of their periods from the poloidal and toroidal mode equations.\nIn the 1970s a simpler box model was proposed to explain field line resonance. The idea of standing waves could not explain why only some field lines are preferentially excited (with the foot point of the field line near magnetic latitude \\(70^\\circ\\)). In the box model, discrete frequencies are treated as sources that reflect the properties of the magnetopause thickness with a preferred KHI growth rate.\nIn the 1980s the cavity model was proposed to link the discrete frequencies to the eigenmodes if we treated the magnetosphere as a cavity.\nIn the 1985s the waveguide model was proposed based on the cavity idea to loose the constrain in the azimuthal direction. This could explain many ground observation of discrete frequency, large amplitude Pc5 waves but satellite measurements often saw small amplitude Pc3/4 waves. Unlike field line resonances, which are described by a single eigennumber (\\(k_z\\)), cavity modes have three eigennumbers, corresponding to the number of wavelengths along a field line (\\(k_z\\)), azimuthally around the Earth (\\(k_y\\)), and radially between the magnetopause (or bow shock) and the inner reflection point (\\(n\\)). It is argued in the 1990s that if the lowest order mode has a frequency of, say, 2 mHz, then above perhaps 10 mHz the higher order modes will be so numerous and close in frequency that they could probably not be resolved in the data given their inherent width and the frequency resolution of a typical spectrum. Rather they would appear as a continuum. As a continuum, they can not be responsible for exciting discrete frequencies in this higher frequency band (corresponding to Pc3/4). Maybe the waveguide model is only relevant to Pc5 pulsations?",

    "section": "16.2 Theory",
    "text": "16.2 Theory\nThe theory starts from linearized cold MHD Equation 10.30 and Equation 10.31.\n\n16.2.1 Axisymmetric Spherical Coordinates\nFirst, let’s treat the problem in spherical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\phi)\\), as done by (Radoski and Carovillano 1966).\nThe background density is taken to be only a function of the radial distance, \\(\\rho = \\rho(r)\\). In the analysis below the perturbed variables, \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\), \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) are treated as axisymmetric, i.e. in spherical coordinates any perturbed function has the form \\[\n\\mathbf{\\delta} = \\delta_r(r,\\theta)\\hat{r} + \\delta_\\theta(r,\\theta)\\hat{\\theta} + \\delta_\\phi(r,\\theta)\\hat{\\phi}\n\\]\nUnder this symmetry, the variables can be separated into two independent sets referred to as the toroidal and poloidal variables:\n\nToroidal variables\n\n\\(B_{1\\phi}, E_r, E_\\theta, u_\\phi, j_r, j_\\theta;\\, \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial u_\\phi}{\\partial \\phi}\\equiv 0\\) (incompressible)\n\nPoloidal variables\n\n\\(B_{1r}, B_{1\\theta}, E_\\phi, u_r, u_\\theta, j_\\phi ;\\, \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial E_\\phi}{\\partial \\phi}\\equiv 0\\)\nThe name of the set were originally based on the magnetic field perturbation directions. One insight into these two sets of variables can be gained from the Poynting vector \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). The simplest MHD Ohm’s law constrains the electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) to be perpendicular to the background magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\). For the toroidal mode, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) lies in a meridional plane and \\(B_{1\\phi}\\) is out of plane, so \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is directed along the field lines. For the poloidal mode, \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is in a meridional plane and parallel to the wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\), because \\[\\mathbf{B}_1 = -i\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E}\\Rightarrow \\mathbf{S}\\parallel\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}_1 \\parallel \\mathbf{E}\\times(\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{E})=E^2\\mathbf{k} - \\cancel{(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{k})}\\mathbf{E} \\parallel \\mathbf{k}\n\\] for a transverse EM wave (\\(\\mathbf{E}\\perp\\mathbf{k}\\)). Thus the toroidal mode is an Alfvén mode with dispersion relation \\(\\omega = V_A k \\cos\\theta\\), \\(\\mathbf{S} \\parallel \\mathbf{B}_0\\), while poloidal mode is a fast mode with dispersion relation \\(\\omega = V_A k\\), \\(\\mathbf{S} \\parallel \\mathbf{k}\\).\nTo clarify my early misunderstanding: a toroidal mode is not propagating in the toroidal direction! Similarly, a poloidal mode does not propagate in the poloidal direction. In fact, it is more common to have a fast poloidal mode propagating in the azimuthal direction, then coupling to the Alfvén toroidal mode along the ambient magnetic field direction, then being observed on the ground. Table 16.1 from (Zong, Rankin, and Zhou 2017) summarizes properties of toroidal and poloidal mode standing ULF waves.\n\n\n\nTable 16.1: Properties of toroidal and poloidal mode standing ULF wave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nULF mode\nMagnetic field\nElectric field\nWave number\n\n\n\n\nToroidal waves\nB_azimuthal (\\(B_\\phi\\))\nE_radial (\\(E_r\\))\nSmall wave number m\n\n\nPoloidal waves\nB_radial (\\(B_r\\))\nE_azimuthal (\\(E_\\phi\\))\nLarge wave number m\n\n\nCompressional poloidal waves\nB_parallel (\\(B_\\parallel\\))\nE_azimuthal (\\(E_\\phi\\))\nLarge wave number m\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the axisymmetric poloidal electric field \\(E_\\phi \\sim e^{i\\omega t}\\), Equation 10.30 becomes (I HAVEN‘T DERIVED THIS!) \\[\nB_0^2[\\nabla^2 - (r^2 \\sin^2\\theta)^{-1}] E_\\phi = -\\mu_0 \\rho \\omega^2 E_\\phi\n\\]\nThis is the decoupled poloidal wave equation. For a dipole field, \\(B_0^2 = \\frac{M^2(1+3\\mu^2)}{r^6}\\), where \\(M\\) is the magnetic moment and \\(\\mu = \\cos\\theta\\) is the colatitude. A solution for \\(E_\\phi\\) is sought after a separation of the unknowns of the form \\[\nE_\\phi = \\sum_{l=1}^{\\infty} f_l(r) P_l^m(\\mu)\n\\] where \\(P_l^m\\) is the associated Legendre function with integer indices \\(l\\) and \\(m\\). Why this form you may ask? It’s a mathematical hypothesis based on experience and talents. With this representation the poloidal wave equation becomes \\[\n\\sum_{l=1}^{\\infty}[(1+3\\mu^2)O_l + 2K^2] f_l P_l^m = 0\n\\tag{16.1}\\] where \\(K^2 = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\rho}{2}\\big( \\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{M^2}\\big)^2\\) (maybe the coefficient is wrong) and \\(O_l\\) is the spherical Bessel operator \\[\nO_l = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2}r - \\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\n\\]\n(This is almost out of my control now. If I want to fully understand this, I need to go back to math equations for physics!!!) The special property of Legendre polynomials allows us to write the solution to the wave equation as \\[\n\\sum_{s = 0,\\pm 2} a_{l+s} O_{l+s} f_{l+s} + K^2 f_l = 0\n\\tag{16.2}\\] where the constants coefficients are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{l+2} &= \\frac{3(l+2)(l+3)}{2(2l+3)(2l+5)} \\\\\na_{l} &= \\frac{5l(l+1)-6}{(2l-1)(2l+3)} \\\\\na_{l-2} &= \\frac{3(l-2)(l-1)}{2(2l-3)(2l-1)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom Equation 16.2, we know that radial amplitudes of opposite parity do not couple. Since only \\(l\\ge 1\\) occurs in Equation 16.1, there are two fundamental unknown radial amplitudes: one for odd \\(l\\) and one for even \\(l\\).\nWe assume perfect reflection at the boundaries so that the transverse components of \\(E\\), i.e. \\(E_\\theta\\) and \\(E_\\phi\\), are zeros. The walls are assumed to be rigid so that \\(u_r = 0\\). The normal component of \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) also vanishes from the governing equations.\nThe toroidal wave equation seems to be too complicated for me following Radoski’s derivations…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: Cartoons showing the oscillation of a field line in the two lowest frequency toroidal modes (left) and poloidal modes (right). On the left the field line is drawn stretched out from north to south, and we look towards the Earth as the field line is displaced east and west. On the right, the dipolar field line is displaced within its meridian plane so all magnetic perturbations are radial. Note that for the toroidal mode, the magnetic perturbations (AD) have the opposite sense north and south in the fundamental and the same sense in the second harmonic. The opposite is true of the AH perturbation in the poloidal mode.\n\n\n\nFrom the boundary condition, the length \\(l\\) of the field line between two reflection point must be a multiple of half the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), implying \\[\nn\\lambda = 2l,\\quad n = 1,2,3,...\n\\]\nFrom the dispersion relation, with the average Alfvén speed \\(&lt;V_A&gt;\\), one finds: \\[\n\\omega_n = &lt;V_A&gt; k = &lt;V_A&gt;\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{n\\pi&lt;V_A&gt;}{l}\n\\]\n\n\n16.2.2 Cylindrical Coordinates\nIn cylindrical coordinates \\((r,\\phi,z)\\), assuming perturbations of the form \\(e^{i(m\\phi - \\omega t)}\\), we can separate the linearized equations ((Hughes 1994) I HAVEN’T DERIVED THIS!), \\[\n\\Big[ \\omega^2 \\mu_0 \\rho - \\frac{1}{r}(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla)r^2(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla) \\Big]\\frac{u_\\phi}{r} = \\omega m \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{r}\n\\tag{16.3}\\]\n\\[\n\\Big[\\omega^2 \\mu_0 \\rho - rB^2 (\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla)\\frac{1}{r^2 B^2}(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla) \\Big]rE_\\phi = i\\omega B^2 (\\mathbf{B}_0\\times\\nabla)_\\phi \\Big( \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1}{B^2} \\Big)\n\\tag{16.4}\\]\n\\[\ni\\omega \\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\frac{1}{r}(\\mathbf{B}\\times\\nabla)_\\phi (rE_\\phi) - imB^2\\frac{u_\\phi}{r}\n\\]\nThe first two equations are from the momentum equation. \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla\\) is the derivative along the direction of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). These are wave equations coupled by the terms on the RHS which depend on \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1\\), the compressional part of the magnetic perturbation. The third equation is from Faraday’s law and Ohm’s law. It shows how \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1\\), \\(E_\\phi\\) and \\(u_\\phi\\) are related and closes the set. Since the transverse dispersion relation depends only on \\(k_\\parallel\\), it is tempting to think of the LHS of Equation 16.3 and Equation 16.4 as representing pseudo-transverse mode oscillations, and the RHS as representing the coupling due to the fast mode which has a compressional component. When \\(m\\neq 0\\), the phase variation of the toroidal mode in the \\(\\phi\\) direction leads to a compressional perturbation in the magnetic field. The polarizations of the toroidal and poloidal oscillations are no longer orthogonal, and thus there is coupling.\nIf \\(m = 0\\) the RHS of Equation 16.3 vanishes. The LHS then describes a mode in which the electric field is purely radial and the magnetic and velocity perturbations are azimuthal. Magnetic L shells decouple and each shell oscillates azimuthally independently of each other. This is the Alfvénic toroidal mode. If \\(m\\rightarrow\\infty\\), for the RHS to remain finite, \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_1\\rightarrow0\\) so the RHS of Equation 16.4 vanishes. Equation 16.4 then describes a mode in which \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is azimuthal and \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) are contained in a meridian plane. This is the compressional poloidal mode.\n\n\n16.2.3 Cartesian Box Model\nEarliest theories had cold ideal MHD equations Equation 10.30 or Equation 10.31 expressed in the spherical or cylindrical coordinates, which are not easy to solve. As we will see, the essence of FLR can be obtained in the Cartesian coordinates. We simplify the actual dayside magnetosphere, which like a compressed dipole, to something we can solve analytically. Imagine a field line with both footpoints connecting to the conducting ionosphere, we can map this curved field line into a straight line extending along \\(z\\). In the \\(x\\)-direction, the outer boundary is the magnetopause, and the inner boundary is the reflection point (plasmapause or ionosphere). The \\(y\\)-direction represents the azimuthal direction, therefore at the front of the magnetosphere it is more aligned with the \\(y\\)-direction in GSE/GSM and at the flanks/sides it is more aligned with the \\(x\\)-direction. If the length in \\(y\\) is finite (\\(b &lt; \\infty\\)), we call it a cavity; if the length in \\(y\\) is infinite (\\(b\\rightarrow \\infty\\)), we call it a waveguide. The names cavity and waveguide are inherited from electrodynamics. This is shown in the schematic Figure 16.2 and Figure 16.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.2: From one of Southwood & Kivelson’s paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.3: From one of Southwood & Kivelson’s paper.\n\n\n\nAlong the \\(z\\)-direction, we impose the ionospheric boundary for closed field lines \\(u_x = u_y = B_{1z} = 0\\). Because of the ideal MHD assumption, the electric field along the field lines \\(E_z = 0\\). In the \\(y\\)-direction, we impose either a periodic boundary condition for the cavity model that leads to a quantized wavenumber \\(k_y\\), or a infinite boundary. In the \\(x\\) direction, the boundaries are provided by large \\(V_A\\) gradients at both the outer boundary \\(x_m\\) (magnetopause) and the inner boundary \\(x_t\\) (plasmapause). We impose a reflective boundary \\(u_x = 0\\) at \\(x = x_t, x_m\\). The inhomogeity in \\(x\\) means that we can only consider Fourier components in the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) directions. Therefore, we seek wave modes of the form \\(\\propto \\exp[i(k_y y + k_z z - \\omega t)]\\) with the ansatz\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k} &= (0, k_y, k_z) \\\\\n\\mathbf{E} &= (E_x(x), E_y(x), 0) e^{i(k_y y + k_z z - \\omega t)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_1 &= (B_{1x}, B_{1y}, B_{1z}) e^{i(k_y y + k_z z - \\omega t)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_0 &= B_z \\hat{z} = B\\hat{z} \\\\\n\\rho &= \\rho(x) \\\\\n\\mathbf{u} &= \\mathbf{u}_0 + \\mathbf{u}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe linearized momentum Equation 10.29 gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho\\Big(\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\cancel{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u}}\\Big) &= \\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n\\rho\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSeparating the two perpendicular \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions and applying plane wave decomposition,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i\\omega\\rho\\mu_0 u_x &= (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1)_y B_z - (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1)_z \\cancel{B_y} \\\\\n&= \\Big(\\frac{\\partial B_{1x}}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial x}\\Big) B \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big( B B_{1z} \\Big) + i k_z B B_{1x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i\\omega\\rho\\mu_0 u_y &= (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1)_z \\cancel{B_x} - (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1)_x B_z \\\\\n&= \\Big(\\frac{\\partial B_{1y}}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial y}\\Big) B \\\\\n&= k_z B B_{1y} - k_y B B_{1z}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom the simplest form of the generalized Ohm’s law \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{u}_1 \\times\\mathbf{B}_0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE_x &= - u_y B \\\\\nE_y &= - u_x B\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInserting into the linearized momentum equation, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i \\omega \\rho \\mu_0 \\frac{E_y}{B} &= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big( B B_{1z} \\Big) + i k_z B B_{1x} \\\\\n\\omega \\rho \\mu_0 \\frac{E_x}{B} &= - k_y B B_{1z} + k_z B B_{1y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{16.5}\\]\nFrom linearized Faraday’s law \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = -\\dot{\\mathbf{B}_1}\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} &= -\\dot{B_{1x}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} &= -\\dot{B_{1y}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y} &= -\\dot{B_{1z}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_{1x} &= \\frac{1}{\\omega}(- k_z E_y) \\\\\nB_{1y} &= \\frac{1}{\\omega}(k_z E_x) \\\\\nB_{1z} &= \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\Big(-i\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - k_y E_x\\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{16.6}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 16.6 into Equation 16.5 gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i \\omega \\rho \\mu_0 \\frac{E_y}{B} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Big[ B  \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\Big(-i\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - k_y E_x\\Big) \\Big] + i k_z B \\frac{-k_z}{\\omega} E_y \\\\\n-i \\big( \\omega^2 \\rho \\mu_0 / B^2 - k_z^2 \\big)E_y = k_y \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} - i \\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial x^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i \\omega \\rho \\mu_0 \\frac{E_x}{B} = k_z B \\frac{k_z}{\\omega} E_x - k_y B \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\Big(-i\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - k_y E_x\\Big) \\\\\n\\big( \\omega^2 \\rho \\mu_0 / B^2 - k_y^2 - k_z^2 \\big)E_x + i k_y\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet \\(R^2 = \\mu_0 \\rho(x) \\omega^2 / B^2 = \\omega^2/V_A(x)^2\\), we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i (R^2 - k_z^2)E_y = k_y \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} - i \\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial x^2} \\\\\n(R^2 - k_y^2 -k_z^2)E_x + i k_y\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{16.7}\\]\nEliminating \\(E_x\\) from Equation 16.7 gives\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}E_y - k_y^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}R^2(x)\\frac{1}{(R^2 - k_z^2)(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2)}\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} + (R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2)E_y = 0\n\\tag{16.8}\\]\nThere is a very important observation about polarization from Equation 16.7: \\[\n\\frac{E_x}{E_y} = -\\frac{ik_y}{R^2-k_y^2-k_z^2}\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x}\\frac{1}{E_y}\n\\tag{16.9}\\]\nOur familiar fast MHD wave is no longer linearly polarized in a nonuniform plasma! A key thing on the RHS is the dependence on the sign of \\(k_y\\) as well as \\(\\partial E_y/\\partial x\\). For fast waves propagating in opposite directions (i.e. eastward and westward in the azimuthal direction), the sense of polarization (RH, LH) will change as \\(k_y\\) changes sign across local noon. Right at the resonance point where \\(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 = 0\\), we get linearly polarized Alfvén wave. \\(\\partial E_y/\\partial x\\) changes sign across the resonance point, thus we also have another change in polarization detected on the ground for different L-shells (or magnetic latitudes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: The variation of amplitude and the sense of polarization of Pc5’s seen at high latitudes with latitude and magnetic local time. (After [Samson +, 1974].)\n\n\n\nEquation 16.8 can also be written as a second order differential equation of \\(B_{1z}\\), the compressional component of the magnetic field (see Equation 3.9), as (Kivelson and Southwood 1985) did in proposing the idea of cavity modes: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{ \\frac{\\partial R^2}{\\partial x}}{R^2 - k_z^2}\\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial x} + ( R^2 - k_y^2 - k_z^2 ) B_{1z} = 0\n\\] or equivalently, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\omega^2 \\partial V_A^{-2}/\\partial x}{\\omega^2/V_A^2 - k_z^2}\\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial x} + \\Big( \\frac{\\omega^2}{V_A^2} - k_y^2 - k_z^2 \\Big) B_{1z} = 0\n\\tag{16.10}\\]\nLet us first get some intuitions about Equation 16.8 (following (Glassmeier et al. 1999), but note that there are sign errors and wrong equations in the original paper!). This equation exhibits strong singularities found in the denominator of its second term, much as first described by Tamao (1965). The following solutions are possible. If \\(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 &gt; 0\\), from which \\(R^2 - k_z^2 &gt; 0\\) follows, no singularities appear. Assuming \\(k_y \\approx 0\\), the above equation reduces to \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}E_y + (R^2 - k_z^2)E_y = 0\n\\]\nFor a linear density profile, i.e. \\(R^2 = \\alpha_0^2 + \\alpha^2 x\\), with the definition of the turning point \\(x_t\\) via \\(R^2 = k_z^2\\), and the transformation \\(s = \\alpha^{2/3}(x-x_t)&gt;0\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial(\\alpha^{-2/3}s+x_t)} = \\alpha^{2/3}\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial s} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial x^2} &=  \\alpha^{4/3}\\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial s^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial s^2} + sE_y = 0\n\\]\nThis is the Airy or Stokes equation (Section 3.11.1) with the two principal solutions displayed in ?fig-airy-flr. The solution \\(Bi(s)\\) is unphysical as it implies unlimited growth of \\(E_y\\) behind the turning point at \\(s=0\\). Thus \\(E_y(s) = Ai(s)\\) is the required solution. The turning point actually is the point of total reflection of the wave field. Its appearance can be understood on the following grounds. The “effective” local wavenumber in \\(x\\) is given by \\[\nk_x^2(x, \\omega) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{V_A^2(x)} - k_y^2 - k_z^2\n\\tag{16.11}\\]\nIf \\(V_A^2\\) increases with \\(x\\), that is with \\(s\\) in the Airy function plot, \\(k_x^2\\) has to decrease as \\(\\omega, k_y\\) and \\(k_z\\) stay constant. Eventually \\(k_x^2\\) may become negative, which implies an imaginary wave number \\(k_x\\). At this turning point the wave will be reflected.\nKeyNotes.plot_airy_minus_x()\nNext if \\(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 &lt; 0\\), \\(R^2 - k_z^2 = 0\\) may occur. Assuming again a linear density profile, defining a resonance point \\(x_r\\) via \\(R^2 = k_z^2\\), and \\(s = x-x_r\\), the electric field perturbation transforms close to the resonance point \\(x - x_r = 0\\) into \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial s^2} - \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{s_t}{s-s_t}\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial s} + \\alpha^2(s-s_t) E_y = 0\n\\tag{16.12}\\] where \\(s_t = k_y^2/\\alpha^2\\).\nAt the resonance point its solution exhibits a clear singularity with unlimited growth of \\(E_y\\). In front of the turning point \\(s&gt;s_t\\) the solution is similar to an Airy function, while behind it singular behaviour is observed at the resonance point \\(s=0\\). I do not show the solution BECAUSE I DON’T KNOW HOW TO WRITE IT DOWN! But let us now follow (Kivelson and Southwood 1985) and check the equivalent perturbation Equation 16.10 for \\(B_{1z}\\).\nWhen we also assume linear mass density variation with \\(x\\) in Equation 16.10 such that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR^2 - k_z^2 &= \\alpha^2(x - x_r) \\\\\nR^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 &= \\alpha^2(x-x_t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(x_r = k_z^2/\\alpha^2\\), \\(x_t = (k_z^2 + k_y^2)/\\alpha^2 = x_r + k_y^2/\\alpha^2\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{x-x_r}\\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial x} + \\alpha^2(x-x_t)B_{1z} = 0\n\\tag{16.13}\\]\nThe solution of Equation 16.13 is discussed by (1986). The singular point where \\(x=x_r\\) and \\(R^2=k_z^2\\) corresponds to the resonance point where the wave frequency matches the Alfvén mode frequency. The point where \\(x=x_t\\) and \\(R^2=k_y^2 + k_z^2\\) is the turning point of the equation. When \\(x&gt;x_t\\), any wave described by the equation oscillates with \\(x\\); when \\(x&lt;x_t\\) independent solutions grow or evanesce with \\(x\\) on each side of the resonance singularity \\(x_r\\).\nSeries solutions valid in the neighborhood of \\(x=x_r\\) and \\(x=x_t\\) have been derived by a variety of authors. The Frobenius method of solution of partial differential equations can be used to find solutions valid near \\(x_r\\), where the analytic solution is of the form \\[\nR_t(x) = k_y^2(x-x_r)^2 + \\mathcal{O}[(x-x_r)^4]\n\\tag{16.14}\\] and the singular solution is of the form \\[\ns_t(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}R_t(x)\\ln(x_r - x) + \\mathcal{O}[(x-x_r)^2]\n\\tag{16.15}\\]\nFor \\(k_y^2=\\alpha^{4/3}\\), the two solutions for \\(B_{1z}\\) is shown in Figure 16.5. On the far right side of the plot the functions are close to spatial quadrature and have zeros whose spacing decreases with increasing \\(x\\). In this regime, as we will mention later, the WKB approximation is good and the amplitude and phase are proportional to \\(s^{1/4}\\) and \\(s^{3/2}\\), respectively. The amplitudes have been plotted just such that an incoming wave from large \\(x\\) would be represented by \\(R_t(x)+iS_t(x)\\) if a time variation \\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\) is specified. The corresponding mode propagating toward large \\(x\\) would be \\(R_t(x)-iS_t(x)\\). Thus \\(R_t(x), S_t(x)\\) represent standing wave forms. However, the presence of the resonance (at the far left of the plots) preludes there being perfect reflection or perfect standing wave solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.5: Two independent solutions of Equation 16.13 for \\(x &gt; x_r\\). The particular pair illustrated are solutions for the case \\(\\lambda^2/\\alpha^{4/3}=1\\) for which \\(x_t/x_r = 2\\). The dashed curve is the solution that is analytic at the singular point (cf. Equation 16.14). The solution plotted as a solid curve is finite at the singularity with infinite derivatives as evident from Equation 16.15. Amplitudes have been selected to match at large \\(x\\) where the oscillating solutions are in spatial quadrature.\n\n\n\n@sco KeyNotes.plot_b1z_ode()\nThe following physical interpretation is tempting. The MHD wave propagating into the magnetosphere is a fast mode wave generated by, e.g. plasma instabilities at the magnetopause. Eventually the wave reaches the turning point where reflection occurs. If conditions are favourable, that is if a resonance point occurs, part of the fast mode wave energy can tunnel into the resonance, where coupling from the fast mode disturbance into an Alfvén mode perturbation takes place. The resonance point always lies beyond the turning point, but energy tunnels to the resonance point and the reflection is found to be less than perfect. This scenario is schematically shown in Figure 16.6, where the reflection or turning point is assumed to coincide with the magnetopause. The point of maximum coupling or “resonant mode coupling” is given by \\(\\omega = k_\\parallel V_A(x)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is the fast mode wave frequency, \\(k_\\parallel\\) is the field-aligned component of the fast mode wave vector and \\(V_A(x)\\) is the local Alfvén velocity. This is also the Alfvén dispersion relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.6: Schematic view of the field line resonance, driven by unstable surface wave.\n\n\n\nEquation 16.10 has a long history that appeared first in the context of a radio wave obliquely incident on a region of increasing electron density, all the way back to 1951, as mentioned in (Kivelson and Southwood 1986). It also appears in calculating the absorption of laser energy by a plasma and heating a plasma by radio wave injection to excite internal Alfvén waves. Energy is absorbed at the location in the plasma corresponding to the singular point of the governing differential ?eq-flr-wave-bz or its equivalent. Without the introduction of additional effects such as dissipation or dispersion near resonance, the singularity in the differential equation implies that the amplitude of the Alfvén wave grows secularly.\nSome studies (e.g. Wright (1994)) prefer to use plasma displacement \\(\\pmb{\\xi}\\) instead of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{u} = \\dot{\\pmb{\\xi}}\\), and perturbed magnetic field component \\(B_{1z}\\) to describe the model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{V_A^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi_x}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{\\partial \\xi_x}{\\partial z^2} &= -\\frac{1}{B_0}\\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{V_A^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi_y}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{\\partial \\xi_y}{\\partial z^2} &= -\\frac{1}{B_0}\\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial y} \\\\\nB_{1z} &= - B_0 \\Big( \\frac{\\partial \\xi_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\xi_y}{\\partial y} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{16.16}\\]\nThis equation set is equivalent to Equation 10.31. The first two equations are the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) component of the momentum equation, and the last equation is the magnetic field advection equation (Faraday’s law + Ohm’s law). Recall that \\(B_{1z}\\) is the compressional perturbation to the ambient magnetic field, and \\(\\xi_y\\) corresponds to \\(u_y\\) which is the toroidal Alfvénic perturbation. Then on the RHS of the second equation, it is the azimuthal gradient in the fast mode \\(\\partial B_{1z}/\\partial y\\) that drives the response in the azimuthal place displacement \\(\\xi_y\\); the LHS is a simple harmonic oscillator and the RHS is the forcing term. Since we are seeking for solutions of the form \\(e^{i(k_y y + k_z z - \\omega t)}\\), we can see that:\n\nif \\(k_y=0\\) for the fast mode, then there are no azimuthal gradients to drive FLRs and hence you get no wave coupling;\nif \\(k_y \\rightarrow \\infty\\), then \\(\\xi_y \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(\\xi_x\\) describes a decoupled poloidal Alfvén wave.\nif \\(k_y \\neq 0\\) or \\(\\infty\\), the wave modes are coupled together and energy initially in the fast mode may mode convert to Alfvén wave energy on localized field lines.\n\nUniform density and background magnetic field\nLet \\(\\rho = \\text{const.}\\), \\(V_A = \\text{const.}\\). From Equation 16.16, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{B_{1z}} &= - B_0 \\Big( \\frac{\\partial \\ddot{\\xi_x}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\ddot{\\xi_y}}{\\partial y} \\Big) = V_A^2 \\Big( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\Big) B_{1z} \\\\ &= V_A^2 \\nabla^2 B_{1z}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConsider normal modes of waveguides of the form \\(e^{\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - i\\omega t}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)\\). The dispersion relation for the fast mode is then \\[\n\\omega^2 = V_A^2 (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)\n\\tag{16.17}\\]\nIn an infinite medium this relation gives nondispersive propagation. Since we are interested primarily in propagation along the waveguide (i.e., in the \\(y\\) direction) we shall define \\(v_p\\) and \\(v_g\\) to be the phase and group velocities along \\(\\hat{y}\\). Employing Equation 16.17 gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_p &= \\frac{\\omega}{k_y} = \\frac{k}{k_y}V_A \\\\\nv_g &= \\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial k_y} = \\frac{k_y}{k}V_A\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which yields the familiar waveguide relation \\[\nv_p v_g = V_A^2\n\\tag{16.18}\\]\nThe shear Alfvén wave has the same velocity parallel to the field line (because it is cold). However, in a waveguide the boundary conditions in the \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) directions restrict the choice of wavenumbers and introduce dispersion. Suppose that the boundaries in \\(x\\) are perfectly reflecting (e.g. \\(\\xi_x = \\frac{\\partial B_{1z}}{\\partial y} = 0\\)) as are those in \\(z\\) (\\(\\xi_x = \\xi_y = B_{1z} = 0\\)) which represent the ionospheric boundary for closed field lines. Then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nk_x &= \\pm n \\pi / a,\\, &n = 1,2,3... \\\\\nk_z &= \\pm m \\pi / c,\\, &m = 1,2,3...\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{16.19}\\] where \\(a\\) is the box length in x and \\(c\\) is the box length in z (i.e. length of the field lines).\nGiven values of \\(k_x\\) and \\(k_z\\), we may use Equation 16.17 to find \\(k_y\\) as a function of \\(\\omega\\), \\[\nk_y^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{V_A^2} - k_x^2 - k_y^2\n\\]\nIf \\(k_y\\) is real then the mode may propagate along the guide. However, if we believe that the boundary at \\(x = x_m = a\\) is not a reflector but is driven, it would be appropriate to impose a wavenumber \\(k_y\\) along the outer boundary and solve for \\(k_x\\) given \\(k_z\\). This is the case when the magnetopause is driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (i.e. \\(k_y\\) given by the surface waves), which was proposed in the 1970s to be the driver of field line resonances. In this situation \\(k_x\\) is found to be imaginary, and the mode is evanescent (exponentially decaying) in \\(x\\).\nNonuniform density and magnetic field\nThe simplest assumptions in this case would be \\(\\rho = \\rho(x)\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\\hat{z}\\), and that the Alfvén speed \\(V_A\\) is monotonically decreasing with \\(x\\), \\(\\partial V_A / \\partial x &lt; 0\\). Then again we get Equation 16.10. Solving this equation for given boundary conditions in \\(x\\) yields a set of orthogonal eigenfunctions \\(B_{1z}(x)\\) and eigenfrequencies.\nFirst of all, we shall notice that a singularity/resonance occurs at \\(x_r\\) where \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_z^2 V_A^2(x_r)\n\\tag{16.20}\\]\nAcross \\(x_r\\) there will be a \\(180^\\circ\\) phase shift for the perturbed terms (Equation 16.9). Energy is been absorbed at the resonance point from fast mode to Alfvén mode. Dissipation is required, otherwise the amplitude of the Alfvén wave grows secularly. Ionospheric dissipation near the resonant field line is likely to be one important process limiting the growth of the resonance amplitude.\nSecondly, there is a turning point at \\(x_t\\) defined via \\(k_x^2 = 0\\) (fixed \\(k_y, k_z, \\omega\\)): \\[\n\\omega^2 = (k_y^2 + k_z^2)V_A^2(x_t)\n\\tag{16.21}\\]\nOn the right of \\(x_t\\), the positive exponent represents a wave propagating in the positive \\(x\\) direction towards the magnetopause, and the negative exponent represents one propagating away from the magnetopause. This is like an imperfect standing wave solution. Across \\(x_t\\) on the left, the oscillating solutions convert to a decaying solution and an exponentially growing solution (Section 3.11.1).\nIf the Alfvén speed \\(V_A\\) is monotonically decreasing with \\(x\\), from Equation 16.20 and Equation 16.21 we always have \\(0 &lt; x_r &lt; x_t &lt; x_m\\). In the low Alfvén speed region \\([x_t, x_m]\\) the fast mode may propagate, while in the high Alfvén speed region \\([0, x_t]\\) the fast mode is evanescent. Thus the resonant singularity \\(x_r\\) is in the evanescent tail of the fast mode.\nThe first-order derivative term in Equation 16.10 dominate near \\(x=x_r\\), but is small in the propagating interval \\([x_t, x_m]\\). This is particularly true in the WKB limit (Section 3.11), where we consider waves of short wavelength in \\(x\\); i.e. second-order derivative term is much larger than the first-order derivative term. In the lowest order WKB analysis we may neglect the first-order derivatives and solve \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\\partial x^2} + \\Big( \\frac{\\omega^2}{V_A^2} - k_y^2 - k_z^2 \\Big) B_{1z} = 0\n\\tag{16.22}\\] and the WKB solution is given in the form \\[\nB_{1z}(x) = A k_x^{-1/2} e^{i\\int k_x dx} + B k_x^{-1/2}e^{-i\\int k_x dx}\n\\] where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants, and \\(k_x\\) is the “effective” wavenumber defined in Equation 16.11, an explicit function of \\(x\\).\nThe Bohr-Sommerfeld (or phase integral, Section 3.11.4) condition which the quasi-standing wave must satisfy between \\(x_t\\) and \\(x_m\\) is \\[\n\\int_{x_t}^{x_m} k_x(x,\\omega_n) dx = (n+\\alpha)\\pi\\qquad n = 1,2,3...\n\\tag{16.23}\\] where \\(x_m = a\\) is the location of the outer boundary in \\(x\\) and the phase factor \\(\\alpha\\) is determined by the boundary conditions in \\(x\\). For a perfect reflector at \\(a\\) (\\(\\xi_x=0\\)) and evanescent decay at small x, we find \\(\\alpha = -1/4\\). If there is a resonance in the waveguide, it will modify \\(\\alpha\\); however, since the resonance is in the evanescent tail there will be no leading order change in \\(\\alpha\\).\nEquation 16.23 is an integral relation for the eigenfrequencies of the fast mode: we specify \\(k_y\\), \\(k_z\\), and \\(n\\) (the mode number in x), then find the n-th eigenfrequency \\(\\omega_n\\) as that frequency for which the criterion is met. Once we compute \\(\\omega_n\\), we can then compute the locations of the excited field line \\(x_r\\) from Equation 16.20. These are the most observable discrete modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.7: From Wright 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.8: From (Samson et al. 1992).\n\n\n\nDriven FLR vs Cavity Modes vs Waveguide Modes\nThe surface wave driven FLR seems reasonable. However, the biggest problem for this hypothesis to be valid is that the mapped phase speeds to the magnetopause were too high compared to in-situ measurements. In addition, in spite of numerous magnetopause crossings by ISEE 1 and 2, regular oscillations of the magnetopause corresponding to the Kelvin-Helmholtz waves were not seen. These two facts indicated that we should seek for a new explanation for the driver.\nIn the 1980s, cavity modes and waveguide modes were proposed to remove the constraint on driven FLR. The analogy of a magnetosphere to a cavity came before the analogy to a waveguide. In a cavity model the azimuthal direction \\(\\phi\\) or the \\(y\\) direction in the box geometry is finite, and the wavenumber \\(k_y\\) is determined by the given scale size \\(b\\). In the axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates \\((r,\\phi,z)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the azimuthal angle and \\(z\\) is the coordinate along the field lines, the field has the form \\(\\sim e^{im\\phi},\\, m=0,1,2\\). This is a weak point of the theory because the magnetosphere is far from axisymmetric and there are no other obvious boundaries to define the cavity. If the system is similar to a waveguide, then \\(k_y\\) can have a continuum of values, and the waveguide allows propagation over a wide band of frequencies.\nIf instead we use a waveguide model, the azimuthal direction (or \\(y\\)-direction) will have no imposed boundary condition. Theoretically a continuum of wave modes \\(k_y\\) can excite FLR, and the discrete resonance frequencies are determined by the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition Equation 16.23 where harmonics of toroidal and poloidal are given by \\(k_z\\). The discrete frequency spectrum of the fast waveguide modes is suitable for driving a series of Alfvén resonance; however, it is not obvious that the continuous frequency spectrum of the modes will be able to drive resonances at discrete frequencies. A key observation to make waveguide mode more valid is that only small \\(k_y\\) contributes to the resonance. ((Walker et al. 1992),[Wright 1992], (Wright 1994)). If \\(k_y\\) is not fixed (but \\(k_z\\) is fixed), then Equation 16.23 is the dispersion relation for the waveguide expressing \\(\\omega\\) as a function of \\(k_y\\). The Alfvén speed is a strong function of the L shell, typically \\(\\sim L^{-3}\\). Thus, if the turning point \\(x_t\\) is reasonably deep within the magnetosphere, the range over which \\(\\omega^2/V_A^2 \\gg k_y^2 + k_z^2\\) contributes most significantly to the integral Equation 16.23. The result is that over a wide range of wavelengths the frequency is very insensitive to \\(k_y\\). Only when \\(k_y\\) is quite large this is not true, and then the turning point is near the magnetopause, and the wave does not penetrate very deeply into the magnetosphere. Each waveguide mode has a phase velocity \\(\\omega/k_y\\) and a group velocity \\(\\mathrm{d}\\omega/dk_y\\). Since Equation 16.23 defines \\(\\omega\\) as a function of \\(k_y\\), we can substitute Equation 16.11 into Equation 16.23 and differentiate with respect to \\(k_y\\) (assuming \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_y}\\int_{x_t}^{x_m}\\Big(\\frac{\\omega^2}{V_A(x)^2}-k_y^2 - k_z^2\\Big)^{1/2}dx = 0 \\\\\n\\int_{x_t}^{x_m}\\frac{1}{2}k_x^{-1}\\Big( \\frac{1}{V_A^2}\\frac{\\partial \\omega^2}{\\partial k_y} - 2k_y \\Big)dx = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\omega}{k_y}\\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial k_y}\\int_{x_t}^{x_m}k_x^{-1}V_A^{-2}dx = \\int_{x_t}^{x_m} k_x^{-1}dx\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\nv_p v_g \\equiv \\frac{\\omega}{k_y}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{dk_y} = \\frac{\\int_{x_t}^{x_m}k_x^{-1}dx}{\\int_{x_t}^{x_m}V_A^{-2}k_x^{-1}dx}\n\\]\nThe RHS is the reciprocal of the weighted mean of \\(V_A^{-2}\\) with weighting function \\(k_x^{-1}\\). Thus we can write \\[\nv_p v_g = \\left&lt;V_A^{-2}\\right&gt;^{-1}\n\\tag{16.24}\\]\nIn a uniform waveguide filled with plasma for which the Alfvén speed was \\(V_A\\) the well-known waveguide relation Equation 16.18 would be recovered. In this more complicated case where the Alfvén speed is not constant throughout the waveguide the RHS of Equation 16.24 is an appropriately weight mean of \\(V_A^{-2}\\). In general the phase velocity \\(v_p\\) is much larger than the mean Alfvén velocity in the guide, and the group velocity \\(v_g\\) is much smaller. This is also consistent with the weak dependence of \\(\\omega\\) on \\(k_y\\) such that \\(v_g\\) is small. The consequence is that even if the ends of the guide are open, the time taken for energy to be propagated along it is long compared with the period of the oscillations.\nTherefore, the waveguide model proposes the following explanation. Disturbances in the solar wind move along the magnetopause, producing a disturbance on the boundary which is propagated tailward with speed \\(v_w\\). Generally \\(v_w \\gg V_A\\). Such a disturbance is likely to excite waveguide modes with phase velocities equal to \\(v_w\\). Because the frequency of the modes is very insensitive to \\(k_y\\), the same frequencies (determined by eigenmodes in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\)) are excited no matter what the velocity. The disturbance moving with the wave can feed energy continuously into it. This then requires \\[\nk_y = \\frac{\\omega}{v_w}\n\\] i.e., the azimuthal wavenumber is determined by the velocity of the source rather than by a boundary condition on \\(y\\). Thus we have a discrete value of wavenumber and a discrete fast mode frequency spectrum, without relying on the resonance modes from the cavity model.\nSuch a disturbance could arise from more than one type of source. If it arose from an impulse in the solar wind, then one would expect the waveguide response to be a ringing at the natural frequencies of its modes with growth on the time scale required to establish the mode and decay on the time scale for leakage to the resonance and loss in the ionosphere or elsewhere. Alternatively the waveguide modes could be excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In this case it could be expected that the waveguide modes would all be excited continuously and would be driven so long as the solar wind velocity and the characteristics of the magnetopause were maintained.",

    "section": "16.3 Energy Consideration",
    "text": "16.3 Energy Consideration\n???\nThe energy that is carried into the magnetosphere across the background field by the non-guided fast mode is accumulated in the plane of resonant mode coupling (i.e. the y–z plane through \\(x_r\\) in Figure 16.3) in the form of the guided Alfvén wave. It is this localized accumulation of energy due to resonant mode coupling between a non-guided mode and a guided mode that constitutes a field line resonance. This wave energy accumulation can be described by \\[\n\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{S} = -h\n\\] where \\(w\\) is the wave energy density, \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is the Poynting flux, and \\(h\\) a dissipation term, describing energy loss due to e.g. ionospheric Joule heating. As the background parameters only vary in the radial direction, this equation reduces to \\[\n\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r}S_x - h\n\\]\nIntegration across the width of the coupling region in a radial direction leads to the following rate equation: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t} = c_e S_{ng} - S_h^{\\text{off}} - H\n\\] where \\(W\\) is the energy per area that is being accumulated in the coupling, \\(c_e\\) is a coupling efficiency, \\(S_{ng}\\) the incoming Poynting flux of the non-guided mode, and \\(S_g^{\\text{off}}\\) the “off-angle” component of the Poynting flux of that mode to which the non-guided mode couples. Including this term \\(S_g^{\\text{off}}\\) allows us to consider energy losses due to coupling to not strictly guided modes. A finite off-angle component of the coupled wave mode would render the energy accumulation less efficient or may even inhibit the build-up of a resonance. Off-angle components may arise if the transverse scale of the coupled wave become small enough for finite ion gyroradius or finite electron inertia becoming important. In this case the coupled mode is a kinetic Alfvén mode. The parameter \\(c_e\\) denotes the coupling efficiency, that is the fraction of energy of the non-guided mode that is converted into the guided mode. Finally, \\(H\\) gives the dissipative losses, integrated in the \\(x\\) direction.\nIt is now instructive to evaluate the rate Equation for the ideal MHD regime. As the Alfvén mode is a strictly guided mode its Poynting flux is directed exactly parallel to the background magnetic field. In other words, \\(S_h^{\\text{off}}=0\\), and Equation reads \\[\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t} = c_e S_{\\text{fast}}\n\\] where \\(S_{\\text{fast}} = S_{ng}\\) is the Poynting flux of the non-guided MHD mode. Thus, the energy density in the coupling region is continuously increasing as there is no outward transport of energy to balance the incoming Poynting flux of the fast mode. However, ionospheric Joule heating provides a significant dissipation mechanism with H limiting the energy density.\nResonant mode coupling is only a necessary condition for field line resonances to occur. A sufficient condition is critical coupling to a strictly guided mode and absence of dissipation to a degree that there is enough energy for resonance.",

    "section": "16.4 Non-MHD Effects",
    "text": "16.4 Non-MHD Effects\nAs been shown in previous sections, some features of the wave absorption can be simply understood using a cold fluid approach. In the cold plasma description, the Alfvén resonance is a singularity of the compressional wave Equation 16.10. The compressional wave equation may be solved by analytic continuation around the Alfvén resonance singularity in which case there is a loss of Poynting flux at the resonance and wave energy is converted to an Alfvén wave. Alternatively, a kinetic description of the mode conversion process involves two propagating modes, i.e. the compressional wave and the dispersive kinetic Alfvén wave, which couple near the resonance location with energy converted from the former to the latter. If we then consider a hot plasma, as the temperature increases the Doppler shift will spread the resonance leading to a more extended coupling region. Thus the inclusion of finite-temperature and \\(E_\\parallel\\) (in KAWs) can remove the singularity in the cold fluid model, and the energy absored by the Alfvén resonance shows up as electron heating near the resonance.\nAs a recap, in a plasma with a 1‐D inhomogeneity in the background plasma parameters along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, the linearized MHD equations can be expressed in terms of \\(\\delta p_1 = B_0\\delta B_\\parallel + \\delta p\\) and \\(\\delta B_\\perp\\) by a coupled system of equations \\[\n-i k_\\parallel\\left( 1-\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c_s^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) \\delta p_1 = \\left( 1+\\frac{c_s^2}{v_A^2}-\\frac{k_\\parallel^2 c_s^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) B_0^2 \\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\\left( \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\perp}{B_0} \\right)\n\\tag{16.25}\\] and \\[\n\\left( \\omega^2 - k_\\parallel^2 V_A^2 \\right) B_0 \\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp = ik_\\parallel v_A^2 \\nabla_\\perp \\delta p_1\n\\tag{16.26}\\]\nIn higher frequency cases, the Alfvén resonance condition Equation 16.20 is modified as \\[\n\\omega^2 = k_\\parallel^2 V_A^2(1-\\omega^2/\\omega_{ci}^2)^2\n\\tag{16.27}\\] because of the finite ion Larmor radius effects [Stix, 1992].\nThe Alfvén resonance singularity can be removed by including non‐MHD effects such as electron inertia or ion Larmor radius corrections.1\nUsing the two-fluid theory, Equation 16.26 can be replaced by \\[\n\\left[ \\omega^2(1-\\lambda_e^2\\nabla_\\perp^2) -k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2(1-r_{Ls}^2\\nabla_\\perp^2) \\right] B_0\\delta B_\\perp = ik_\\parallel v_A^2\\nabla_\\perp \\delta p_1\n\\tag{16.28}\\] which includes electron inertial effects with \\(\\lambda_e = c/\\omega_{pe}\\) being the plasma skin depth or electron inertial length, and electron pressure effects on the ion acoustic Larmor radius scale \\(r_{Ls}^2= k_B T_E/m_i\\Omega_i^2\\). The relative importance of electron pressure versus electron inertial effects is determined by \\(r_{Ls}/\\lambda_e\\): the pressure effect is dominant if \\(r_{Ls}/\\lambda_e = nk_B T_e/\\mu_0 B^2 \\sqrt{m_i/m_e} &gt; 1\\), which occurs when \\(\\beta_e / 2 &gt; \\sqrt{m_e/m_i} = 0.02\\). Near the magnetopause, electron inertial effects are typically not important except at locations where \\(k_\\parallel \\rightarrow 0\\) such as in a sheared field or reconnection geometry.\nThus what’s usually been considered to remove the singularity is the ion kinetic effects, where we end up coupling fast waves with kinetic Alfvén waves of the dispersion relation Equation 10.81. Using the kinetic theory Equation 16.26 can be modified as \\[\n\\left[ \\omega^2 \\hat{K}_1 - k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2\\left( 1+\\frac{T_e}{T_i}\\hat{K}_2 \\right) \\right] B_0\\delta B_\\perp = ik_\\parallel v_A^2\\nabla_\\perp \\delta p_1\n\\tag{16.29}\\] where \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{K}_1 = ??? \\\\\n\\hat{K}_2 = ???\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt can shown that under certain approximations (Pade approximation and \\(\\zeta_e\\ll 1\\)), the left hand side of Equation 16.29 becomes the kinetic Alfvén wave \\[\nk_\\parallel^2 v_A^2 \\left[ 1 + \\left(1+\\frac{T_e}{T_i}\\right)k_\\perp^2 r_{iL}^2 \\right] = ik_\\parallel v_A^2\\nabla_\\perp \\delta p_1\n\\tag{16.30}\\]\nIon Landau damping may be important when \\(\\zeta_i = \\omega/\\sqrt{2}k_\\parallel v_{i,th} \\sim 1\\) (I can feel this from Bellan, but how exactly???).\nFrom the cold MHD theory the nonzero azimuthal/y wavenumber is necessary for wave coupling (Equation 16.16). However, finite-frequency effects can remove the decoupling when \\(k_y=0\\), as orginally noted by (1979). The energy absorption rate can be expressed as a function of \\(k_y\\) and \\(k_z\\) so even if \\(k_y=0\\), as long as \\(k_z l^2 (\\omega/\\Omega_i)\\neq 0\\) (\\(l\\) is a length scale related to \\(\\omega, v_A, \\Omega_i\\), and \\(k_z\\)), we can still get energy absorption.",

For simplicity, let us confine our attention to a one-dimensional model with no magnetic field Figure 17.2. Suppose there is no appreciable electric field inside the plasma; we can then let the potential \\(\\phi\\) be zero there. When ions and electrons hit the wall, they recombine and are lost. Since electrons have much higher thermal velocities than ions, they are lost faster and leave the plasma with a net positive charge. The plasma must then have potential positive with respect to the wall; i.e., the wall potential \\(\\phi_w\\) is negative. This potential cannot be distributed over the entire plasma, since Debye shielding will confine the potential variation to a layer of the order of several Debye lengths in thickness. This layer, which must exist on all cold walls with which the plasma is in contact, is called a sheath. The function of a sheath is to form a potential barrier so that the more mobile species, usually electrons, is confined. electrostatically. The height of the barrier adjusts itself so that the flux of electrons that wave enough energy to go over the barrier to the wall is just equal to the flux of ions reaching the wall.",

The Coulomb barrier \\(e\\phi_w\\) adjusts itself that equal numbers of ions and electrons reach the walls per second.\n\n\n\n\n17.1.1 The Planar Sheath Equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: The potential \\(\\phi\\) in a planar sheath. Cold ions are assumed to enter the sheath with a uniform velocity \\(u_0\\).\n\n\n\nRecall that the Debye length is derived from linearing Poisson’s equation. To examine the exact behavior of \\(\\phi(x)\\) in the sheath, we must treat the nonlinear problem: we shall find that there is not always a solution. Figure 17.3 shows the situation near one of the walls. At the plane \\(x=0\\), ions are imagined to enter the sheath region from the main plasma with a drift velocity \\(u_0\\). This drift is needed to accout for the loss of ions to the wall from the region in which they were created by ionization. For simplicity, we assume \\(T_i=0\\), so that all ions have the velocity \\(u_0\\) at \\(x=0\\). We consider the steady state problem in a collisionless sheath region. The potential \\(\\phi\\) is assumed to decrease monotonically with \\(x\\). Actually, \\(\\phi\\) could have spatial oscillations, and then there would be trapped particles in the steady state. This does not happend in practice because dissipative processes tend to destroy any such highly organized state.\nIf \\(u(x)\\) is the ion velocity, conservation of energy requires\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2}mu^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mu_0^2 - e\\phi(x) \\\\\nu = \\Big( u_0^2 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i} \\Big)^{1/2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{17.1}\\]\nThe ion equation of continuity then gives the ion density \\(n_i\\) in terms of the density \\(n_0\\) in the main plasma:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_0 u_0 &= n_i(x) u(x) \\\\\nn_i(x) &= n_0 \\Big( 1 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \\Big)^{1/2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{17.2}\\]\nIn steady state, the electrons will follow the Boltzmann relation closely,\n\\[\nn_e(x) = n_0 \\exp(e\\phi/k_B T_e)\n\\]\nPoisson’s equation is then\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = e(n_e - n_i) = en_0\\Big[ \\exp\\Big( \\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e} \\Big) - \\Big( 1 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \\Big)^{1/2} \\Big]\n\\tag{17.3}\\]\nThe structure of this equation can be seen more clearly if we simplify it with the following changes in notation:\n\\[\n\\chi\\equiv -\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\quad \\xi\\equiv\\frac{x}{\\lambda_D} = x\\Big( \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e} \\Big)^{1/2}\\quad \\mu\\equiv\\frac{u_0}{(k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}}\n\\]\nThen it can be written as\n\\[\n\\chi^{\\prime\\prime} = \\Big( 1+\\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\Big)^{-1/2} - e^{-\\chi}\n\\tag{17.4}\\]\nwhere the prime denotes \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\). This is the nonlinear equation of a plane sheath, and it has an acceptable solution only if \\(\\mu\\) is large enough. The reason for the symbol \\(\\mu\\) will become apparent in the following section on shock waves.\n\n\n17.1.2 The Bohm Sheath Criterion\nEquation 17.4 can be integrated once by multiplying both sides by \\(\\chi^\\prime\\):\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\xi \\chi^\\prime \\chi^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathrm{d}\\xi_1 = \\int_0^\\xi \\Big( 1+\\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\Big)^{-1/2} \\chi^\\prime \\mathrm{d}\\xi_1 - \\int_0^\\xi e^{-\\chi} \\chi^\\prime \\mathrm{d}\\xi_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\xi_1\\) is a dummy variable. Since \\(\\chi=0\\) at \\(\\xi=0\\), the integration easily yield\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}({\\chi^\\prime}^2 - {\\chi_0^\\prime}^2) = \\mu^2 \\Big[ \\big(1 + \\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\big)^{1/2} - 1 \\Big] + e^{-\\chi} -1\n\\tag{17.5}\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{E}=0\\) in the plasma, we must set \\(\\chi_0^\\prime=0\\) at \\(\\xi=0\\). A second integration to find \\(\\chi\\) would have to be done numerically; but whatever the answer is, the right-hand side of Equation 17.5 must be positive for all \\(\\chi\\). In particular, for \\(\\chi\\ll 1\\), we can expand the right-hand terms in Taylor series:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu^2 \\Big[ 1+\\frac{\\chi}{\\mu^2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\chi^2}{\\mu^4}+ ... -1 \\Big] + 1-\\chi+\\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2+...-1 &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2 \\Big( -\\frac{1}{\\mu^2} + 1\\Big) &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\mu^2 &gt; 1 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad u_0&gt;(k_BT_e/m_i)^{1/2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{17.6}\\]\nThis inequality is know as the Bohm sheath criterion. It says that ions must enter the sheath with a velocity greater than the acoustic velocity \\(v_s\\). To give the ions this directed velocity \\(u_0\\), there must be a finite electric field in the plasma. Our assumption that \\(\\chi^\\prime=0\\) at \\(\\xi=0\\) is therefore only an approximate one, made possible by the fact that the scale of the sheath region is usually much smaller than the scale of the main plasma region in which the ions are accelerated. The value of \\(u_0\\) is somewhat arbitrary, depending on where we choose to put the boundary \\(x=0\\) between the plasma and the sheath. Of course, the ion flux \\(n_0u_0\\) is fixed by the ion production rate, so if \\(u_0\\) is varies, the value of \\(n_0\\) at \\(x=0\\) will vary inversely with \\(u_0\\). If the ions have finite temperature, the critical drift velocity \\(u_0\\) will be somewhat lower.\nThe physical reason for the Bohm criterion is easily seen from a plot of the ion and electron densities vs. \\(\\chi\\) ?fig-sheath-n-variation. The electron density \\(n_e\\) falls exponentially with \\(\\chi\\), according to the Boltzmann relation. The ion density also falls, since the ions are accelerated by the sheath potential. If the ions start with a large energy, \\(n_i(\\chi)\\) falls slowly, since the sheath field causes a relatively minor change in the ions’ velocity. If the ions start with a small energy, \\(n_i(\\chi)\\) falls fast, and can go belwo the \\(n_e\\) curve. In that case, \\(n_e-n_i\\) is positive near \\(\\chi=0\\); and Equation 17.4 tells us that \\(\\phi(x)\\) must curve upward, in contradiction to the requirement that the sheath must repel electrons. In order for this not to happen, the slope of \\(n_i(\\chi)\\) at \\(\\chi=0\\) must be smaller (in absolute value) than that of \\(n_e(\\chi)\\); this condition is identical with the condition \\(\\mu^2&gt;1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.4: Variation of ion and electron density (logarithmic scale) with normalized potential \\(\\chi\\) in a sheath. The ion density is dwawn for two caes: \\(u_0\\) greater than and \\(u_0\\) less than the critical velocity.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.3 The Child-Langmuir Law\nSince \\(n_e(\\chi)\\) falls exponentially with \\(\\chi\\), the electron density can be neglected in the region of large \\(\\chi\\) next to the wall (or any negative electrode). Poisson’s equation is then approximately\n\\[\n\\chi^{\\prime\\prime} \\approx \\Big( 1+\\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\Big)^{-1/2} \\approx \\frac{\\mu}{(2\\chi)^{1/2}}\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(\\chi^\\prime\\) and integrating from \\(\\xi_1=\\xi_s\\) to \\(\\xi_1=\\xi\\), we have\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}({\\chi^\\prime}^2 - {\\chi_s^\\prime}^2) = \\sqrt{2}\\mu(\\chi^{1/2} - \\chi_s^{1/2})\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\xi_s\\) is the place where we started neglecting \\(n_e\\). We can redefine the zero of \\(\\chi\\) so that \\(\\chi_s=1\\) at \\(\\xi=\\xi_s\\). We shall also neglect \\(\\chi_s^\\prime\\), since the slope of the potential curve can be expected to be much steeper in the \\(n_e=0\\) region than in the finite-\\(n_e\\) region. Then the above equation becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\chi^\\prime}^2 &= 2^{3/2}\\mu\\chi^{1/2} \\\\\n\\chi^\\prime &= 2^{3/4}\\mu^{1/2}\\chi^{1/4} \\\\\n\\mathrm{d}\\chi/\\chi^{1/4} &= 2^{3/4}\\mu^{1/2} \\mathrm{d}\\xi\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIntegrating from \\(\\xi=\\xi_s\\) to \\(\\xi=\\xi_s+\\mathrm{d}/\\lambda_D = \\xi_{\\text{wall}}\\), we have\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3}\\chi_w^{3/4} = 2^{3/4}\\mu^{1/2}\\mathrm{d}/\\lambda_D\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{9}\\frac{\\chi_w^{3/2}}{\\mathrm{d}^2}\\lambda_D^2\n\\]\nChanging back to the variables \\(u_0\\) and \\(\\phi\\), and noting that the ion current into the wall is \\(J=en_0u_0\\), we then find\n\\[\nJ = \\frac{4}{9}\\Big( \\frac{2e}{m_i} \\Big)^{1/2} \\frac{\\epsilon_0|\\phi_w|^{3/2}}{\\mathrm{d}^2}\n\\tag{17.7}\\]\nThis is just the well-known Child-Langmuir law of space-charge-limited current in a plane diode.\nThe potential variation in a plasma-wall system can be divided into three parts. Nearest the wall is an electron-free region whose thickness \\(\\mathrm{d}\\) given by Equation 17.7. Here \\(J\\) is determined by the ion production rate, and \\(\\phi_w\\) is determined by the equility of electron and ion fluxes. Next comes a region in which \\(n_e\\) is appreciable; as shown in the linear theory from which the scale of Debye length is derived. Finally, there is a region with much larger scale length, the “presheath”, in which the ions are accelerated to the required velocity \\(u_0\\) by a potential drop \\(|\\phi|\\ge \\frac{1}{2}k_B T_E/e\\). Depending on the experiment, the scale of the presheath may be set by the plasma radius, the collisional mean free path, or the ionization mechanism. The potential distribution, of course, varies smoothly; the division into three regions is made only for convenience and is made possible by the disparity in scale lengths. In the early days of gas discharges, sheaths could be observed as dark layers where no electrons were present to excite atoms to emission. Subsequently, the potential variation has been measured by the electrostatic deflection of a thin electron beam shot parallel to a wall.\n\n\n17.1.4 Electrostatic Probes\nThe sheath criterion Equation 17.6 can be used to estimate the flux of ions to a negatively biased probe in a plasma. If the probe has a surface area \\(A\\), and if the ions entering the sheath have a drift velocity \\(u_0\\ge (k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}\\), then the ion current collected is\n\\[\nI = n_s e A(k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThe electron current can be neglected if the probe is sufficiently negative (several times \\(k_B T_e\\)) relative to the plasma to repel all but the tail of the Maxwellian electron distribution. The density \\(n_s\\) is the plasma density at the edge of the sheath. Let us define the sheath edge to be the place where \\(u_0\\) is exactly \\((k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}\\). To accelerate ions to this velocity requires a presheath potential \\(|\\phi|\\ge\\frac{1}{2}k_B T_e/e\\), so that the sheath edge has a potential\n\\[\n\\phi_s \\simeq -\\frac{1}{2}k_B T_e/e\n\\]\nrelative to the body of the plasma. If the electrons are Maxwellian, this determines \\(n_s\\):\n\\[\nn_s = n_0 e^{e\\phi_s/k_BT_e} = n_0 e^{-1/2} \\approx 0.61 n_0\n\\]\nFor our purposes it is accurate enough to replace 0.61 with a round number like 1/2; thus, the “saturation ion current” to a negative probe is approximately\n\\[\nI_B \\simeq \\frac{1}{2}n_0 e A (k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\\(I_B\\), sometimes called the “Bohm current”, give the plasma density easily, once the temperature is known.\nIf the Debye length \\(\\lambda_D\\), and hence the sheath thickness, is very small compared to the probe dimensions, the area of the sheath edge is effectively the same as the area \\(A\\) of the probe surface, regardless of its shape. At low densities, however, \\(\\lambda_D\\) can become large, so that some ions entering the sheath can orbit the probe and miss it. Calculations of orbits for various probe shapes were first made by I. Langmuir and L. Tonks — hence the name “Langmuir probe” ascribed to this method of measurement. Though tedious, these calculations can give accurate determinations of plasma density because an arbitrary definition of sheath edge does not have to be made. By varying the probe voltage, the Maxwellian electron distribution is sampled, and the current-voltage curve of a Langmuir probe can also yield the electron temperature. The electrostatic probe was the first plasma diagnostic and is still the simplest and the most localized measurement device. Unfortunately, material electrodes can be inserted only in low-density, cool plasma.\nMore detailed explanation of how to measure the plasma density using a Langmuir probe is given here.",

    "text": "17.2 Ion Acoustic Shock Waves\nWhen a jet travels faster than sound, it creates a shock wave. This is a basically nonlinear phenomenon, since there is no period when the wave is small and growing. The jet is faster than the speed of waves in air, so the undisturbed medium cannot be “warned” by precursor signals before the large shock wave hits it. In hydrodynamic shock waves, collisions are dominant. Shock waves also exist in plasmas, even when there are no collisions. A magnetic shock, the “bow shock”, is generated by the earth as it plows through the interplanetary plasma while dragging along a dipole magnetic field. We shall discuss a simpler example: a collisionless, one-dimensional shock wave which develops from a large-amplitude ion wave.\n(Normal space plasma textbooks discuss this part starting from R-H relations. I don’t like that.)\n\n17.2.1 The Sagdeev Potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5: Typical potential distribution in an ion acoustic shock wave. The wave moves to the left, so that in the wave frame ions stream into the wave from the left with velocity \\(u_0\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5 shows the idealized potential profile of an ion acoustic shock wave. The reason for this shape will be given presently. The wave is traveling to the left with a velocity \\(u_0\\). If we go to the frame moving with the wave, the function \\(\\phi(x)\\) will be constant in time, and we will see a stream of plasma impinging on the wave from the left with a velocity \\(u_0\\). For simplicity, let \\(T_i\\) be zero, so that all the ions are incident with the same velocity \\(u_0\\), and let hte electrons be Maxwellian. Since the shock moves much more slowly than the electron thermal speed, the shift in the center velocity of the Maxwellian can be neglected. The velocity of the ions in the shock wave is, from energy conservation,\n\\[\nu = \\Big( u_0^2 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i} \\Big)^{1/2}\n\\]\nIf \\(n_0\\) is the density of the undisturbed plasma, the ion density in the shock is\n\\[\nn_i = \\frac{n_0 u_0}{u} = n_0 \\Big( 1 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \\Big)^{-1/2}\n\\]\nThe electron density is given by the Boltzmann relation. Poisson’s equation then gives\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = e(n_e - n_i) = en_0\\Big[ \\exp\\Big( \\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e} \\Big) - \\Big( 1 - \\frac{2e\\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \\Big)^{1/2} \\Big]\n\\]\nThis is, of course, the same Equation 17.3 as we had for a sheath. A shock wave is no more than a sheath moving through a plasma. We now introduce the dimensionless variables\n\\[\n\\chi\\equiv \\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\quad \\xi\\equiv\\frac{x}{\\lambda_D} = x\\Big( \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e} \\Big)^{1/2}\\quad \\mu\\equiv\\frac{u_0}{(k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}}\n\\]\nNote that we have changed the sign in the definition of \\(\\chi\\) so as to keep \\(\\chi\\) positive in this problem. The quantity \\(\\mu\\) is called the Mach number of the shock. Poisson’s equation can now be written\n\\[\n\\chi^{\\prime\\prime} = e^{\\chi} - \\Big( 1 - \\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\Big)^{-1/2} = -\\frac{dV(\\chi)}{\\mathrm{d}\\chi}\n\\tag{17.8}\\]\nwhich differs from the sheath Equation 17.4 only because of the change in sign of \\(\\chi\\).\nThe behavior of the solution of Equation 17.8 was made clear by R. Z. Sagdeev, who used an analogy to an oscillator in a potential well. The displacement \\(x\\) of an oscillator subjected to a force \\(-mdV(x)/\\mathrm{d}x\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\ddot{x} = -dV/\\mathrm{d}x\n\\]\nIf the right-hand side of Equation 17.8 is defined as \\(-dV/\\mathrm{d}x\\), the equation is the same as that of an oscillator, with the potential \\(\\chi\\) playing the role of \\(\\chi\\), and \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\) replacing \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}t\\). The quasipotential \\(V(\\chi)\\) is sometimes called the Sagdeev potential. The function \\(V(x)\\) can be found from Equation 17.8 by integration with the boundary condition \\(V(\\chi)=0\\) at \\(\\chi=0\\):\n\\[\nV(\\chi) = 1-e^\\chi + \\mu^2 \\Big[ 1 - \\Big( 1-\\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\Big)^{1/2} \\Big]\n\\tag{17.9}\\]\nFor \\(\\mu\\) lying in a certain range, this function has the shape shown in Figure 17.6. If this were a real well, a particle entering from the left will go to the right-hand side of the well (\\(x&gt;0\\)), reflect, and return to \\(x=0\\), making a single transit. Similarly, a quasiparticle in our analogy will make a single excursion to positive \\(\\chi\\) and return to \\(\\chi =0\\), as shown in Figure 17.7. Such a pulse is called a soliton: it is a potential and density disturbance propagating to the left in Figure 17.7 with velocity \\(u_0\\). (I DON’T FULLY UNDERSTAND!!!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: The Sagdeev potential \\(V(\\chi)\\). The upper arrow is the trajectory of a quasiparticle describing a soliton: it is reflected at the right and returns. The lower arrows show the motion of a quasiparticle that has lost energy and is trapped in the potential well. The bouncing back and forth describes the oscillations behind a shock front.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.7: The potential in a soliton moving to the left.\n\n\n\nNow, if a particle suffers a loss of energy while in the well, it will never return to \\(x=0\\) but will oscillate (in time) about some positive value of \\(x\\). Similarly, a little dissipation will make the potential of a shock wave oscillate (in space) about some positive value of \\(\\phi\\). This is exactly the behavoir depicted in Figure 17.5. Actually, dissipation is not needed for this: reflection of ions from the shock front has the same effect. To understand this, imagine that the ions have a small thermal spread in energy and that the height \\(e\\phi\\) of the wave front is just large enough to reflect some of the ions back to the left, while the rest go over the potential hill to the right. The reflected ions cause an increase in ion density in the upstream region to the left of the shock front (Figure 17.5). This means that the quantity\n\\[\n\\chi^\\prime = \\frac{1}{n_0}\\int_0^\\xi (n_e - n_i)\\mathrm{d}\\xi_1\n\\]\nis decreased. Since \\(\\chi^\\prime\\) is the analog of \\(\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}t\\) in the oscillator problem, our virtual oscillator has lost velocity and is trapped in the potential well of Figure 17.6.\n\n\n17.2.2 The Critical Mach Numbers\nSolutions of either the soliton type or the wave-train type exist only for a range of \\(\\mu\\). A lower limit for \\(\\mu\\) is given by the condition that \\(V(\\chi)\\) be a potential well, rather than a hill. Expanding Equation 17.9 for \\(\\chi\\ll 1\\) yields\n\\[\n\\mu^2 &gt; 1 \\quad u_0&gt;(k_BT_e/m_i)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThis is exactly the same, both physically and mathematically, as the Bohm criterion for the existence of a sheath (Equation 17.6).\nAn upper limit to \\(\\mu\\) is imposed by the condition that the function \\(V(\\chi)\\) of Figure 17.6 must cross the \\(\\chi\\) axis for \\(\\chi&gt;0\\); otherwise, the virtual particle will not be reflected, and the potential will rise indefinitely. From Equation 17.9, we require\n\\[\ne^\\chi - 1 &lt; \\mu^2 \\Big[ 1- \\big( 1-\\frac{2\\chi}{\\mu^2} \\Big)^{1/2} \\Big]\n\\]\nfor some \\(\\chi&gt;0\\). If the lower critical Mach number is surpassed (\\(\\mu&gt;1\\)), the left-and side, representing the integral of the electron density from zero to \\(\\chi\\), is initially larger than the right-hand side, representing the integral of the ion density. As \\(\\chi\\) increases, the right-hand side can catch up with the left-hand side if \\(\\mu^2\\) is not too large. However, because of the square root, the largest value \\(\\chi\\) can have is \\(\\mu^2/2\\). This is because \\(e\\phi\\) cannot exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}m_iu_0^2\\); otherwise, ions would be excluded from the plasma in the downstream region. Inserting the largest value of \\(\\chi\\) into the above equation, we have\n\\[\n\\exp(\\mu^2/2) - 1 &lt; \\mu \\quad\\text{or}\\quad \\mu &lt; 1.6\n\\]\nThis is the upper critical Mach number. Shock waves in a cold-ion plasma therefore exist only for \\(1&lt;\\mu&lt;1.6\\).\nAs in the case of sheaths, the physical situation is best explained by a diagram of \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_e\\) vs. \\(\\chi\\) (Figure 17.8). This diagram differs from ?fig-sheath-n-variation because of the change of sign of \\(\\phi\\). Since the ions are now decelerated rather than accelerated, \\(n_i\\) will appraoch infinity at \\(\\chi=\\mu^2/2\\). The lowe critical Mach number ensures that the \\(n_i\\) curve lies below the \\(n_e\\) curve at small \\(\\chi\\), so that the potential \\(\\phi(x)\\) starts off with the right sign for its curvature. When the curve \\(n_{i1}\\) crosses the \\(n_e\\) curve, the soliton (Figure 17.7) has an inflection point. Finally, when \\(\\chi\\) is large enough that the areas under the \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_e\\) curves are equal, the soliton reaches a peak, and the \\(n_{i1}\\) and \\(n_e\\) curves are retraced as \\(\\chi\\) goes back to zero. The equality of the areas ensures that the net charge in the soliton is zero; therefore, there is no electric field outside. If \\(\\mu\\) is larger than 1.6, we have the curve \\(n_{i2}\\), in which the area under the curve is too small even when \\(\\chi\\) has reached its maximum value of \\(\\mu^2/2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: Variation of ion and electron density (logarithmic scale) with normalized potential \\(\\chi\\) in a soliton. The ion density is drawn for two cases: Mach number greater than and less than 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.3 Wave Steepening\nIf one propagates an ion wave in a cold-ion plasma, it will have the phase velocity given by\n\\[\nv_p = \\Big( \\frac{k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i} \\Big)^{1/2} = \\Big( \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i} \\Big)^{1/2}\n\\]\ncorresponding to \\(\\mu=1\\). How, then, can one create shocks with \\(\\mu&gt;1\\)? One must remember that the above phase velocity was a linear result valid only at small amplitudes. As the amplitude is increased, an ion wave speeds up and also changes from a sine wave to a sawtooth shape with a steep leading edge (Figure 17.9). The reason is that the wave electric field has accelerated the ions. In Figure 17.9, ions at the peak of the potential distribution have a large velocity in the direction of \\(v_\\phi\\) than those at the trough, since they have just experienced a period of acceleration as the wave passed by. In linear theory, this difference in velocity is taken into account, but not the displacement resulting from it. In nonlinear theory, it is easy to see that the ions at the peak are shifted to the right, while those at the trough are shifted to the left, thus steepening the wave shape. Since the density perturbation is in pahse with the potential, more ions are accelerated to the right than to the left, and the wave causes a net mass flow in the direction of propagation. This causes the wave velocity to exceed the acoustic speed in the undisturbed plasma, so that \\(\\mu\\) is larger than unity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.9: A large-amplitude ion wave steepens so that the leading edge has a large slope than the trailing edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.4 Double Layers\nA phenomenon related to sheaths and ion acoustic shocks is that of the double layer. This is a localized potential jump, believed to occur naturally in the ionosphere, which neither propagates nor is attached to a boundary. The name comes from the successive layers of net positive and net negative charge that are necessary to create a step in \\(\\phi(x)\\). Such a step can remain stationary in space only if there is a plasma flow that Doppler shifts a shock front down to zero velocity in the lab frame, or if the distribution functions of the transmitted and reflected electrons and ions on each side of the discontinuity are specially tailored so as to make this possible. In natural situations double layers are likely to arise where there are gradients in the magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), not where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is zero or uniform, as in laboratory simulations. In that case, the \\(\\mu\\nabla B\\) force can play a large role in localizing a double layer away from all boundaries. Indeed, the thermal barrier in tandem mirror reactors is an example of a double layer with strong magnetic trapping.",

Even the esoteric example of comet tails, formed by the pressure of sunlight, is tainted by the added effect of particles streaming from the sun. When high-powered microwaves or laser beams are used to heat or confine plasmas, however, the radiation pressure can reach several hundred thousand atmospheres! When applied to a plasma, this force is coupled to the particles in a somewhat subtle way and is called the ponderomotive force. Many nonlinear phenomena have a simple explanation in terms of the ponderomotive force.\nThe easiest way to derive this nonlinear force is to consider the motion of an electron in the oscillating \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) fields of a wave. We neglect dc \\(\\mathbf{E}_0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) fields. The electron equation of motion is\n\\[\nm\\dot{\\mathbf{v}} = -e[\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r})]\n\\]\nThis equation is exact if \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are evaluated at the instantaneous position of the electron. The nonlinearity comes partly from the \\(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\), which is second order because both \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) vanish in the equilibrium, so that the term is no larger than \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_1\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) are the linear-theory values. The other part of the nonlinearity, as we shall see, comes from evaluating \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) at the actual position of the particle rather than its initial position. Assume a wave electric field of the form\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{E}_s(\\mathbf{r})\\cos\\omega t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{E}_s(\\mathbf{r})\\) contains the spatial dependence. In first order, we may neglect the \\(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) term in the equation of motion and evaluate \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) at the initial position \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\). We have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_1 &=  -e\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}_0)\\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_1 &= -(e/m\\omega)\\mathbf{E}_s\\sin\\omega t = \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_1 \\\\\n\\delta \\mathbf{r}_1 &= (e/m\\omega^2)\\mathbf{E}_s\\cos\\omega t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is important to note that in a nonlinear calculation, we cannot write \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) and takes its real part later. Instead, we write its real part explicitly as \\(\\cos\\omega t\\). This is because products of oscillating factors appera in nonlinear theory, and the operations of multiplying and taking the real part do not commute.\nGoing to second order, we expand \\(\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})\\) about \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}_0) + (\\delta\\mathbf{r}_0\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E}|_{r=r_0} + ...\n\\]\nWe must now add the term \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_1\\), where \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) is given by Maxwell’s equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} &= -\\dot{\\mathbf{B}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_1 &= -(1/\\omega)\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_s|_{r=r_0}\\sin\\omega t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe second-order part of the equation of motion is then\n\\[\nm\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_2 = -e[(\\delta\\mathbf{r}_1\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}_1\\times\\mathbf{B}_1]\n\\]\nInserting the expressions of \\(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\delta\\mathbf{r}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) into the above and averaging over time, we have\n\\[\nm\\left&lt; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_2}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right&gt; = -\\frac{e^2}{m\\omega^2}\\frac{1}{2}[(\\mathbf{E}_s\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E}_s + \\mathbf{E}_s\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}_s)] = \\mathbf{f}_{NL}\n\\tag{17.10}\\]\nHere we have used \\(\\left&lt;\\sin^2\\omega t\\right&gt; = \\left&lt;\\cos^2\\omega t\\right&gt;=\\frac{1}{2}\\). The double cross product can be written as the sum of two terms, one of which cancels the \\((\\mathbf{E}_s\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E}_s\\) term.\nWhat remains is\n\\[\n\\mathbf{f}_{NL} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{e^2}{m\\omega^2}\\nabla E_s^2\n\\]\nThis is the effective nonlinear force on a single electron. The force per \\(m^3\\) is \\(\\mathbf{f}_{NL}\\) times the electron density \\(n_0\\), which can be written in terms of \\(\\omega_p^2\\). Since \\(E_s^2 = 2\\left&lt;E^2\\right&gt;\\), we finally have for the ponderomotive force the formula\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{NL} = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\nabla\\frac{\\left&lt;\\epsilon_0 E^2\\right&gt;}{2}\n\\tag{17.11}\\]\nIf the wave is electromagnetic, the second term in Equation 17.10 is dominant, and the physical mechanism for \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\) is as follows. Electrons oscillate in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), but the wave magnetic field distorts their orbits. That is, the Lorentz force \\(-e\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) pushes the electrons in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) (since \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) is in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)). The phases of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are such that the motion does not average to zero over an oscillation, but there is a secular drift along \\(\\mathbf{k}\\). If the wave has uniform amplitude, no force is needed to maintain this drift; but if the wave amplitude varies, the electrons will pile up in regions of small amplitude, and a force is needed to overcome the space charge. This is why the effective force \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\) is proportional to the gradient of \\(\\left&lt;E^2 \\right&gt;\\). Since the drift for each electron is the same, \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\) is proportional to the density — hence the factor \\(\\omega_p^2/\\omega^2\\).\nIf the wave is electrostatic, the first term in Equation 17.10 is dominant. Then the physical mechanism is simply that an electron oscillating along \\(\\mathbf{k}\\parallel\\mathbf{E}\\) moves farther in the half-cycle when it is moving from a strong-field region to a weak-field region than vice versa, so there is a net drift.\nAlthough \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\) acts mainly on the electrons, the force is ultimately transmitted to the ions, since it is a low-frequency or dc effect. When electrons are bunched by \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\), a charge-separation field \\(\\mathbf{E}_{cs}\\) is created. The total force felt by the electrons is\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_e = -e\\mathbf{E}_{cs} + \\mathbf{F}_{NL}\n\\]\nSince the ponderomotive force on the ions is smaller by \\(\\Omega_p^2/\\omega_p^2 = m_e/m_i\\), the force on the ion fluid is approximately\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_i = e\\mathbf{E}_{cs}\n\\]\nSumming the last two equations, we find that the force on the plasma is \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\).\nA direct effect of \\(\\mathbf{F}_{NL}\\) is the self-focusing of laser light in a plasma. In Figure 17.10 we see that a laser beam of finite diameter causes a radially directed ponderomotive force in a plasma. This force moves plasma out of the beam, so that \\(\\omega_p\\) is lower and hte dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\) is higher inside the beam than outside. The plasma then acts as a convex lens, focusing the beam to a smaller diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.10: Self-focusing of a laser beam is caused by the ponderomotive force.",

    "section": "17.4 Parametric Instabilities",
    "text": "17.4 Parametric Instabilities\nThe most thoroughly investigated nonlinear wave-wave interactions are the “parametric instabilities”, so called because of an analogy with parametric amplifiers, well-known devices in electrical engineering. A reason for the relatively advanced state of understanding of this subject is that the theory is basically a linear one, but linear about a non-oscillating equilibirum.\nThe parametric instabilities arise when a nonlinearity such as a pressure gradient couples waves. The waves must allow frequency and wavenumber matching which are consequences of energy and momentum conservation. But parametric instabilities are not limited to waves but also arise in nonlinear resonances such as a plasma sheath. A very common parametric wave instability arises from the decay of strong electromagnetic wave, the “pump”, into two electrostatic waves, an electron plasma waves and an ion acoustic waves. It is called a “decay” instability when the pump excites a lower frequency sideband, the electron plasma wave, and the difference mode, an ion acoustic wave. These three modes are the only ones in an unmagnetized plasma.\nSee here for an observation example from a lab experiment. The following video demonstrates some intuitive lab experiments from parametric excitation to parametric instability.\n\n\n\n17.4.1 Coupled Oscillators\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.11: A mechanical analog of a parametric instability.\n\n\n\nConsider the mechanical model of Figure 17.11, in which two oscillators M1 and M2 are coupled to a bar resting on a pivot. The pivot P is made to slide back and forth at a frequency \\(\\omega_0\\), while the natural frequencies of the oscillators are \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\). It is clear that, in the absence of friction, the pivot encounters no resistance as long as M1 and M2 are not moving. Furthermore, if P is not moving and M2 is put into motion, M1 will move; but as long as ω2 is not the natural frequency of M1, the amplitude will be small. Suppose now that both P and M2 are set into motion. The displacement of M1 is proportional to the product of the displacement of M2 and the length of the lever arm and, hence, will vary in time as \\[\n\\cos\\omega_2 t \\cos\\omega_0 t = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos[(\\omega_2 + \\omega_0)t] + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos[(\\omega_2 - \\omega_0)t]\n\\]\nIf \\(\\omega_1\\) is equal to either \\(\\omega_2+\\omega_0\\) or \\(\\omega_2-\\omega_0\\), M1 will be resonantly excited and will grow to large amplitude. Once M1 starts oscillating, M2 will also gain energy, because one of the beat frequencies of \\(\\omega_1\\) with \\(\\omega_0\\) is just \\(\\omega_2\\). Thus, once either oscillator is started, each will be excited by the other, and the system is unstable. The energy, of course, comes from the “pump” P, which encounters resistance once the rod is slanted. If the pump is strong enough, its oscillation amplitude is unaffected by M1 and M2; the instability can then be treated by a linear theory. In a plasma, the oscillators P, M1, and M2 may be different types of waves.\n\n\n17.4.2 Frequency Matching\nThe equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator \\(x_1\\) is \\[\n\\ddot{x}_1 + \\omega_1^2 x_1 = 0\n\\tag{17.12}\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega_1\\) is its resonant frequency. If it is driven by a time-dependent force which is proportional to the product of the amplitude \\(E_0\\) of the driver, or pump, and the amplitude \\(x_2\\) of a second oscillator, the equation of motion becomes \\[\n\\ddot{x}_1 + \\omega_1^2 x_1 = c_1x_2E_0\n\\tag{17.13}\\] where \\(c_1\\) is a constant indicating the strength of the coupling. A similar equation holds for \\(x_2\\): \\[\n\\ddot{x}_2 + \\omega_1^2 x_2 = c_2x_1E_0\n\\tag{17.14}\\]\nLet \\(x_1=\\bar{x}_1 \\cos\\omega t\\), \\(x_2=\\bar{x}_2 \\cos\\omega^\\prime t\\), and \\(E_0=\\bar{E}_0 \\cos\\omega_0 t\\). Equation 17.14 becomes \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\omega_2^2 - {\\omega^\\prime}^2)\\bar{x}_2\\cos\\omega^\\prime t &= c_2\\bar{E}_0\\bar{x}_1\\cos\\omega_0 t\\cos\\omega t \\\\\n&= c_2\\bar{E}_0\\bar{x}_1 \\frac{1}{2}\\{ \\cos[(\\omega_0 + \\omega)t] + \\cos[(\\omega_0 - \\omega)t]  \\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe driving terms on the right can excite oscillators \\(x_2\\) with frequencies \\[\n\\omega^\\prime = \\omega_0\\pm\\omega\n\\tag{17.15}\\]\nIn the absence of nonlinear interactions, \\(x_2\\) can only have the frequency \\(\\omega_2\\), so we must have \\(ω^\\prime = \\omega_2\\). However, the driving terms can cause a frequency shift so that \\(ω^\\prime\\) is only approximately equal to \\(\\omega_2\\). Furthermore, \\(\\omega^\\prime\\) can be complex, since there is damping (which has been neglected so far for simplicity), or there can be growth (if there is an instability). In either case, \\(x_2\\) is an oscillator with finite Q and can respond to a range of frequencies about \\(\\omega_2\\). If \\(\\omega\\) is small, one can see from that both choices for \\(\\omega^\\prime\\) may lie within the bandwidth of \\(x_2\\), and one must allow for the existence of two oscillators, \\(x_2(\\omega_0+\\omega)\\) and \\(x_2(\\omega_0 - \\omega)\\).\nNow let \\(x_1 = \\bar{x}_1\\cos\\omega^{\\prime\\prime}t\\) and \\(x_2 = \\bar{x}_2\\cos[(\\omega_0\\pm \\omega)t]\\) and insert into Equation 17.13: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(\\omega_1^2 - {\\omega^{\\prime\\prime}}^2)\\bar{x}_1\\cos\\omega^{\\prime\\prime} t \\\\\n&= c_1\\bar{E}_0\\bar{x}_2\\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\cos\\{[\\omega_0 + (\\omega_0\\pm\\omega)]t\\} + \\cos\\{ [\\omega_0 - (\\omega_0\\pm\\omega)]t \\}  \\big)\\\\\n&= c_1\\bar{E}_0\\bar{x}_2\\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\cos[(2\\omega_0 \\pm\\omega) t] + \\cos\\omega t  \\big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{17.16}\\]\nThe driving terms can excite not only the original oscillation \\(x_1(\\omega)\\), but also new frequencies \\(\\omega^{\\prime\\prime} = 2\\omega_0\\pm\\omega\\). We shall consider the case \\(|\\omega_0| \\gg |\\omega_1|\\), so that \\(2\\omega_0\\pm\\omega\\) lies outside the range of frequencies to which \\(x_1\\) can respond, and \\(x_1(2\\omega_0\\pm\\omega)\\) can be neglected. We therefore have three oscillators, \\(x_1(\\omega)\\), \\(x_2(\\omega_0-\\omega)\\), and \\(x_2(\\omega_0+\\omega)\\), which are coupled by Equation 17.13 and Equation 17.14: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\omega_1^2 - \\omega^2)x_1(\\omega) - c_1E_0(\\omega_0)[ x_2(\\omega_0-\\omega) + x_2(\\omega_0 + \\omega) ] &= 0 \\\\\n[\\omega_2^2 - (\\omega_0-\\omega)^2]x_2(\\omega_0-\\omega) - c_2E_0(\\omega_0)x_1(\\omega) &= 0 \\\\\n[\\omega_2^2 - (\\omega_0+\\omega)^2]x_2(\\omega_0+\\omega) - c_2E_0(\\omega_0)x_1(\\omega) &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{17.17}\\]\nThe dispersion relation is given by setting the determinant of the coefficients equal to zero: \\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\omega^2 - \\omega_1^2 & c_1E_0 & c_1 E_0 \\\\\nc_2E_0 & (\\omega_0-\\omega)^2 - \\omega_2^2 & 0 \\\\\nc_2E_0 & 0 & (\\omega_0+\\omega)^2 - \\omega_2^2\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n\\tag{17.18}\\]\nA solution with \\(\\Im(\\omega)&gt;0\\) would indicate an instability.\nFor small frequency shifts and small damping or growth rates, we can set \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^\\prime\\) approximately equal to the undisturbed frequencies \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\). Equation 17.15 then gives a frequency matching condition: \\[\n\\omega_0 \\approx \\omega_2 \\pm \\omega_1\n\\tag{17.19}\\]\nWhen the oscillators are waves in a plasma, \\(\\omega t\\) must be replaced by \\(\\omega t - \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}\\). There is then also a wavelength matching condition \\[\n\\mathbf{k}_0 \\approx \\mathbf{k}_2 \\pm \\mathbf{k}_1\n\\tag{17.20}\\] describing spatial beats; that is, the periodicity of points of constructive and destructive interference in space. The two conditions Equation 17.19 and Equation 17.20 are easily understood by analogy with quantum mechanics. Multiplying the former by Planck’s constant \\(\\hbar\\), we have \\[\n\\hbar\\omega_0 = \\hbar\\omega_2 \\pm \\hbar\\omega_1\n\\]\n\\(E_0\\) and \\(x_2\\) may, for instance, be electromagnetic waves, so that \\(\\hbar\\omega_0\\) and \\(\\hbar\\omega_2\\) are the photon energies. The oscillator \\(x_1\\) may be a Langmuir wave, or plasmon, with energy \\(\\hbar\\omega_1\\). Equation 17.17 simply states the conservation of energy. Similarly, Equation 17.16 states the conservation of momentum \\(\\hbar\\mathbf{k}\\).\nFor plasma waves, the simultaneous satisfaction of Equation 17.15 and Equation 17.16 in one-dimensional problems is possible only for certain combinations of waves. The required relationships are best seen on an \\(\\omega-k\\) diagram Figure 17.12. (A) shows the dispersion curves of an electron plasma wave \\(\\omega_2\\) (Bohm-Gross wave) and an ion acoustic wave \\(\\omega_1\\). A large-amplitude electron wave \\((\\omega_0, \\mathbf{k}_0)\\) can decay into a backward moving electron wave \\((\\omega_2, \\mathbf{k}_2)\\) and an ion wave \\((\\omega_1, \\mathbf{k}_1)\\). The parallelogram construction ensures that \\(\\omega_0 = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}_0 = \\mathbf{k}_1 + \\mathbf{k}_2\\). The positions of \\((\\omega_0, \\mathbf{k}_0)\\) and \\((\\omega_2, \\mathbf{k}_2)\\) on the electron curve must be adjusted so that the difference vector lies on the ion curve. Note that an electron wave cannot decay into two other electron waves, because there is no way to make the difference vector lie on the electron curve.\nB shows the parallelogram construction for the “parametric decay” instability. Here, \\((\\omega_0, \\mathbf{k}_0)\\) is an incident electromagnetic wave of large phase velocity \\((\\omega_0/k_0\\approx c)\\). It excites an electron wave and an ion wave moving in opposite directions. Since \\(|\\mathbf{k}_0|\\) is small, we have \\(|\\mathbf{k}_1|\\approx -|\\mathbf{k}_2|\\) and \\(\\omega_0=\\omega_1+\\omega_2\\) for this instability.\nC shows the \\(\\omega-k\\) diagram for the “parametric backscattering” instability, in which a light wave excites an ion wave and another light wave moving in the opposite direction. This can also happen when the ion wave is replaced by a plasma wave. By analogy with similar phenomena in solid state physics, these processes are called, respectively, “stimulated Brillouin scattering” and “stimulated Raman scattering.”\nD represents the two-plasmon decay instability of an electromagnetic wave. Note that the two decay waves are both electron plasma waves, so that frequency matching can occur only if \\(\\omega_0\\simeq 2\\omega_p\\). Expressed in terms of density, this condition is equivalent to \\(n\\simeq n_c/4\\), when \\(n_c\\) is the critical density associated with \\(\\omega_0\\) (\\(n_C = m\\epsilon_0 \\omega_0^2/e^2\\)). This instability can therefore be expected to occur only near the “quarter-critical” layer of an inhomogeneous plasma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.12: Parallelogram constructions showing the \\(\\omega-\\) and \\(k-\\)maching conditions for four parametrix instabilities: (A) electron decay instability, (B) parametric decay instability, (C) stimulated Brillouin backscattering instability, and (D) two-plasmon decay instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4.3 Instability Threshold\nParametric instabilities will occur at any amplitude if there is no damping, but in practice even a small amount of either collisional or Landau damping will prevent the instability unless the pump wave is rather strong. To calculate the threshold, one must introduce the damping rates \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\) of the oscillators \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Equation 17.12 then becomes \\[\n\\ddot{x_1} + \\omega_1^2 x_1 + 2\\Gamma_1 \\dot{x_1} = 0\n\\]\nFor instance, if \\(x_1\\) is the displacement of a spring damped by friction, the last term represents a force proportional to the velocity. If \\(x_1\\) is the electron density in a plasma wave damped by electron–neutral collisions, \\(\\Gamma_1\\) is \\(v_c/2\\) (???) Examination of Equation 17.13, Equation 17.14, and Equation 17.18 will show that it is all right to use exponential notation and let \\(\\mathrm{d}/\\mathrm{d}t \\rightarrow i\\omega\\) for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), as long as we keep \\(E_0\\) real and allow \\(\\bar{x}_1\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_2\\) to be complex. Equation 17.13 and Equation 17.14 become \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\omega_1^2 - \\omega^2 - 2i\\omega\\Gamma_1)x_1(\\omega) &= c_1 x_2 E_0 \\\\\n[\\omega_2^2 - (\\omega-\\omega_0)^2 2i(\\omega-\\omega_0)\\Gamma_2]x_2(\\omega-\\omega_0) &= c_2 x_1 E_0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{17.21}\\]\nWe further restrict ourselves to the simple case of two waves — that is, when \\(\\omega\\simeq\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_0 - \\omega\\simeq\\omega_2\\) but \\(\\omega_0+\\omega\\) is far enough from \\(\\omega_2\\) to be nonresonant — in which case the third row and column of Equation 17.18 can be ignored. If we now express \\(x_1, x_2\\), and \\(E_0\\) in terms of their peak values, as in Equation 17.16, a factor of 1/2 appears on the right-hand sides of Equation 17.21. Discarding the nonresonant terms and eliminating \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) from Equation 17.21, we obtain \\[\n(\\omega^2 - \\omega_1^2 +2i\\omega\\Gamma_1)[(\\omega_0-\\omega)^2 - \\omega_2^2 - 2i(\\omega_0-\\omega)\\Gamma_2] = \\frac{1}{4}c_1c_2\\bar{E}_0^2\n\\]\nAt threshold, we may set \\(\\Im(\\omega)=0\\). The lowest threshold will occur at exact frequency matching; i.e., \\(\\omega=\\omega_1,\\omega_0-\\omega=\\omega_2\\). Then the last equation gives \\[\nc_1c_2(\\bar{E}_0^2)_{\\text{threshold}} = 16\\omega_1\\omega_2\\Gamma_1\\Gamma_2\n\\]\nThe threshold goes to zero with the damping of either wave.\n\n\n17.4.4 Physical Mechanism\nThe parametric excitation of waves can be understood very simply in terms of the ponderomotive force (Section 17.3). As an illustration, consider the case of an electromagnetic wave \\((\\omega_0, \\mathbf{k}_0)\\) driving an electron plasma wave \\((\\omega_2, \\mathbf{k}_2)\\) and a low-frequency ion wave \\((\\omega_1, \\mathbf{k}_1)\\) (fig-parallelogram-construction B). Since \\(\\omega_1\\) is small, \\(\\omega_0\\) must be close to \\(\\omega_p\\). However, the behavior is quite different for \\(\\omega_0&lt;\\omega_p\\) than for \\(\\omega_0&gt;\\omega_p\\). The former case gives rise to the “oscillating two-stream” instability (which will be treated in detail), and the latter to the “parametric decay” instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.13: Physical mechanism of the oscillating two-stream instability.\n\n\n\nSuppose there is a density perturbation in the plasma of the form \\(n_1\\cos k_1 x\\); this perturbation can occur spontaneously as one component of the thermal noise. Let the pump wave have an electric field \\(E_0\\cos\\omega_0 t\\) in the \\(x\\) direction, as shown in Figure 17.13. In the absence of a dc field \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\), the pump wave follows the relation \\(\\omega_0^2 = \\omega_p^2 + c^2k_0^2\\), so that \\(k_0\\approx 0\\) for \\(\\omega_0\\approx\\omega_p\\). We may therefore regard \\(E_0\\) as spatially uniform. If \\(\\omega_0\\) is less than \\(\\omega_p\\) (HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE???), which is the resonant frequency of the cold electron fluid, the electrons will move in the direction opposite to \\(E_0\\), while the ions do not move on the time scale of \\(\\omega_0\\). The density ripple then causes a charge separation, as shown in Figure 17.13. The electrostatic charges create a field \\(E_1\\), which oscillates at the frequency \\(\\omega_0\\). The ponderomotive force due to the total field is given by Equation 17.11: \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{NL} = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\nabla\\frac{\\left&lt; (E_0 + E_1)^2\\right&gt;}{2}\\epsilon_0\n\\]\nSince E0 is uniform and much larger than \\(E_1\\), only the cross term is important: \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{NL} = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\left&lt;2E_0E_1\\right&gt;}{2}\\epsilon_0\n\\]\nThis force does not average to zero, since E1 changes sign with E0. As seen in Figure 17.13, \\(F_{NL}\\) is zero at the peaks and troughs of \\(n_1\\) but is large where \\(\\nabla n_1\\) is large. This spatial distribution causes \\(F_{NL}\\) to push electrons from regions of low density to regions of high density. The resulting de electric field drags the ions along also, and the density perturbation grows. The threshold value of \\(F_{NL}\\) is the value just sufficient to overcome the pressure \\(\\nabla n_{i1}(k_BT_i + k_BT_e)\\), which tends to smooth the density. The density ripple does not propagate, so that \\(\\Re(\\omega_1)=0\\). This is called the oscillating two-stream instability because the sloshing electrons have a time-averaged distribution function which is double-peaked, as in the two-stream instability (Sect. ???).\n\n\n17.4.5 The Oscillating Two-Stream Instability\nI do not understand parametric instability so far. Too hard.\n\n\n17.4.6 The Parametric Decay Instability",

    "text": "17.6 Nonlinear Landau Damping\nWhen the amplitude of an electron or ion wave excited, say, by a grid is followed in space, it is often found that the decay is not exponential, as predicted by linear theory, if the amplitude is large. Instead, one typically finds that the amplitude decays, grows again, and then oscillates before settling down to a steady value. Although other effects may also be operative, these oscillations in amplitude are exactly what would be expected from the nonlinear effect of particle trapping discussed in Section 12.6.",

    "text": "18.2 MHD\nNunov highly recommended a review (Schekochihin 2022). Another nice reference for the solar wind turbulence is presented (Bruno and Carbone 2013), where I cite many materials in this note.\nMagnetohydrodynamic turbulence concerns the chaotic regimes of magnetofluid flow at high Reynolds number. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) deals with what is a quasi-neutral fluid with very high conductivity. The fluid approximation implies that the focus is on macro length-and-time scales which are much larger than the collision length and collision time respectively.\nThe guide magnetic field in turbulence is usually considered as the steady state background field. It can either be imposed by external sources, or created by large-scale eddies.\n\n18.2.1 Comparison with Hydrodynamics\n\nHD turbulence: interaction of eddies.\nMHD turbulence: interaction of wave packets moving with Alfvén velocities.\n\n\n\n18.2.2 Incompressible MHD equations\nIn the context of studying turbulence, the most commonly used math tool is the incompressible MHD equations. Incompressibility means \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0\\), but not necessarily constant density. Physically it means infinite sound speed \\(V_s \\sim \\sqrt{\\delta p / \\delta \\rho}\\to \\infty\\), i.e. the density will not change no matter how large the pressure variation is. In many scenarios, assuming constant density is good enough and lead to further simplification of math.1\nThe incompressible MHD equations for constant mass density, \\(\\rho=1\\), are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} &= -\\nabla P + \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B} + \\nu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{B} &= \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + \\eta\\nabla^2\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} &= 0 \\\\\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.1}\\] where \\(P\\) is the total (thermal + magnetic) pressure, \\(\\nu\\) is the kinematic viscosity, and \\(\\eta\\) is the magnetic diffusivity. In the above equation, the magnetic field is in Alfvén units (same as velocity units).\nThe total magnetic field can be split into a mean field and a fluctuating field: \\[\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}_0 + \\delta\\mathbf{b}\n\\]\nWe can then obtain the magnetic field equation for the perturbation term only: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{b}}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{v}_A\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u}\n\\]\nIf the Hall effect is considered, then there will be additional terms in the magnetic field equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{b}}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{v}_A\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + d_i\\nabla\\times\\left[ \\mathbf{v}_A\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{b}) \\right] + d_i\\nabla\\times\\left[ \\mathbf{b}\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{b}) \\right] + \\eta \\nabla^2\\mathbf{b}\n\\tag{18.2}\\]\nNote that here \\(\\delta\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) may be used interchangably.\n\n\n18.2.3 Coupling between charged fluid and magnetic field\nElsässer variables are used to extract the Alfvénic component from MHD. They are defined as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{z}^+ &= \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{b} \\\\\n\\mathbf{z}^- &= \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{b}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.3}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{B}/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\rho}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{B}/\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho}\\) in CGS units.\nThe perturbations in Elsässer form are written as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta\\mathbf{z}^+ &= \\delta\\mathbf{v} + \\delta\\mathbf{b} \\\\\n\\delta\\mathbf{z}^- &= \\delta\\mathbf{v} - \\delta\\mathbf{b}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\(\\mathbf{z}^\\pm\\) corresponds to anti-parallel/parallel propagating modes:\n\nParallel wave: \\(\\delta\\mathbf{v}=-\\delta\\mathbf{b}\\Rightarrow \\delta\\mathbf{z}^+=0, \\delta\\mathbf{z}^-=2\\delta\\mathbf{v}\\)\nAnti-parallel wave: \\(\\delta\\mathbf{v}=\\delta\\mathbf{b}\\Rightarrow \\delta\\mathbf{z}^+=2\\delta\\mathbf{v}, \\delta\\mathbf{z}^-=0\\)\n\nThe Alfvénicity condition \\[\n\\delta\\mathbf{v}=\\pm\\delta\\mathbf{b}=\\pm\\delta\\mathbf{B}/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\rho_0}\n\\tag{18.4}\\] often appears in the context of discussing Alfvén waves.\nThe incompressible MHD wave equation in fluctuating Elsässer form is: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm}{\\partial t} \\mp \\mathbf{v}_A\\cdot\\nabla_\\parallel\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm + \\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\mp\\cdot\\nabla\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm = -\\nabla p + \\nu_+ \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{z}^{\\pm} + \\nu_- \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{z}^{\\mp}\n\\tag{18.5}\\] where \\(\\nu _{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\nu \\pm \\eta)\\). The incompressibility and divergence-free B condition are written as \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm = 0\n\\tag{18.6}\\]\nThe zero divergence means that there are no forcing or dissipation terms. Since we have already assumed uniform density in Equation 18.1, \\(v_A = B_0 / \\rho = B_0\\), we can write Equation 18.5 in an alternative form \\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm}{\\partial t} \\mp \\mathbf{B}_0\\cdot\\nabla_\\parallel\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm + \\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\mp\\cdot\\nabla\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm = -\\nabla p + \\nu_+ \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{z}^{\\pm} + \\nu_- \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{z}^{\\mp}\n\\tag{18.7}\\]\nEquation 18.5 unveils the interesting phenonmena in Alfvénic turbulence study. The second term on the left-hand side is a linear term that represents propagation of waves parallel to the mean field. The third term represent the non-linear interaction of counter-propagating waves, during which energy is transferred to smaller scales. This is exactly turbulence. In MHD, turbulence is manifested by the collision of Alfvén waves.\nUsing the linear perturbation theory, \\(\\mp \\mathbf{v}_A\\cdot\\nabla_\\parallel\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm\\) scales as \\((k_\\parallel v_A)z^\\pm\\), and \\(\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\mp\\cdot\\nabla\\delta\\mathbf{z}^\\pm\\) scales as \\((k_\\perp z^\\mp)z^\\pm\\). When \\(k_\\parallel v_A \\gg k_\\perp z^\\mp\\), the turbulence is weak; when \\(k_\\parallel v_A \\simeq k_\\perp z^\\mp\\), the turbulence is strong. Assuming an energy supply at small k, then first in the weak MHD turbulence the energy \\(E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-2}\\), and later in the strong MHD turbulence \\(E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-3/2}\\). At larger k, eventually we will encounter the dissipation scale, where the slope changes sharply because of the balance/imbalance of the energy cascade of the interacting waves.\n\n\n18.2.4 Wave Interaction Phenomenology\nThe simplest three-wave interaction of shear-Alfvén waves is given as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega(k) &= \\omega(k_1) + \\omega(k_2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k} &= \\mathbf{k}_1 + \\mathbf{k}_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.8}\\] where \\[\n\\omega(k) = |k_z|v_A\n\\]\nThe total wave number k is composed of two parts: \\(k_z\\) is the wave number along the guide field direction, and \\(k_\\perp\\) is the wave number perpendicular to the guide field. Since only counter-propagating waves interact, \\(k_{1z}\\) and \\(k_{2z}\\) should have opposite signs. In order to satisfy the interaction condition, we can have either \\(k_{1z} = 0\\) or \\(k_{2z} = 0\\). That means wave interactions change \\(k_\\perp\\) but not \\(k_z\\).\n\n\n18.2.5 Nondimensional parameters\nThe important nondimensional parameters for MHD are\n\nReynolds number: \\(\\text{Re}=UL/\\nu\\)\nMagnetic Reynolds number: \\(\\text{Re}_{M}=UL/\\eta\\)\nMagnetic Prandtl number: \\(P_{M}=\\nu/\\eta\\)\n\nThe magnetic Prandtl number is an important property of the fluid. Liquid metals have small magnetic Prandtl numbers, for example, liquid sodium’s $P_{M} is around \\(10^{-5}\\). But plasmas have large \\(P_{M}\\).\nThe Reynolds number is the ratio of the nonlinear term \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\) of the Navier–Stokes equation to the viscous term. While the magnetic Reynolds number is the ratio of the nonlinear term and the diffusive term of the induction equation.\nIn many practical situations, the Reynolds number Re of the flow is quite large. For such flows typically the velocity and the magnetic fields are random. Such flows are called to exhibit MHD turbulence. Note that \\(\\text{Re}_{M}\\) need not be large for MHD turbulence. \\(\\text{Re}_{M}\\) plays an important role in dynamo (magnetic field generation) problem.\nThe mean magnetic field plays an important role in MHD turbulence, for example it can make the turbulence anisotropic; suppress the turbulence by decreasing energy cascade etc. The earlier MHD turbulence models assumed isotropy of turbulence, while the later models have studied anisotropic aspects.\n\n\n18.2.6 Critical balance\nIf we match the Alfvén (linear) timescale, \\(\\tau_A \\sim l_\\parallel/v_A\\) (related to how fast Alfvén waves propagate along magnetic field lines), with the nonlinear timescale, \\(\\tau_{nl}\\sim l_\\perp/\\delta z\\) (related to how fast turbulent eddies interact and distort each other), \\[\n\\tau_A = \\tau_{nl}\n\\] we have a way to predict the scaling of energy distribution across different scales, and the relationship between perpendicular and parallel structures in turbulence. This is known as the critical balance (Goldreich and Sridhar).\nAssume a constant energy cascade rate \\(\\epsilon\\sim \\delta z^2/\\tau_{nl}\\), and an energy injection rate at scale L \\(\\epsilon_L\\sim v_A^2/\\tau_{nl}=v_A^3/L\\). When we match the two rates and … (I have some memory from Nunov’s lecture at Nordita), we have \\[\nk_\\parallel\\propto k_\\perp^{2/3}\n\\tag{18.9}\\] This means that anisotropy grows with decreasing scale. It indicates the transition from “weak” to “strong” turbulence, or more accurately a transition from “quasi-linear” to “mode-coupling” processes.2 The power spectra are given as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(k_\\perp) &\\propto k_\\perp^{-5/3} \\\\\nE(k_\\parallel) &\\propto k_\\parallel^{-2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.10}\\]\nThis is among the most influential discoveries related to MHD turbulence, which makes it distinct from gas dynamic Kolmogorov turbulence by taking the magnetic field into account. By separating \\(k_\\parallel\\) and \\(k_\\perp\\) dynamics, the critical balance theory predicts perpendicular energy spectra Equation 18.10, which is consistent with the solar wind turbulence in the inertial range [Chen 2016]. The theory invoking this concept is now known as the anisotropic MHD turbulence.\nHowever, why this is the case in nature is still under debate.\n\n\n18.2.7 Residual energy\nResidual energy is the difference in energy between magnetic and velocity fluctuations. The normalized residual energy is \\[\n\\sigma_r = \\frac{|\\delta\\mathbf{v}|^2 - |\\delta\\mathbf{b}|^2}{|\\delta\\mathbf{v}|^2 + |\\delta\\mathbf{b}|^2}\n\\tag{18.11}\\]\n\\(\\sigma_r\\) is zero for an Alfvén wave but is generally negative (\\(|\\delta\\mathbf{b}|^2 &gt; |\\delta\\mathbf{v}|^2\\)) at MHD scales for solar wind observations, meaning that they are mostly likely turbulence but not waves.\nWeak MHD turbulence spontaneously generates a condensate of the residual energy \\(E_r = E_b - E_k\\) at small \\(k_\\parallel\\). Condensate broadens with \\(k_\\perp\\).\nFor Strong MHD turbulence, the residual energy is nonzero at all k.\n\n\n18.2.8 Normalized cross helicity\nCross helicity is the difference in energy between \\(\\mathbf{z}^+\\) and \\(\\mathbf{z}^-\\) fluctuations (Section 19.5). The normalized cross helicity is \\[\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{|\\delta\\mathbf{z}^+|^2 - |\\delta\\mathbf{z}^-|^2}{|\\delta\\mathbf{z}^+|^2 - |\\delta\\mathbf{z}^-|^2} = \\frac{2\\delta\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{b}}{|\\delta\\mathbf{v}|^2 + |\\delta\\mathbf{b}|^2}\n\\tag{18.12}\\]\n\n\\(|\\sigma_c|=1\\): unidirectional Alfvén waves (no turbulence)\n\\(|\\sigma_c|\\lesssim 1\\): imbalanced turbulence\n\\(|\\sigma_c|=0\\): balanced turbulence (or non-Alfvénic fluctuations)\n\nThe solar wind is typically imbalanced towards the anti-sunward direction. From Equation 18.11 and Equation 18.12 we can easily see that \\[\n\\sqrt{\\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_c^2} \\le 1\n\\]\nThe observed distribution is shown in Figure 18.1. Note, however, \\(\\sigma_r\\) depends on how you evaluate \\(\\delta{b}\\). In the MHD case \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{B}/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\rho}\\) is used, but in the kinetic case there will be an extra coefficient. The results look pretty different!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: Solar wind normalized residual energy and cross helicity statistics from Chen+ 2013.\n\n\n\nObservation from 1 AU (WIND) show that the non-Alfvénic wind typically has small alpha-proton relative drift and nearly equal temperatures of both ionic components. In terms of occurrence, there is no significant difference for a typical solar wind speed of 300 km/s, but for high speed solar wind there is a higher probability for large \\(|\\sigma_c|\\) of being Alfvénic.\n\nNon-Alfvénic solar winds\n\nslower and lower in abundance, \\(n_\\alpha/n_p &lt; 4%\\)\n\\(v_p - v_\\alpha \\sim 0\\)\n\\(T_p \\sim T_\\alpha\\)\ncould be formed by the interchange-recnnection near the Sun\n\nAlfvénic solar winds\n\n\\(n_{\\mathrm{He}}/n_{\\mathrm{p}}\\sim 4%\\) and does not depend on the proton velocity\nalpha particles are about 4 times hotter than protons.\noriginates from the coronal holes",

The measures \\(D_1\\), \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\) describing the one-, two- or three-dimensionality of the magnetic field and are obtained from the ratios of square roots of the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_i\\) (\\(i=1,2,3\\), in descending order) of the MDD \\(\\overleftrightarrow{G}\\overleftrightarrow{G}^\\intercal\\).\nOne kind of definitions for \\(D_1\\), \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\) are given below: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n   D_1 &= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1}-\\sqrt{\\lambda_2}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1}}\\\\\n   D_2 &= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda_2}-\\sqrt{\\lambda_3}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1}}\\\\\n   D_3 &= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda_3}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] These quantities are defined to lie in the range [0,1] and their sum is one.

For example, the current sheet with dimensionality 1, MGA obtains the field-aligned direction (above and below the current sheet), while MDD obtains the normal direction to the current sheet, with two other directions being ambiguous.1\nCommon representative structure:\n\n1D: current sheet\n2D: plasmoid, flux rope\n3D: rare2",

It works decently on steady reconnection cases, but not when things change drastically.\n\n\n19.2.3 Critical Points\nLet us discuss the problem with topological definitions (following Kenneth Rohde Christiansen and Aard Keimpema). Critical points are points where the vector vanishes (i.e. \\(\\mathbf{v}=0\\)). More rigidly speaking, critical points are stationary points that have a non-singular (i.e. no zero eigenvalues) Jacobian or vector gradient \\(\\nabla\\mathbf{v}\\). There are 6 different types of critical points, characterized by the behavior of nearby tangent curves. The position of these critical points can be found by searching all cells in the flow field. Critical points only occur in cells whree all components of the vector pass through zero. In order to find the exact location of the critical point we will have to do interpolations.\nWe can then classify these by looking at the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix for a 2D vector \\((u,v)\\) is given by \\[\n\\frac{\\partial(u,v)}{\\partial(x,y)}\\Bigg\\rvert_{x_0, y_0} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_x u & \\partial_y u \\\\ \\partial_x v & \\partial_y v\n\\end{pmatrix}\\Bigg\\rvert_{x_0, y_0}\n\\tag{19.1}\\]\nAs seen in Figure 19.4 these 6 different types are classified by the sign of the real and imaginary part of the eigenvalues. The real part of the eigenvalue gives rise to an attraction (if \\(RE &lt; 0\\)) or a repulsion (if \\(RE &gt; 0\\)). The imaginary part of the eigenvalue give rise to a rotation of vector field around the critical point. When we have an imaginary eigenvalue we are left with an entirely rotational vector field around the critical point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.4: Classification of critical points, here Re1/Re2 is the real part of the first/second eigenvalue and Im1/Im2 is the imaginary part of the first/second eigenvalue.\n\n\n\nThe most important critical point is the saddle point here we have a combination of attraction in one direction and repulsion in the other. The importance of saddle points as we shall see in the next section is that the tangent curves near a critical point determine the global structure of the flow.\nA critical point is called hyperbolic if it does not have any eigenvalues with zero real part. Hyperbolic critical points are structurally stable, i.e., a small perturbation does not change their topology.\nBesides critical points there are also so-called attachment/detachment nodes. These are points on the wall of an object where tangent curves terminate or begin.\nIn 3D, the most common (i.e., nondegenerate) types of critical points are sources, sinks, repelling saddles, and attracting saddles, visualized in Figure 19.5 ((Bujack et al. 2021)). Each of these types may imply a rotating pattern in a certain plane depending on the presence of eigenvalues with nonzero imaginary part. This gives rise to the eight cases shown in the figure. A 2D separatrix and two 1D separatrices originate or terminate at a saddle (if the 2D separatrix originates at the saddle, then the 1D separatrices terminate at the saddle, and vice-versa). The directions along which the separatrices approach the saddle are given by the eigenvectors of \\(\\nabla v\\). The 1D separatrices are computed by placing two seeds at a small user-defined offset of the saddle in the direction of the eigenvectors of \\(\\nabla v\\) corresponding to the eigenvalue whose sign appears only once. The trajectories from these seeds are integrated as explained above. The 2D separatrix is computed by placing eight seeds at a small user-defined offset of the saddle in the plane spanned by the eigenvectors of ∇v corresponding to the eigenvalues whose signs appear twice. These seeds are the base for integrating a surface — the separatrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.5: The different types of nondegenerate 3D critical points visualized with streamlines color coded in red/blue for forward/backward integration and line integral convolution in the plane of the common sign. Here the presence of the subscript \\(i\\) means all \\(i \\in (1, 2, 3)\\), and the order of the eigenvalues does not matter.\n\n\n\nThe most important input parameters are the distance in which the separatrices are seeded away from the saddles and the parameters that are handed off to the streamline and streamsurface integrators, like step sizes and maximum number of steps.\n\n\n19.2.4 Separatrix\nIn scientific visualization, we treat vector fields defined on a discrete set of points in a grid and interpolate linearly or multilinearly within the cells. Since piecewise linear or multilinear functions are Lipschitz continuous, streamlines always exist uniquely.\nA skeleton of a flow field is a figure containing the critical points of the flow field and the so-called integral curves connecting them. An integral curve can be thought of as the path a test particle takes when released infinitesimally close to a critical point. By adding e.g. an arrow the direction of the integral curves can be displayed; giving a global image of the flow. In the topology context, the skeleton is known as the separatrix. Separatrices are solutions which differ from their neighbors in their limit sets (?) or in their behavior in the large (?). Separatrices include critical points, periodic orbits, and invariant manifolds of saddles.\nIn practice, separatrices are constructed by\n\nDetecting critical points analytically in each cell\nClassifying them based on the eigenvalues of their Jacobian\nSeeding separatrices in a small offset of the saddles in the direction of their eigenvectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.6: Identification of separatrices in 2D.\n\n\n\nIn 3D, instead of lines we may have separatrix surfaces.",

Helicity is a pseudo-scalar quantity: it changes sign under change from a right-handed to a left-handed frame of reference; it can be considered as a measure of the handedness (or chirality) of the flow. Helicity is one of the four known integral invariants of the Euler equations; the other three are energy, momentum and angular momentum.\nThe invariance of helicity provides an essential cornerstone of the subject topological fluid dynamics and MHD, which is concerned with global properties of flows and their topological characteristics.",

    "text": "19.4 Magnetic Helicity\nThe helicity of a smooth vector field defined on a domain in 3D space is the standard measure of the extent to which the field lines wrap and coil around one another. As to magnetic helicity, this “vector field” is magnetic field. It is a generalization of the topological concept of linking number to the differential quantities required to describe the magnetic field. As with many quantities in electromagnetism, magnetic helicity (which describes magnetic field lines) is closely related to fluid mechanical helicity (which describes fluid flow lines).\nIf magnetic field lines follow the strands of a twisted rope, this configuration would have nonzero magnetic helicity; left-handed ropes would have negative values and right-handed ropes would have positive values.\nFormally, \\[\nH=\\int\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}^3\n\\tag{19.3}\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(H\\) is the helicity of the entire magnetic field\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the magnetic field strength\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the vector potential of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}\\)\n\nMagnetic helicity has units of \\(\\text{Wb}^2\\) in SI units and \\(\\text{Mx}^2\\) in Gaussian Units. Note that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\) should not be considered as “helicity density” because of gauge freedom.\nIt is a conserved quantity in electromagnetic fields, even when magnetic reconnection dissipates energy (Woltjer 1958). The concept is useful in solar dynamics and in dynamo theory. Helicity is approximately conserved during magnetic reconnection and topology changes. Helicity can be injected into a system such as the solar corona. When too much builds up, it ends up being expelled through coronal mass ejections. The simple proof in ideal MHD can be found on Wikipedia.\nMagnetic helicity is a gauge-dependent quantity, because \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) can be redefined by adding a gradient to it (gauge transformation): \\[\n\\mathbf{A}^\\prime = \\mathbf{A} + \\nabla\\phi\n\\]\nHowever, for perfectly conducting boundaries or periodic systems without a net magnetic flux, the magnetic helicity is gauge invariant. A gauge-invariant relative helicity has been defined for volumes with non-zero magnetic flux on their boundary surfaces. If the magnetic field is turbulent and weakly inhomogeneous a magnetic helicity density and its associated flux can be defined in terms of the density of field line linkages.\nThe topological properties of a magnetic field are interpreted in terms of magnetic helicity. The total helicity of a collection of flux tubes arises from the linking of flux tubes with one another (mutual helicity) and the internal magnetic structure of each flux tube (self-helicity). Reconnection changes the topology and magnetic connectivity of flux tubes. This can also be viewed as a redistribution of self- and mutual helicities. If total magnetic helicity is approximately conserved, it is possible to put quantitative limits upon the changes in self- and mutual helicities. This can be interpreted as the change in magnetic flux tube linkage (due to reconnection) and amount of twist present in the reconnected flux tubes. [Wright & Berger, 1989]\nSimple examples:\n\nA single untwisted closed flux loop has \\(H=0\\).\nA single flux rope with a magnetic flux of \\(\\phi\\) that twists around itself \\(T\\) times has a helicity of \\(H = T\\phi^2\\).\nTwo interlinked untwisted flux loops with fluxes \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\phi_2\\) have \\(H=\\pm2\\phi_1\\phi_2\\) where the sign depends on the sense of the linkedness.\n\nThere are generalizations to allow for gauge-invariant definitions of helicity. [Berger & Field (1984)] defined the relative magnetic helicity to be \\[\nH = \\int_V \\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{A}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0 dV\n\\tag{19.4}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{B}_0=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}_0\\) is the potential field inside \\(V\\) with the same field outside of \\(V\\) (see also Finn & Antonsen 1985).\nIn toroidal laboratory experiments, it is natural to consider the volume contained within conducting wall boundaries that are coincident with closed flux surfaces (i.e., the magnetic field along the wall is parallel to the boundary).\nThe time evolution of magnetic helicity is given by \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2c\\int_V \\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}dV + 2c\\int_S \\mathbf{A}_p\\times\\mathbf{E}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}\n\\] where we choose \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}_p=0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}_p\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}=0\\) on \\(S\\). The first term represents helicity dissipation when \\(E_\\parallel\\neq 0\\), which is always zero in ideal MHD. The second term represents helicity fluxes in and out of the system, for example, flux emergence from the solar photosphere corresponds to helicity injection in the corona.",

The radial momentum conservation equation for the corona takes the form \\[\n\\rho\\,u\\,\\frac{du}{\\mathrm{d}r} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}r} - \\rho\\,\\frac{G\\,M_\\odot}{r^2}\n\\tag{20.5}\\] where \\(u\\) is the radial expansion speed. The continuity equation reduces to \\[\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(r^2\\,\\rho\\,u)}{\\mathrm{d}r} = 0\n\\tag{20.6}\\]\nIn order to obtain a closed set of equations, we now need to adopt an equation of state for the corona, relating the pressure, \\(p\\), and the density, \\(\\rho\\). For the sake of simplicity, we adopt the simplest conceivable equation of state, which corresponds to an isothermal corona. Thus, we have \\[\np = \\frac{2k_B\\rho T}{m_p}\n\\tag{20.7}\\] where \\(T\\) is a constant. Note that more realistic equations of state complicate the analysis, but do not significantly modify any of the physics results.\nEquation 20.6 can be integrated to give \\[\nr^2\\,\\rho\\,u = I\n\\tag{20.8}\\] where \\(I\\) is a constant. The above expression simply states that the mass flux per unit solid angle, which takes the value \\(I\\), is independent of the radius, \\(r\\). Equation 20.5, Equation 20.7, and Equation 20.8 can be combined together to give \\[\n\\frac{1}{u} \\,\\frac{du}{\\mathrm{d}r}\\left(u^2 - \\frac{2k_B T}{m_p}\\right) = \\frac{4k_B T}{m_p\\,r} - \\frac{G\\,M_\\odot}{r^2}\n\\tag{20.9}\\]\nLet us restrict our attention to coronal temperatures which satisfy \\[\nT &lt; T_c \\equiv \\frac{G\\,M_\\odot\\,m_p}{4k_B\\,a}\n\\] where \\(a\\) is the radius of the base of the corona. \\(T_c\\) is the defined temperature where the right-hand side of Equation 20.9 is zero at \\(r=a\\). For typical coronal parameters (see previous section), \\(T_c\\simeq 5.8\\times 10^6\\)K, which is certainly greater than the temperature of the corona at \\(r=a\\). For \\(T&lt;T_c\\), the right-hand side of Equation 20.9 is negative for \\(a&lt;r&lt;r_c\\), where (???) \\[\n\\frac{r_c}{a} = \\frac{T_c}{T}\n\\tag{20.10}\\] and positive for \\(r_c&lt;r&lt;\\infty\\). The right-hand side of Equation 20.9 is zero at \\(r=r_c\\), implying that the left-hand side is also zero at this radius, which is usually termed the “critical radius”. There are two ways in which the left-hand side of Equation 20.9 can be zero at the critical radius. Either \\[\nu^2(r_c) = u_c^2 \\equiv \\frac{2k_B T}{m_p}\n\\tag{20.11}\\] or \\[\n\\frac{du(r_c)}{\\mathrm{d}r} = 0\n\\tag{20.12}\\]\nNote that \\(u_c\\) is the coronal sound speed.\nAs is easily demonstrated, if Equation 20.11 is satisfied then \\(du/\\mathrm{d}r\\) has the same sign for all \\(r\\), and \\(u(r)\\) is either a monotonically increasing, or a monotonically decreasing, function of \\(r\\). On the other hand, if Equation 20.12 is satisfied then \\(u^2-u_c^2\\) has the same sign for all \\(r\\), and \\(u(r)\\) has an extremum close to \\(r=r_c\\). The flow is either super-sonic for all \\(r\\), or sub-sonic for all \\(r\\). These possibilities lead to the existence of four classes of solutions to Equation 20.9, with the following properties:\nThese four classes of solutions are illustrated in Figure 20.1.\nEach of the classes of solutions described above fits a different set of boundary conditions at \\(r=a\\) and \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). The physical acceptability of these solutions depends on these boundary conditions. For example, both Class 3 and Class 4 solutions can be ruled out as plausible models for the solar corona since they predict super-sonic flow at the base of the corona, which is not observed, and is also not consistent with a static solar photosphere. Class 1 and Class 2 solutions remain acceptable models for the solar corona on the basis of their properties around \\(r=a\\), since they both predict sub-sonic flow in this region. However, the Class 1 and Class 2 solutions behave quite differently as \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\), and the physical acceptability of these two classes hinges on this difference.\nEquation 20.9 can be rearranged to give \\[\n\\frac{du^2}{\\mathrm{d}r}\\left(1-\\frac{u_c^{~2}}{u^2}\\right) = \\frac{4\\,u_c^{~2}}{r} \\left(1-\\frac{r_c}{r}\\right)\n\\] where Equation 20.10 and the definition of \\(T_c\\) have been used. The above expression can be integrated to give \\[\n\\left(\\frac{u}{u_c}\\right)^2 -\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{u}{u_c}\\right)^2 = 4\\,\\ln\\frac{r}{r_c} + 4\\,\\frac{r_c}{r} + C\n\\tag{20.13}\\] where \\(C\\) is a constant of integration.\nLet us consider the behaviour of Class 1 solutions in the limit \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). It is clear from Figure 20.1 that, for Class 1 solutions, \\(u/u_c\\) is less than unity and monotonically decreasing as \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). In the large-\\(r\\) limit, Equation 20.13 reduces to \\[\n\\ln\\frac{u}{u_c} \\simeq -2\\,\\ln\\frac{r}{r_c}\n\\] so that \\[\nu\\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}\n\\]\nIt follows from Equation 20.8 that the coronal density, \\(\\rho\\), approaches a finite, constant value, \\(\\rho_\\infty\\), as \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). Thus, the Class 1 solutions yield a finite pressure, \\[\np_\\infty= \\frac{2k_B\\,\\rho_\\infty\\,T}{m_p}\n\\] at large \\(r\\), which cannot be matched to the much smaller pressure of the interstellar medium. Clearly, Class 1 solutions are unphysical.\nLet us consider the behaviour of the Class 2 solution in the limit \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). It is clear from Figure 20.1 that, for the Class 2 solution, \\(u/u_c\\) is greater than unity and monotonically increasing as \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). In the large-\\(r\\) limit, Equation 20.13 reduces to \\[\n\\left(\\frac{u}{u_c}\\right)^2 \\simeq 4\\,\\ln\\frac{r}{r_c}\n\\] so that \\[\nu \\simeq 2\\,u_c\\,\\left(\\ln\\frac{r}{r_c}\\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\nIt follows from Equation 20.8 that \\(\\rho\\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\). Thus, the Class 2 solution yields \\(p\\rightarrow 0\\) at large \\(r\\), and can, therefore, be matched to the low pressure interstellar medium.\nWe conclude that the only solution to Equation 20.9 which is consistent with physical boundary conditions at \\(r=a\\) and \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\) is the Class 2 solution. This solution predicts that the solar corona expands radially outward at relatively modest, sub-sonic velocities close to the Sun, and gradually accelerates to super-sonic velocities as it moves further away from the Sun. Parker termed this continuous, super-sonic expansion of the corona the solar wind.\nNote that while the velocity prediction accords well with satellite observations, the Parker model’s prediction for the density of the solar wind at the Earth is significantly too high compared to satellite observations. Consequently, there have been many further developments of this model. In particular, the unrealistic assumption that the solar wind plasma is isothermal has been relaxed, and two-fluid effects have been incorporated into the analysis.",

Near the solar equator the mean field magnitude declines with \\[\nB_r(r) \\simeq B_r(r_0)\\Big( \\frac{r_0}{r} \\Big)^2\n\\] and \\[\nB_\\phi(r) \\simeq \\frac{\\Omega_r}{u(r)}B_r(r)\n\\]\nfrom the Parker spiral solar wind model and \\(\\Omega_r = 2.94\\times 10^{-6}\\) rad/s being the angular frequency of the rotation of the sun.\nThe adiabatic equation in the perpendicular direction indicates that the perpendicular thermal energy \\(\\langle m v_\\perp^2/2\\rangle = k_B T_\\perp\\) declines with B. Assuming in the rest frame the distribution function is a bi-Maxwellian of the form \\[\nf(v) = \\Big( \\frac{m}{2\\pi}  \\Big)^{3/2}\\frac{1}{k_B T_\\perp (k_B T_\\parallel)^{1/2}} \\exp\\Big( -\\frac{mv_\\perp^2}{2k_B T_\\perp} -\\frac{mv_\\parallel^2}{2k_B T_\\parallel} \\Big)\n\\]\nThe conservation of the total thermal energy \\[\nW = \\int \\mathrm{d}^3v \\frac{mv^2}{2}f(v)\n\\] yields \\[\nW = k_B T_\\perp + k_B T_\\parallel/2 = \\text{const}.\n\\]\nThese allows us to evaluate the variations in \\(T_\\perp\\) and \\(T_\\parallel\\) originating from isotropic distribution on the surface of the sun.

Therefore, in fact, the reasonable question to ask is why the actual solar wind anisotropy factor is so small. In simulations, we always apply isotropic distribution in the upstream solar wind condition, which is primarily due to the fact that we are mostly using fluid models (i.e. MHD) for global magnetosphere-solar wind interactions. For kinetic models, we need more realistic distribution setups.\nWell, we know now when pressure anisotropy develops, two kinds of plasma instabilities can be triggered: firehose when \\(T_\\perp &lt; T_\\parallel\\) and mirror when \\(T_\\perp &gt; T_\\parallel\\). Further studies require kinetic theory to describe their behaviors.\nOn the other hand, the opposite case, \\(T_\\perp &gt; T_\\parallel\\), is also observed and believed to be related to local ion heating by macroscale compressions (e.g. high/low speed streams interaction) or plasma instabilities (Bame et al. 1975).\nThe mirror instability criterion as an additional relation to determine the pressure anisotropy downstream of the shock from the book Plasma instabilities and nonlinear effects by Hasegawa 1975, \\[\n1 + \\sum_{\\textrm{species}} \\beta_\\perp \\big( 1 - \\frac{\\beta_\\perp}{\\beta_\\parallel} \\big) &lt; 0\n\\]",

In the 1990s, with the launch of the Ulysses spacecraft, investigations have been extended to the high-latitude regions of the heliosphere.\nRuelle and Takens (1971) who showed that a strange attractor in the phase space of the system is the best model for the birth of turbulence. This gave a strong impulse to the investigation of the phenomenology of turbulence from the point of view of dynamical systems. Turbulence in the solar wind has been used as a big wind tunnel to investigate scaling laws of turbulent fluctuations, multifractals models, etc. Therefore, the solar wind can be seen as a very big laboratory where fully developed turbulence can be investigated not only per se, rather as far as basic theoretical aspects are concerned.",

The low collisionality of the solar wind allows for nonthermal features to survive, which suggests the requirement of a kinetic plasma description.\nThe role of kinetic slow waves (KSWs) have largely been ignored as it is heavily damped for the typical plasma parameters of the solar wind (Barnes, 1966; Narita & Marsch, 2015).

For a 1D shock, suppose that the shock front coincides with the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane. Furthermore, let the regions of the plasma upstream and downstream of the shock, which are termed regions 1 and 2, respectively, be spatially uniform and time-static, i.e. \\(\\partial/\\partial t = \\partial/\\partial y = \\partial/\\partial z = 0\\). Moreover, \\(\\partial/\\partial x=0\\), except in the immediate vicinity of the shock. Finally, let the velocity and magnetic fields upstream and downstream of the shock all lie in the x-y plane. The situation under discussion is illustrated in the figure below.\nHere, \\(\\rho_1\\), \\(p_1\\), \\(\\mathbf{U}_1\\), and \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) are the downstream mass density, pressure, velocity, and magnetic field, respectively, whereas \\(\\rho_2\\), \\(p_2\\), \\(\\mathbf{U}_2\\), and \\(\\mathbf{B}_2\\) are the corresponding upstream quantities.1\nThe basic RH relations are listed in MHD shocks. In the immediate vicinity of the planar shock, Equation 21.1 reduce to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{x}}{\\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}(U_x\\,B_y-U_y\\,B_x)=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} (\\rho\\, U_x)}{\\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S_{xx}}{\\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S_{xy}}{\\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} w_x}{\\mathrm{d}x}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIntegration across the shock yields the desired jump conditions: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor B_x\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor U_x\\,B_y-U_y\\,B_x\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho\\,U_x\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho\\,U_x^{\\,2}+p + B_y^{\\,2}/2\\mu_0\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho\\,U_x\\,U_y - B_x\\,B_y/\\mu_0\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\Big\\lfloor \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho\\,U^2\\,U_x + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\,p\\,U_x + \\frac{B_y\\,(U_x\\,B_y-U_y\\,B_x)}{\\mu_0}\\Big\\rceil=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.5}\\] where \\(\\lfloor A \\rceil = A_2 - A_1\\) is the difference across the shock. These relations are often called the Rankine-Hugoniot relations for MHD. There are 6 scalar equations and 12 (6 upstream and 6 downstream) scalar variables all together. Assuming that all of the upstream plasma parameters are known, there are 6 unknown parameters in the problem–namely, \\(B_{x\\,2}\\), \\(B_{y\\,2}\\), \\(U_{x\\,2}\\), \\(U_{y\\,2}\\), \\(\\rho_2\\), and \\(p_2\\). These 6 unknowns are fully determined by the six jump conditions. If we loose the planar assumption, then we typically write the \\(x\\)-component as the normal component (\\(U_n, B_n\\)) and the combined y- and z-components as the tangential component (\\(U_t,B_t\\)): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor B_n\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor U_n\\,B_t-U_t\\,B_n\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho\\,U_n\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho\\,U_n^{\\,2}+p + B_t^{\\,2}/2\\mu_0\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho\\,U_n\\,U_t - B_n\\,B_t/\\mu_0\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\Big\\lfloor \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho\\,U^2\\,U_n + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\,p\\,U_n + \\frac{B_t\\,(U_n\\,B_t-U_t\\,B_n)}{\\mu_0}\\Big\\rceil=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.6}\\]\nLuckily this is still deterministic. However, as you can see later, the general case is very complicated.\nA clear exposition of the two types of strong discontinuities, namely the shock wave and the tangential discontinuity can be found in §84, Landau & Lifshitz. By definition\nMathematically, let the shock plane speed be \\(U_s\\), then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor\\rho (U_x - U_s)\\rceil&\\neq 0\\quad \\text{for shock} \\\\\n\\lfloor\\rho (U_x - U_s)\\rceil&=0\\quad \\text{for discontinuity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.7}\\]\nThus in shocks \\(\\lfloor U_n \\rceil \\neq 0\\), and in discontinuities \\(\\lfloor U_n \\rceil = 0\\). Take a reference frame fixed to the discontinuity with x-axis along the normal. Since mass, momentum and energy is conserved across the discontinuity, we must have from Equation 21.5 for inviscid flows (no magnetic field, y-direction represents the tangential direction), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor \\rho U_x\\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho U_x^2 + p \\rceil = 0, \\lfloor \\rho U_x U_y \\rceil=0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho U_x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}U^2 + H\\right)\\rceil=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(H\\) is the enthalpy. In tangential discontinuities, no particle transport means \\(U_{1x} = U_{2x} = 0\\). Then the x-momentum jump implies \\(\\lfloor p \\rceil=0\\), where the y-momentum jump sets no restrictions on \\(U_y\\). There is also no restriction on \\(\\rho\\). Energy equation is also satisfied. Thus, in tangential discontinuities, the density and tangential velocity components can be discontinuities, whereas the pressure must be continuous and the normal velocity component must be zero.\nThe categories of the solution of Equation 21.5 are shown in Table 21.1. The \\(\\pm\\) signs denote the changes of the downstream compared with the upstream (\\(+\\) means increase, \\(-\\) means decrease).\nThe solutions can also be summarized in the context of Riemann problem or visually in Figure 21.2.",

Since in a CD the thermal pressure remains constant, any change in density must be compensated by a change in temperature. However, a temperature jump is quickly disspated by electron heat conduction, which hints that CD do not persist long. TDs are often observed in the solar wind.\nThe Earth’s magnetopause (Section 22.7.1) is generally a tangential discontinuity. When there is no flux rope been generated, the magnetopause can be treated as the surface of pressure balance between magnetic pressure, ram pressure and thermal pressure. However, when reconnection triggers flux rope generation, it may become a rotational discontinuity (RD) (TO BE CONFIRMED!).\nIntermediate (Alfvénic) shocks are incompressive and isentropic. The rotational discontinuity is a special case of the intermediate shock. The tangential velocity relation \\(\\lfloor \\mathbf{U}_t - \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_t}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}\\rceil=0\\) can be derived from Equation 21.6 assuming the Walen relation holds, \\(U_n = B_n / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}\\), i.e. this is an Alfvénic shock. All thermodynamic quantities are continuous across the shock, but the tangential component of the magnetic field can rotate. RD is frequently observed in fast solar wind. Intermediate shocks in general however, unlike rotational discontinuities, can have a discontinuity in the pressure.\nFast- and slow-mode shocks are compressive and are associated with an increase in entropy. Fast/slow shocks have increasing/decreasing magnetic pressure from the upstream to the downstream of the shock. For example, the Earth’s bow shock is a fast, supercritical shock (See criticality in Section 21.1.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.2: Some properties of MHD shocks and discontinuities. The thick vertical line is the shock surface. The shock normal is dotted. The full arrowed lines are magnetic field lines that are refracted through the shock surface. The dashed arrowed lines are velocity vectors. Region 1 is upstream, 2 is downstream.

Causality is a general requirement in nature, meaning in this case that the drop in speed across a shock must be large enough for the normal component of the downstream flow to fall below the corresponding downstream mode velocity. For a fast shock this implies the following ordering of the normal flow and magnetosonic velocities to both sides of the shock: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_\\text{1n} &gt; c_\\text{1ms}^+ \\\\\nU_\\text{2n} &lt; c_\\text{2ms}^+\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the numbers 1, 2 refer to upstream and downstream of the fast shock wave.\nThe first condition is necessary for the shock to be formed as a priori; it is the second condition which (partially) accounts for the evolutionarity. Otherwise the small fast-mode disturbances excited downstream and moving upward towards the shock would move faster than the flow, they would overcome the shock and steepen it without limit. Since this cannot happen for a shock to form, the downstream normal speed must be less than the downstream fast magnetosonic speed. Furthermore, for fast shocks the flow velocity must be greater than the intermediate (Alfvén) speed on both sides of the shock, while for slow shocks it must be less than the intermediate speed on both sides. These conditions hold because of the same reason as otherwise the corresponding waves would catch up with the shock front, modify and destroy it and no shock could form.\n\n\n21.1.2 Coplanarity\nFor a stationary ideal MHD shock wave with no other wave activity or kinetic processes present outside the shock transition, such that dissipation takes place solely inside the narrow shock transition and this transition region can be considered as infinitesimally thin with respect to all other physical scales in the plasma, the electric field in the shock rest frame is strictly perpendicular to the magnetic field, \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{U}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\). The stationary Faraday’s law \\[\n\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} = \\dot{\\mathbf{B}} = 0\n\\] leads to the vanishing of the difference in the tangential components of the magnetic field to both sides \\[\n(U_{n2} - U_{n1})(\\mathbf{B}_{t2}\\times\\mathbf{B}_{t1}) = 0\n\\]\nFor a shock \\(\\lfloor U_n \\rceil \\neq 0\\), hence \\[\n\\mathbf{B}_{t2}\\times\\mathbf{B}_{t1} = 0\n\\] i.e. the two tangential components to both sides are strictly parallel.\nWith more details, \\(\\lfloor U_t \\rceil\\) from the RH relations and obtain \\[\n\\lfloor U_n \\mathbf{B}_t \\rceil = \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0 ... }\\lfloor \\mathbf{B}_t \\rceil\n\\]\nHence the cross product of the left with the right hand side must vanish: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor \\mathbf{B}_t \\rceil \\times \\lfloor U_n\\mathbf{B}_t \\rceil = 0 \\\\\n(\\mathbf{B}_{t2} - \\mathbf{B}_{t1})\\times(U_{n2}\\mathbf{B}_{t2} - U_{n1}\\mathbf{B}_{t1}) = 0 \\\\\n(U_{n1} - U_{n2})(\\mathbf{B}_{t1}\\times\\mathbf{B}_{t2}) = 0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_{t1} \\parallel \\mathbf{B}_{t2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.8}\\]\nThe resulting coplanarity theorem implies that the magnetic field across the shock has a reduced 2-D geometry: upstream and dowstream tangential fields are parallel to each other and coplanar with the shock normal \\(\\hat{n}\\).\nCoplanarity does not strictly hold, however. For instance, when the shock is non-stationary, i.e. when its width changes with time or in the direction tangential to the shock, then in Faraday’s law \\(\\partial\\mathbf{B}/\\partial t = \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E} \\neq 0\\), and coplanarity becomes violated.\nAlso, any upstream low frequency EM wave that propagates along the upstream magnetic field, possesses a magnetic wave field that is perpendicular to the upstream field. When it encounters the shock, this tangential component will be transformed and amplified across the shock. This naturally introduces an out-of-plane magnetic field component, thereby violating the co-planarity condition. There are also other effects which violate coplanarity at a non-MHD shock.\n\n\n21.1.3 Criticality\nShock is a dissipative structure in which the kinetic and magnetic energy of a directed plasma flow is partly transferred to heating of the plasma. The dissipation does not take place, however, by means of particle collisions for a shock in space. Collisionless shocks can be divided into super- and sub-critical, according to their Mach-numbers \\(M &lt; M_c\\) being smaller or \\(M &gt; M_c\\) larger than some critical Mach-number \\(M_c\\). \\(M_c\\) refers to a threshold value of the shock’s Mach number above which certain physical processes become dominant, leading to distinct changes in the shock’s behavior and structure.2\nDepending on the specific physical processes, we can have different critical Mach numbers associated with collisionless shocks:\n\n\\(M_c\\) for electron injection: This is the minimum Mach number above which thermal electrons in the upstream plasma can be accelerated to high energies and injected into the shock acceleration process. This injection is essential for producing the observed cosmic ray electron spectra.\n\\(M_c\\) for ion reflection: This is the minimum Mach number above which a significant fraction of upstream ions are reflected from the shock front. This ion reflection plays a crucial role in the shock dissipation process and can lead to the formation of foreshocks.\n\\(M_c\\) for whistler precursor formation: This is the minimum Mach number above which whistler waves can be excited upstream of the shock, forming a precursor wave structure that can modify the shock’s properties.\n\\(M_c\\) for nonlinear wave steepening: This is the minimum Mach number above which non-linear wave steepening effects become important, leading to the formation of solitons and other non-linear wave structures in the shock transition region.\n\nFor a resistive MHD shock Marshall [1955] had numerically determined the critical Mach number to \\(M_c\\approx 2.76\\) (see Figure 21.3). In various scenarios, \\(M_c\\) typically fall in the range of 2-10 for most astrophysical and space plasma environments.\nSubcritical shocks are capable of generating sufficient dissipation to account for retardation, thermalisation and entropy in the time the flow crosses the shock from upstream to downstream. The relevant processes are based on wave-particle interaction between the shocked plasma and the shock-excited turbulent wave fields.\nFor supercritical shocks this is, however, not the case. Supercritical shocks must evoke mechanisms different from simple wave-particle interaction for getting rid of the excess energy in the bulk flow that cannot be dissipated by any classical anomalous dissipation. Above the critical Mach number the simplest efficient way of energy dissipation is rejection of the inflowing excess energy from the shock by reflecting a substantial part of the incoming plasma back upstream. The non-thermal processes for dissipating excess energy include\n\nParticle acceleration to very high energies;\nGeneration of strong, complex magnetic fields;\nSignificant heating of the plasma.\n\nTo show how the critical Mach number of a shock arises from the Rankine-Hugoniot relations we consider the strictly perpendicular case with vanishing upstream pressure \\(P_1 = 0\\). The jump conditions become very simple in this case: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn_1 U_1 &= n_2 U_2 \\\\\nv_1 B_1 &= v_2 B_2 \\\\\nn_1 U_1^2 + \\frac{B_1^2}{2\\mu_0 m} &= n_2 U_2^2 + \\frac{P_2}{m} + \\frac{B_2^2}{2\\mu_0 m} \\\\\n\\frac{U_1^2}{2} + \\frac{B_1^2}{\\mu_0 m n_1} &= \\frac{U_2^2}{2} + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}\\frac{P_2}{m n_2} + \\frac{B_1^2}{\\mu_0 m n_1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(B\\) is the only existing tangential component of the magnetic field here, and \\(\\gamma = 5/3\\) is the adiabatic index (valid for fast, adiabatic transitions across the shock). This is the simplest imaginable case of an MHD shock, and it is easy to solve these equations. Figure 21.3 shows the resulting relation between the normalised downstream flow \\(U_2/U_1\\) and downstream sound speed \\(c_{s2}/U_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma P_2/n_2}/ v_1\\) as function of upstream Alfvén Mach number \\(M_A = U_1 \\sqrt{\\mu_0 m n_1} / B_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.3: Dependence of the downstream normalised flow \\(V_2/V_1\\) and sound \\(c_{s2}\\) velocities on the upstream Alfvén Mach number for an ideal MHD perpendicular shock with zero upstream pressure \\(P_2 = 0\\). The crossing of the two curves defines the critical Mach number which is \\(M_c = 2.76\\).\n\n\n\nThe two curves in the figure cross each other at the critical Mach number which in the present case is \\(M_c = 2.76\\) and where the downstream sound speed exceeds the flow speed. Below the critical Mach number the downstream flow is still supersonic (though clearly sub-magnetosonic!). Only above the critical Mach number the downstream flow velocity falls below the downstream sound speed. There is thus a qualitative change in the shock character above it that is not contained in the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions.\nSo as a quick recap, the inflow of matter into a supercritical shock is so fast that the time scales on which dissipation would take place are too long for dissipating the excess energy and lowering the inflow velocity below the downstream magnetosonic velocity. Hence, the condition for criticality, is that the downstream flow velocity becomes equal to the downstream sonic speed, which yielded the critical Mach number, \\(M_c \\simeq 2.76\\).\nThe determination of the critical Mach number poses an interesting question of why sonic speed appears in the downstream. The finite magnetic field compression ratio sets an upper limit to the rate of resistive dissipation that is possible in an MHD shock. Plasmas possess several dissipative lengths, depending on which dissipative process is considered. Any nonlinear wave that propagates in the plasma should steepen as long, until its transverse scale approaches the longest of these dissipative scales. Then dissipation sets on and limits its amplitude.\nThus, when the wavelength of the fast magnetosonic wave approaches the resistive length, the magnetic field decouples from the wave by resistive dissipation, and the wave speed becomes the sound speed downstream of the shock ramp. The condition for the critical Mach number is then given by \\(U_{n2} = c_{2s}\\). Similarly, for the slow-mode shock, because of its different dispersive properties, the resistive critical-Mach number is defined by the condition \\(U_{1n} = c_{1s}\\)3. Since these quantities depend on wave angle, they have to be solved numerically. Prior studies showed that critical fast-mode Mach number varies between 1 and 3, depending on the upstream plasma parameters and flow angle to the magnetic field. It is usually called first critical Mach number, because there is theoretical evidence in simulations for a second critical Mach number, which comes into play when the shock structure becomes time dependent, whistlers accumulate at the shock front and periodically cause its reformation. The dominant dispersion is then the whistler dispersion. An approximate expression for this second or whistler critical Mach number is \\[\nM_{2c} \\propto \\left( \\frac{m_i}{m_e} \\right)^{1/2}\\cos\\theta_{Bn}\n\\tag{21.9}\\] where the constant of proportionality depends on whether one defines the Mach number with respect to the whistler phase or group velocities. For the former it is \\(1/2\\), and for the latter \\(\\sqrt{27/64}\\) [Oka+, 2006].\nIt is clear that it is the smallest critical Mach number that determines the behaviour of the shock. In simple words: \\(M &gt; 1\\) is responsible for the existence of the shock under the condition that an obstacle exists in the flow, which is disturbed in some way such that fast waves can grow, steepen and form shocks. When, in addition, the flow exceeds the next lowest Mach number for a given \\(\\theta_{Bn}\\) the shock at this angle will make the transition into a supercritical shock and under additional conditions, which have not yet be ultimately clarified, will start reflecting particles back upstream. If, because of some reason, this would not happen, the flow might have to exceed the next higher critical Mach number until reflection becomes possible. In such a case the shock would become metastable in the region where the Mach number becomes supercritical, will steepen and shrink in width until other effects and – ultimately – reflection of particles can set on.\n\n\n21.1.4 Parallel Shock\nThe first special case is the so-called parallel shock in which both the upstream and downstream plasma flows are parallel to the magnetic field, as well as perpendicular to the shock front. In other words, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{U}_1 = (U_1,\\,0,\\,0),\\quad\\mathbf{U}_2 = (U_2,\\,0,\\,0) \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_1 = (B_1,\\,0,\\,0),\\quad\\mathbf{B}_2 = (B_2,\\,0,\\,0)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.10}\\]\nSubstitution into Equation 21.5 yields \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{B_2}{B_1} &= 1\\\\\n\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} &= r \\\\\n\\frac{U_2}{U_1} &= r^{-1} \\\\\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} &= R \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.11}\\] with \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr &= \\frac{(\\gamma + 1)M_1^2}{2+(\\gamma-1)M_1^2} \\\\\nR &= 1 + \\gamma M_1^2 (1-r^{-1}) = \\frac{(\\gamma+1)r - (\\gamma-1)}{(\\gamma+1) - (\\gamma-1)r}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.12}\\]\nHere, \\(M_1 = U_1/c_{s1}\\), where \\(c_{s1} = \\sqrt(\\gamma p_1/\\rho_1)\\) is the upstream sound speed. Thus, the upstream flow is supersonic if \\(M_1&gt;1\\), and subsonic if \\(M_1&lt;1\\). Incidentally, as is clear from the above expressions, a parallel shock is unaffected by the presence of a magnetic field. In fact, this type of shock is identical to that which occurs in neutral fluids, and is, therefore, usually called a hydrodynamic shock.\nIt is easily seen from Equation 21.10 that there is no shock (i.e., no jump in plasma parameters across the shock front) when the upstream flow is exactly sonic: i.e., when \\(M_1=1\\). In other words, \\(r=R=1\\) when \\(M_1=1\\). However, if \\(M_1\\neq 1\\) then the upstream and downstream plasma parameters become different (i.e., \\(r\\neq 1\\), \\(R\\neq 1\\)) and a true shock develops. In fact, it is easily demonstrated that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1} &\\leq r \\leq \\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1} \\\\\n0&\\leq R \\leq \\infty \\\\\n\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2\\,\\gamma}&\\leq M_1^2\\leq \\infty\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.13}\\]\nNote that the upper and lower limits in the above inequalities are all attained simultaneously.\nThe previous discussion seems to imply that a parallel shock can be either compressive (i.e., \\(r&gt;1\\)) or expansive (i.e., \\(r&lt;1\\)). Is there a preferential direction across the shock? In other words, can we tell the upstream and the downstream? Yes, with the additional physics principle of the second law of thermodynamics. This law states that the entropy of a closed system can spontaneously increase, but can never spontaneously decrease. Now, in general, the entropy per particle is different on either side of a hydrodynamic shock front. Accordingly, the second law of thermodynamics mandates that the downstream entropy must exceed the upstream entropy, so as to ensure that the shock generates a net increase, rather than a net decrease, in the overall entropy of the system, as the plasma flows through it.\nThe (suitably normalized) entropy per particle of an ideal plasma takes the form \\[\nS = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{\\rho^\\gamma}\\right)\n\\]\nHence, the difference between the upstream and downstream entropies is \\[\n\\lfloor S\\rceil =\\ln R - \\gamma\\,\\ln r\n\\]\nNow, using Equation 21.12, \\[\nr\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lfloor S \\rceil}{dr} = \\frac{r}{R}\\frac{dR}{dr} - \\gamma = \\frac{\\gamma(\\gamma^2-1)(r-1)^2}{[(\\gamma+1)r - (\\gamma-1)][(\\gamma+1)-(\\gamma-1)r]}\n\\]\nFurthermore, it is easily seen from Equation 21.13 that \\(\\mathrm{d}\\lfloor S \\rceil/dr\\ge 0\\) in all situations of physical interest. However, \\(\\lfloor S \\rceil = 0\\) when \\(r=1\\), since, in this case, there is no discontinuity in plasma parameters across the shock front. We conclude that \\(\\lfloor S \\rceil&lt;0\\) for \\(r&lt;1\\), and \\(\\lfloor S \\rceil&gt;0\\) for \\(r&gt;1\\). It follows that the second law of thermodynamics requires hydrodynamic shocks to be compressive: i.e., \\(r\\equiv\\rho_2 / \\rho_1&gt;1\\). In other words, the plasma density must always increase when a shock front is crossed in the direction of the relative plasma flow. It turns out that this is a general rule which applies to all three types of MHD shock. In the shock rest frame, the shock is associated with an irreversible (since the entropy suddenly increases) transition from supersonic to subsonic flow.\nThe upstream Mach number, \\(M_1\\), is a good measure of shock strength: i.e., if \\(M_1=1\\) then there is no shock, if \\(M_1-1 \\ll 1\\) then the shock is weak, and if \\(M_1\\gg 1\\) then the shock is strong. We can define an analogous downstream Mach number, \\(M_2=U_2/(\\gamma\\,p_2/\\rho_2)^{1/2}\\). It is easily demonstrated from the jump conditions that if \\(M_1&gt;1\\) then \\(M_2 &lt; 1\\). In other words, in the shock rest frame, the shock is associated with an irreversible (since the entropy suddenly increases) transition from supersonic to subsonic flow. Note that \\(r\\equiv \\rho_2/\\rho_1\\rightarrow (\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)\\), whereas \\(R\\equiv p_2/p_1\\rightarrow\\infty\\), in the limit \\(M_1\\rightarrow \\infty\\). In other words, as the shock strength increases, the compression ratio, \\(r\\), asymptotes to a finite value, whereas the pressure ratio, \\(P\\), increases without limit. For a conventional plasma with \\(\\gamma=5/3\\), the limiting value of the compression ratio is 4: i.e., the downstream density can never be more than four times the upstream density. We conclude that, in the strong shock limit, \\(M_1\\gg 1\\), the large jump in the plasma pressure across the shock front must be predominately a consequence of a large jump in the plasma temperature, rather than the plasma density. In fact, the definitions of \\(r\\) and \\(R\\) imply that \\[\n\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\equiv \\frac{R}{r}\\rightarrow \\frac{2\\gamma(\\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma+1)^2}\\gg 1\n\\] as \\(M_1\\rightarrow\\infty\\). Thus, a strong parallel, or hydrodynamic, shock is associated with intense plasma heating.\nAs we have seen, the condition for the existence of a hydrodynamic shock is \\(M_1&gt;1\\), or \\(U_1 &gt; U_{S\\,1}\\). In other words, in the shock frame, the upstream plasma velocity, \\(U_1\\), must be supersonic. However, by Galilean invariance, \\(U_1\\) can also be interpreted as the propagation velocity of the shock through an initially stationary plasma. It follows that, in a stationary plasma, a parallel, or hydrodynamic, shock propagates along the magnetic field with a supersonic velocity.\n\n\n21.1.5 Perpendicular Shock\nThe second special case is the so-called perpendicular shock in which both the upstream and downstream plasma flows are perpendicular to the magnetic field, as well as the shock front. In other words, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{U}_1 = (U_1,\\,0,\\,0),\\quad\\mathbf{U}_2 = (V_2,\\,0,\\,0) \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}_1 = (0,\\,B_1,\\,0),\\quad\\mathbf{B}_2 = (0,\\,B_2,\\,0)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.14}\\]\nSubstitution into Equation 21.5 yields \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{B_2}{B_1} &= r\\\\\n\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} &= r \\\\\n\\frac{U_2}{U_1} &= r^{-1} \\\\\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} &= R \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.15}\\] where \\[\nR = 1+ \\gamma\\,M_1^{\\,2}\\,(1-r^{-1}) + \\beta_1^{-1}\\,(1-r^2)\n\\tag{21.16}\\] and \\(r\\) is a real positive root of the quadratic \\[\nF(r) = 2\\,(2-\\gamma)\\,r^2+ \\gamma\\,[2\\,(1+\\beta_1)+ (\\gamma-1)\\beta_1 M_1^2]r - \\gamma\\,(\\gamma+1)\\,\\beta_1\\,M_1^2=0\n\\tag{21.17}\\]\nHere, \\(\\beta_1 = 2\\mu_0 p_1/B_1^2\\).\nNow, if \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are the two roots of Equation 21.17 then \\[\nr_1 r_2 = -\\frac{\\gamma(\\gamma+1)\\beta_1 M_1^2}{2(2-\\gamma)}\n\\]\nAssuming that \\(\\gamma &lt; 2\\), we conclude that one of the roots is negative, and, hence, that Equation 21.17 only possesses one physical solution: i.e., there is only one type of MHD shock which is consistent with Equation 21.14. Now, it is easily demonstrated that \\(F(0)&lt;0\\) and \\(F(\\gamma+1/\\gamma-1)&gt;0\\). Hence, the physical root lies between \\(r=0\\) and \\(r=(\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)\\).\nUsing similar analysis to that employed in the previous subsection, it is easily demonstrated that the second law of thermodynamics requires a perpendicular shock to be compressive: i.e., \\(r&gt;1\\). It follows that a physical solution is only obtained when \\(F(1)&lt;0\\), which reduces to \\[\nM_1^{\\,2} &gt; 1 + \\frac{2}{\\gamma\\,\\beta_1}\n\\]\nThis condition can also be written \\[\n\\mathbf{U}_1^2 &gt; \\mathbf{V}_{s1}^2 + \\mathbf{V}_{A1}^2 = V_{+\\,1}^2\n\\] where \\(V_{A1} = B_1/\\sqrt(\\mu_0 \\rho_1)\\) is the upstream Alfvén speed. \\(V_{+\\,1} = (V_{S\\,1}^{\\,2} + V_{A\\,1}^{\\,2})^{1/2}\\) can be recognized as the velocity of a fast wave propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field (Section 10.8.4). Thus, the condition for the existence of a perpendicular shock is that the relative upstream plasma velocity must be greater than the upstream fast wave velocity. Incidentally, it is easily demonstrated that if this is the case then the downstream plasma velocity is less than the downstream fast wave velocity. We can also deduce that, in a stationary plasma, a perpendicular shock propagates across the magnetic field with a velocity which exceeds the fast wave velocity.\nIn the strong shock limit, \\(M_1\\gg 1\\), Equation 21.16 and Equation 21.17 become identical to Equation 21.12. Hence, a strong perpendicular shock is very similar to a strong hydrodynamic shock (except that the former shock propagates perpendicular, whereas the latter shock propagates parallel, to the magnetic field). In particular, just like a hydrodynamic shock, a perpendicular shock cannot compress the density by more than a factor \\((\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)\\). However, according to Equation 21.15, a perpendicular shock compresses the magnetic field by the same factor that it compresses the plasma density. It follows that there is also an upper limit to the factor by which a perpendicular shock can compress the magnetic field.\n\n\n21.1.6 Oblique Shock\nLet us now consider the general case in which the plasma velocities and the magnetic fields on each side of the shock are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the shock front. It is convenient to transform into the so-called de Hoffmann-Teller frame in which \\(|\\mathbf{U}_1\\times \\mathbf{B}_1|=0\\), or \\[\nU_{x1}B_{y1} - U_{y1}B_{x1} = 0\n\\tag{21.18}\\]\nIn other words, it is convenient to transform to a frame which moves at the local \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) velocity of the plasma. The key idea is to extract the velocity component perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) from \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\). One temptive idea is to just remove the perpendicular part: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{dHT}} = \\mathbf{U}_1 - (\\mathbf{U}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1)\\mathbf{b}_1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{U}_1^\\prime = \\mathbf{U}_1 - \\mathbf{V}_\\mathrm{dHT} = (\\mathbf{U}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1)\\mathbf{b}_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that the transformation is not unique, since one can always add a parallel velocity component. Although the above transformation is correct, it introduces two issues:\n\nThe ram pressure \\(\\rho V_n^2\\) is changed between the two coordinates.\nEquation 21.22 may not possess a valid solution given certain parameters (e.g. \\(\\mathrm{MA}_1 = 5, \\theta_1 = 65^\\circ\\) will give \\(r&lt;1\\).)\n\nTo fix this, we can use another transformation: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{dHT}} = \\mathbf{U}_1 - \\frac{U_x}{B_x}\\mathbf{B} \\\\\n\\mathbf{U}_1^\\prime = \\mathbf{U}_1 - \\mathbf{V}_\\mathrm{dHT} = \\frac{U_x}{B_x}\\mathbf{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.19}\\]\nA nice property of this transformation is that the normal velocity component is kept the same, so is the ram pressure. Therefore, we can apply the same quantities in the lab frame as in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame.\nTaking Equation 21.18 into the 2nd jump condition of Equation 21.5 gives \\[\nU_{x2}B_{y2} - U_{y2}B_{x2} = 0\n\\tag{21.20}\\] or \\(|\\mathbf{U}_2\\times \\mathbf{B}_2|=0\\). Thus, in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame, the upstream plasma flow is parallel to the upstream magnetic field, and the downstream plasma flow is also parallel to the downstream magnetic field. Furthermore, the magnetic contribution to the jump condition Equation 21.5 (last eq.) becomes identically zero, which is a considerable simplification.\nEquation 21.18 and Equation 21.20 can be combined with the general jump conditions Equation 21.5 to give4 \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1}&=r \\\\\n\\frac{B_{x\\,2}}{B_{x\\,1}} &= 1 \\\\\n\\frac{B_{y\\,2}}{B_{y\\,1}} &= r\\frac{U_{1}^{2} - V_{A\\,1}^{2}}{U_{1}^{2} - r\\,V_{A\\,1}^{2}} \\\\\n\\frac{U_{x\\,2}}{U_{x\\,1}} &= \\frac{1}{r} \\\\\n\\frac{U_{y\\,2}}{U_{y\\,1}} &= \\frac{U_{1}^{2} - V_{A\\,1}^{2}}{U_{1}^{2}-r\\,V_{A\\,1}^{2}} \\\\\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} &= 1+\\frac{\\gamma U_1^2 (r-1)}{V_{s1}^2 r}\\left[\\cos^2\\theta_1 - \\frac{r V_{A1}^2 \\sin^2\\theta_1[(r+1)U_1^2 - 2r V_{A1}^2]}{2(U_1^2 - r\\,V_{A\\,1}^2)^2} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.21}\\] where \\(U_{x,1}=U_1\\cos\\theta_1\\) is the component of the upstream velocity normal to the shock front, and \\(\\theta_1\\) is the angle subtended between the upstream plasma flow and the shock front normal.56 Finally, given the compression ratio, \\(r\\), the square of the normal upstream velocity, \\(U_1^{\\,2}\\), is a real root of a cubic equation known as the shock adiabatic:7 \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 = & (U_{1}^2 - r V_{A1}^2)^2\\{ [(\\gamma+1) - (\\gamma-1)r]U_{1}^2\\cos^2\\theta_1 - 2r V_{s1}^2 \\} \\\\\n& -r\\sin^2\\theta_1 U_{1}^2 V_{A1}^2 \\{ [\\gamma+(2-\\gamma)r]U_{1}^2 - [(\\gamma+1) - (\\gamma-1)r]r\\, V_{A1}^2 \\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.22}\\]\nAs before, the second law of thermodynamics mandates that \\(r&gt;1\\).\nWeak shock limit\nLet us first consider the weak shock limit \\(r\\rightarrow 1\\). In this case, it is easily seen that the three roots of the shock adiabatic reduce to the slow, intermediate (or Shear-Alfvén), and fast waves, respectively, propagating in the normal direction to the shock front: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_1^{\\,2}&=V_{-\\,1}^{\\,2}\\equiv \\frac{V_{A\\,1}^{\\,2}+V_{S\\,1}^{\\,2}- [(V_{A\\,1}+V_{S\\,1})^2 -4\\,\\cos^2\\theta_1\\,V_{S\\,1}^{\\,2}\\,V_{A\\,1}^{\\,2}]^{1/2}}{2} \\\\\nU_1^{\\,2}&=\\cos^2\\theta_1\\,V_{A\\,1}^{\\,2} \\\\\nU_1^{\\,2}&=V_{+\\,1}^{\\,2}\\equiv \\frac{V_{A\\,1}^{\\,2}+V_{S\\,1}^{\\,2} + [(V_{A\\,1}+V_{S\\,1})^2 -4\\,\\cos^2\\theta_1\\,V_{S\\,1}^{\\,2}\\,V_{A\\,1}^{\\,2}]^{1/2}}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe conclude that slow, intermediate, and fast MHD shocks degenerate into the associated MHD waves in the limit of small shock amplitude. Conversely, we can think of the various MHD shocks as nonlinear versions of the associated MHD waves. It is easily demonstrated that \\[\nV_{+1} &gt; \\cos\\theta_1 V_{A1} &gt; V_{-1}\n\\]\nIn other words, a fast wave travels faster than an intermediate wave, which travels faster than a slow wave. It is reasonable to suppose that the same is true of the associated MHD shocks, at least at relatively low shock strength. It follows from Equation 21.21 that \\(B_{y2}&gt;B_{y1}\\) for a fast shock, whereas \\(B_{y\\,2}&lt;B_{y\\,1}\\) for a slow shock. For the case of an intermediate shock, we can show, after a little algebra, that \\(B_{y\\,2}\\rightarrow -B_{y\\,1}\\) in the limit \\(r\\rightarrow 1\\). We can conclude that (in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame) fast shocks refract the magnetic field and plasma flow (recall that they are parallel in our adopted frame of the reference) away from the normal to the shock front, whereas slow shocks refract these quantities toward the normal. Moreover, the tangential magnetic field and plasma flow generally reverse across an intermediate shock front. This is illustrated in Figure 21.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.4: Characteristic plasma flow patterns across the three different types of MHD shock in the shock rest frame.\n\n\n\nWhen \\(r\\) is slightly larger than unity it is easily demonstrated that the conditions for the existence of a slow, intermediate, and fast shock are \\(U_1&gt; V_{-\\,1}\\), \\(U_1&gt; \\cos\\theta_1\\,V_{A\\,1}\\), and \\(U_1&gt; V_{+\\,1}\\), respectively.\nStrong shock limit\nLet us now consider the strong shock limit, \\(U_1^{\\,2}\\gg 1\\). In this case, the shock adiabatic yields \\(r\\rightarrow r_m=(\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)\\), and \\[\nU_1^{\\,2} \\simeq \\frac{r_m}{\\gamma-1}\\,\\frac{2V_{S1}\\sin^2\\theta_1\\,[\\gamma + (2-\\gamma)\\,r_m]\\,V_{A1}^2}{r_m-r}\n\\]\nThere are no other real roots. The above root is clearly a type of fast shock. The fact that there is only one real root suggests that there exists a critical shock strength above which the slow and intermediate shock solutions cease to exist. (In fact, they merge and annihilate one another.) In other words, there is a limit to the strength of a slow or an intermediate shock. On the other hand, there is no limit to the strength of a fast shock. Note, however, that the plasma density and tangential magnetic field cannot be compressed by more than a factor \\((\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)\\) by any type of MHD shock.\n\\(\\theta_1=0\\)\nConsider the special case \\(\\theta_1=0\\) in which both the plasma flow and the magnetic field are normal to the shock front. In this case, the three roots of the shock adiabatic are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_1^2&=\\frac{2r\\,V_{S1}^2}{(\\gamma+1)-(\\gamma-1)\\,r} \\\\\nU_1^2&=r\\,V_{A1}^2 \\\\\nU_1^2&=r\\,V_{A1}^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe recognize the first of these roots as the hydrodynamic shock discussed in Section 21.1.4. This shock is classified as a slow shock when \\(V_{S\\,1}&lt;V_{A\\,1}\\), and as a fast shock when \\(V_{S\\,1}&gt; V_{A\\,1}\\). The other two roots are identical, and correspond to shocks which propagate at the velocity \\(U_1 =\\sqrt{r}\\, V_{A\\,1}\\) and “switch-on” the tangential components of the plasma flow and the magnetic field: it can be seen from Equation 21.21 that \\(U_{y\\,1}=B_{y\\,1} =0\\) whilst \\(U_{y\\,2}\\neq 0\\) and \\(B_{y\\,2}\\neq 0\\) for these types of shock.\nThere we have “switch-on” and “switch-off” shocks which refer to the generation and elimination of tangential components of the plasma flow and the magnetic field. Incidentally, it is also possible to have a “switch-off” shock which eliminates the tangential components of the plasma flow and the magnetic field. According to Equation 21.21, such a shock propagates at the velocity \\(U_1=\\cos\\theta_1\\,V_{A\\,1}\\)8. Switch-on and switch-off shocks are illustrated in Figure 21.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.5: Characteristic plasma flow patterns across switch-on and switch-off shocks in the shock rest frame.\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta_1=\\pi/2\\)\nConsider another special case \\(\\theta_1=\\pi/2\\). As is easily demonstrated, the three roots of the shock adiabatic are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_1^{\\,2}&=r \\left(\\frac{2V_{S1}^2 + [\\gamma+(2-\\gamma)\\,r]\\,V_{A1}^2} {(\\gamma+1)-(\\gamma-1)\\,r}\\right)\\\\\nU_1^{\\,2}&=0 \\\\\nU_1^{\\,2}&=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe first of these roots is clearly a fast shock, and is identical to the perpendicular shock discussed in Section 21.1.5, except that there is no plasma flow across the shock front in this case. (IS IT BECAUSE OF THE HT FRAME?) The fact that the two other roots are zero indicates that, like the corresponding MHD waves, slow and intermediate MHD shocks do not propagate perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nMHD shocks have been observed in a large variety of situations. For instance, shocks are known to be formed by supernova explosions, by strong stellar winds, by solar flares, and by the solar wind upstream of planetary magnetospheres.\n\n\n21.1.7 Switch-On and Switch-Off Shocks\nParallel shocks in MHD should, theoretically, behave exactly like gasdynamic shocks, not having any upstream tangential magnetic field component and should also not have any downstream tangential field. This conclusion does not hold rigourously, however, since plasmas consist of charged particles which are sensitive to fluctuations in the field and can excite various waves in the plasma via electric currents which then become the sources of magnetic fields. The kinetic effects in parallel and quasi-parallel shocks play an important role in their physics and are well capable of generating tangential fields at least on scales shorter than the ion scale.\nHowever, even in MHD as we have seen in the previous subsection, one stumbles across the interesting fact that this kind of shocks must have peculiar properties. The reason is that they are not, as in gasdynamics, the result of steepened sound waves, in which case they would simply be purely electrostatic shocks. At the contrary, the waves propagating parallel to the magnetic field are Alfvén and magnetosonic waves. Alfvén waves contain transverse magnetic field components. These transverse wave fields, in a parallel shock, are in fact tangential to the shock. Hence, if a purely parallel shock steepens, the transverse Alfvén waves do steepen as well, and the shock after the transition from upstream to downstream switches on a tangential magnetic component which originally was not present. Such shocks are called switch-on shocks. Similarly one can imagine the case that a tangential component behind the shock is by the same process switched off by an oppositely directed switch-on field, yielding a switch-off shock.\nThe problem of whether or not such shocks exist in MHD is related to the question whether or not an Alfvén wave steepens nonlinearly when propagating into a shock. To first order this steepening for an ordinary Alfvén wave is zero. However, to second order a wave trailing the leading Alfvén wave feels its weak transverse magnetic component. This trailing wave therefore propagates slightly oblique to the main magnetic field and thus causes a second order density compression which in addition to generating a shock-like plasma compression changes the Alfvén velocity locally. In the case when the trailing wave is polarised in the same direction as the leading wave it also increases the transverse magnetic field component downstream of the compression thereby to second order switching on a tangential magnetic component. A whole train of trailing waves of same polarisation will thus cause strong steepening in both the density and tangential magnetic field.\nClearly, this kind of shocks is a more or less exotic case of MHD shocks whose importance is not precisely known, with very rare cases of observation.",

    "text": "21.2 Double Adiabatic MHD\nThe classical approach by Chew, Goldberger, and Low (1956) utilizes the MHD framework by assuming isotropic distributions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, which results in scalar pressures on the two sides of the shock. This is now known as the CGL or double adiabatic theory.\nWhen we shift to the MHD with anisotropic pressure tensor \\[\nP_{ij} = p_\\perp \\delta_{ij} + (p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)B_i B_j / B^2\n\\] where \\(p_\\perp\\) and \\(p_\\parallel\\) are the pressures perpendicular and parallel w.r.t. the magnetic field, respectively. For the strong magnetic field approximation, the two pressures are related to the plasma density and the magnetic field strength by two adiabatic equations, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{p_\\parallel B^2}{\\rho^3} \\right) &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left( \\frac{p_\\perp}{\\rho B} \\right) &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21.23}\\]\nThis is where the name double adiabatic theory originates, which is also what many people remember to be the key conclusion from the CGL theory. However, these are constants at a fixed location in time: it is not correct to apply these across the shock. Also note the meaning of adiabatic: this means zero heat flux. If the system is not adiabatic, the conservation of these two quantities related to the parallel and perpendicular pressure is no longer valid, and additional terms may come into play such as the stochastic heating.\nThe general jump conditions for discontinuities in a collisionless anisotropic magnetoplasma in the CGL approximation were derived by Abraham-Shrauner (1967).\nThe general jump conditions for an anisotropic plasma are given in CGS units by Hudson (1970): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor \\rho U_n \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor U_n\\mathbf{B}_t - \\mathbf{U}_t B_n \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor p_\\perp + (p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)\\frac{B_n^2}{B^2} + \\frac{B_t^2}{8\\pi} + \\rho U_n^2 \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\frac{B_n \\mathbf{B}_t}{4\\pi}\\left( \\frac{4\\pi(p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)}{B^2} - 1 \\right) +\\rho U_n \\mathbf{U}_t \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho U_n\\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\rho} + \\frac{U^2}{2} + \\frac{p_\\perp}{\\rho} + \\frac{B_t^2}{4\\pi \\rho} \\right) + \\frac{B_n^2 U_n}{B^2}&(p_\\parallel - p_\\perp) \\\\\n- \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_t\\cdot\\mathbf{U}_t B_n}{4\\pi}\\left( 1 - \\frac{4\\pi(p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)}{B^2} \\right) \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor B_n \\rceil &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the mass density, \\(U\\) and \\(B\\) are the velocity and magnetic field strength. Subscripts \\(t\\) and \\(n\\) indicate tangential and normal components with respect to the discontinuity. Quantities \\(p_\\perp\\) and \\(p_\\parallel\\) are the elements of the plasma pressure tensor perpendicular and parallel with respect to the magnetic field. Quantity \\(\\epsilon\\) is the internal energy, \\(\\epsilon = p_\\perp + p_\\parallel/2\\), and \\(\\lfloor Q \\rceil = Q_2 - Q_1\\), where subscripts 1 and 2 signify the quantity upstream and downstream of the discontinuity. These equations refer to the conservation of physical quantities, i.e. the mass flux, the tangential component of the electric field, the normal and tangential components of the momentum flux, the energy flux, and, finally, the normal component of the magnetic field. To solve the jump equations for anisotropic plasma conditions upstream and downstream of the shock, one has to use an additional equation, since the set of equations is underdetermined. One common choice is the magnetic field/density jump ratio.\nThe following derivations follow (Erkaev, Vogl, and Biernat 2000). Let us introduce two dimensionless parameters, \\(A_s\\) and \\(A_m\\), which are determined for upstream conditions as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_s &= \\frac{p_{\\perp 1}}{\\rho_1 v_1^2} \\\\\nA_m &= \\frac{1}{M_A^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(M_A\\) is the upstream Alfvén Mach number. For common solar wind conditions, both of these parameters are quite small (\\(\\sim 0.01\\)).\nFor shocks, the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields are coplanar (Equation 21.8). Thus, the components of the magnetic field upstream of the shock are given as \\(B_{n1} = B_1 \\cos\\theta_1\\) and \\(B_{t1} = B_1 \\sin\\theta_1\\), where \\(\\theta_1\\) is the angle between the magnetic field vector and the vector \\(\\hat{n}\\) normal to the discontinuity. Similarly, the components of the bulk velocity upstream of the shock are chosen as \\(U_{n1} = U_1 \\cos\\alpha\\) and \\(U_{t1} = B_1 \\sin\\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) the angle between the bulk velocity and the normal component of the velocity. Furthermore, a parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is used to denote the pressure anisotropy \\[\n\\lambda = p_\\perp / p_\\parallel\n\\] and another parameter \\(r\\) is used to denote the ratio of density \\[\nr \\equiv \\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{U_{n1}}{U_{n2}}\n\\]\n\n21.2.1 Perpendicular Shock\nFor a perpendicular shock, \\(B_n = 0\\), we have the conservation relations reduce to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor \\rho U_n \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor U_n\\mathbf{B}_t \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor p_\\perp + \\frac{B_t^2}{8\\pi} + \\rho U_n^2 \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho U_n \\mathbf{U}_t \\rceil &= 0 \\\\\n\\lfloor \\rho U_n\\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\rho} + \\frac{U^2}{2} + \\frac{p_\\perp}{\\rho} + \\frac{B_t^2}{4\\pi \\rho} \\right) \\rceil &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe quantities downstream of the discontinuity are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_{t2} &= r B_{t1} \\\\\nU_{t2} &= U_{t1} \\\\\np_{\\perp 2} &= p_{\\perp 1} + \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{8\\pi}(1-r^2) + \\rho_1 U_{n1}^2\\big( 1 - \\frac{1}{r} \\big)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSubstituting these into the energy equation leads to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\lambda_1(3\\lambda_2 +1)\\xi^3 − \\lambda_1(4\\lambda_2 +1)(2A_S + A_M +2)\\xi^2 \\\\\n+ \\lambda_2[2\\lambda_1(4A_S + 1 + 2A_M) + 2A_S ]\\xi + A_M \\lambda_1 = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\xi = 1/r\\).\nNow we can do some simple estimations. Assume we have isotropic upstream solar wind with \\(n = 2\\,\\textrm{amu/cc}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v} = [600, 0, 0]\\,\\textrm{km/s}\\), \\(\\mathbf{B} = [0, 0, -5]\\,\\textrm{nT}\\) in GSM coordinates, and \\(T = 5\\times 10^5\\,\\textrm{K}\\). We want to estimate the downstream anisotropy given a density/tangential magnetic field jump of 3.\nKeyNotes.shock_estimation()\nAnother thing to note is that, if you set the jump ratio to 4 (maximum value when \\(\\gamma = 5/3\\)) in the above calculations, the downstream anisotropy will become 0.6. This indicates that under this set of upstream conditions, the jump ratio shall never be close to 4 if the anisotropy \\(T_\\perp/T_\\parallel &gt; 1\\)!",

    "section": "21.3 Subcritical Shocks",
    "text": "21.3 Subcritical Shocks\nSubcritical shocks, also known as laminar shocks, have Mach numbers between 1 and \\(M_c\\) which can be described by the combined action of dispersion and dissipation present in dispersive waves in collisionless plasmas. Subcritical shocks have been believed to be rare in space; they were mostly restrictedly associated to heavy mass loading of the solar wind as is the case in the vicinity of comets and unmagnetised planets like Venus and Mars, in particular at Venus with its dense atmosphere. However, they might be much more frequent simply due to the properties of nonlinear dispersive waves which are capable of steeping and evolving into shocks.\nEvolution of subcritical shocks in the latter case is now quite well understood, even though the generation of anomalous resistance and anomalous dissipation below the critical Mach number still poses many unresolved problems. It is well established that the subcritical shock evolves through the various phases of steeping of a low frequency magnetosonic wave the character of which has been identified of being on the whistler mode branch. This steeping process is completely collisionless. The modes propagate against the upstream flow, forming a train of localised wave modes where the steeping is produced by sideband generation of higher spatial harmonics all propagating (approximately) at the same phase (group) velocity such that their amplitudes are in phase and superimpose on the mother wave. When the gradient length of the leading wave packet becomes comparable to the dissipation scale \\(L_d\\), dissipation sets on. At this time the smaller scale higher harmonic sidebands either outrun the leading wave packet ending up as standing, spatially damped precursor wave modes in front of the shock, or forming a spatially damped trailing wake of the packet. This depends on whether the dispersion is convex or concave (sign of \\(\\partial^2 \\omega /\\partial k^2\\)). This dispersive effect limits the amplitude of the shock. At the same time the ramp is formed out of the wave packet by the dissipation generated inside the shock.\nGeneration of dissipation is most likely due to electron current instabilities of the shock ramp current on a scale that is shorter than the ion inertial scale. So far the instability has not yet been identified, but we have given strong arguments that it is the modified two stream instability which signs responsible. The anomalous collision rate is at the lower hybrid frequency in the shock ramp, quite high in this case and sufficient for providing the necessary dissipation for entropy generation, shock heating and compression. In addition, other small scale effects might occur which we have only given a hint on but not discussed in depth.\nAs long as the shocks are subcritical with Mach numbers \\(M &lt; M_c\\) the distinction between quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel shocks is not overwhelmingly important, at least as long as the shock normal angle is far from zero. However, as we will see in the next sections, when the Mach number increases and finally exceeds the critical Mach number, \\(M &gt; M_c\\), the distinction becomes very important.",

    "section": "21.4 Supercritical Perpendicular Shock",
    "text": "21.4 Supercritical Perpendicular Shock\nQuasi-perpendicular shocks are the first and important family of collisionless magnetised shocks which reflect particles back upstream in order to satisfy the shock conditions. Discussion of the particle dynamics gives clear definition for distinguishing them from quasi-parallel shocks by defining a shock normal angle with respect to the upstream magnetic field. They exist for shock normal angles \\(&lt; 45^\\circ\\). Reflected particles at quasi-perpendicular shocks cannot escape far upstream along the magnetic field. After having performed half a gyro-circle back upstream they return to the shock ramp and ultimately traverse it to become members of the downstream plasma population; they also form a foot in front of the shock ramp. We discuss the reflecting shock potential and the explicit shock structure. Most theoretical insight is provided by numerical simulations which confirm reflection, foot formation and reformation of the shock. The latter being caused by steeping of the foot disturbance until the foot itself becomes the shock transition, reflecting particles upstream. Reformation modulates the shock temporarily but on the long terms guarantees its stationarity. Ion and electron dynamics are explicitly discussed in view of the various instabilities involved as well as particle acceleration and shock heating. Finally, a sketchy model of a typical quasi-perpendicular shock transition is provided.\nIn order to help maintain a shock in the supercritical case the shock must forbid an increasing number of ions to pass across its ramp, which is done by reflecting some particles back upstream. This is not a direct dissipation process, rather it is an emergency act of the shock. It throws a fraction of the incoming ions back upstream and by this reduces both the inflow momentum and energy densities. Clearly, this reflection process slows the shock down by attributing a negative momentum to the shock itself. The shock slips back and thus in the shock frame also reduces the difference velocity to the inflow, i.e. it reduces the Mach number. In addition, however, the reflected ions form an unexpected obstacle for the inflow and in this way reduce the Mach number a second time.\n\n21.4.1 Particle Dynamics\nLet’s return to the orbit a particle interacting with a supercritical shock when it becomes reflected from the shock. In the simplest possible model one assumes the shock to be a plane surface, and the reflection being specular turning the component \\(v_n\\) of the instantaneous particle velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) normal to the shock by \\(180^\\circ\\), i.e. simply reflecting it. Here we follow the explicit calculation for these idealised conditions as given by S. J. Schwartz, Thomsen, and Gosling (1983) who treated this problem in the most general way. One should, however, keep in mind that the assumption of ideal specular reflection is the extreme limit of what happens in reality, which is no more than a convenient assumption. In fact, reflection must by no means be specular because\n\nThe shock ramp is not a rigid wall; the particles penetrate into it at least over a distance of a fraction of their gyroradius.\nParticles interact with waves and even excite waves during this interaction and during their approach of the shock.\n\nFigure 5.1 shows the coordinate frame used at the planar (stationary) shock, with shock normal \\(\\hat{n}\\), magnetic \\(\\hat{b}\\) and velocity \\(\\hat{v}\\) unit vectors, respectively. Shown are the angles \\(\\theta_{Bn},\\,\\theta_{Vn},\\,\\theta_{BV}\\). The velocity vector \\(\\mathbf{V}_\\text{HT}\\) is the de Hoffmann-Teller velocity which lies in the shock plane and is defined in such a way that in the coordinate system moving along the shock plane with velocity \\(\\mathbf{V}_\\text{HT}\\) the plasma flow is along the magnetic field, \\(\\mathbf{U} − \\mathbf{V}_\\text{HT} = −v_\\parallel \\hat{b}\\). Because of the latter reason it is convenient to consider the motion of particles in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame. The guiding centers of the particles in this frame move all along the magnetic field. Hence, using \\(\\mathbf{U} = −U\\hat{v}\\), \\(\\hat{n}\\cdot\\hat{v} = \\cos\\theta_{Vn}\\), \\(\\hat{n}\\cdot(\\hat{b},\\,\\hat{x},\\,\\hat{y})=(\\cos\\theta_{Bn},\\sin\\theta_{Bn},0)\\), \\[\nv_\\parallel = U\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{Vn}}{\\cos\\theta_{Bn}},\\quad \\mathbf{V}_\\text{HT} = U\\left( -\\hat{v} + \\frac{\\cos\\theta_{Vn}}{\\cos\\theta_{Bn}}\\hat{b} \\right) = \\frac{\\hat{n}\\times\\mathbf{U}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}},\\quad V_\\text{HT,n}\\equiv 0\n\\tag{21.24}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.6: The shock coordinate system showing the shock normal \\(\\hat{n}\\), velocity and magnetic field directions \\(\\hat{v}\\), \\(\\hat{b}\\), the three angles \\(\\theta_{Bn},\\,\\theta_{Vn},\\,\\theta_{BV}\\) between \\(\\hat{b}\\) and \\(\\hat{n}\\), velocity \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and \\(\\hat{n}\\), and velocity \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and \\(\\hat{b}\\), respectively. The velocity \\(\\mathbf{V}_\\text{HT}\\) in the shock plane is the deHoffmann-Teller velocity (after S. J. Schwartz, Thomsen, and Gosling 1983).\n\n\n\nThe de Hoffmann-Teller velocity is the same to both sides of the shock ramp, because of the continuity of normal component \\(B_n\\) and tangential electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}_t\\). Thus, in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame there is no induction electric field \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\hat{n}\\times\\mathbf{U}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\). The remaining problem is two-dimensional (because trivially \\(\\hat{n}\\), \\(\\hat{b}\\) and \\(-v_\\parallel\\hat{b}\\) are coplanar, which is nothing else but the coplanarity theorem holding under these undisturbed idealized conditions).\nIn the de Hoffmann-Teller (primed) frame the particle velocity is described by the motion along the magnetic field \\(\\hat{b}\\) plus the gyromotion of the particle in the plane perpendicular to \\(\\hat{b}\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{v}^\\prime(t) = v_\\parallel^\\prime\\hat{b} + v_\\perp\\left[ \\hat{x}\\cos(\\omega_{ci}t +\\phi_0) \\mp\\hat{y}\\sin(\\omega_{ci}t + \\phi_0) \\right]\n\\tag{21.25}\\]\nThe unit vectors \\(\\hat{x}\\), \\(\\hat{y}\\) are along the orthogonal coordinates in the gyration plane of the ion, the phase \\(\\phi_0\\) accounts for the initial gyro-phase of the ion, and \\(\\pm\\) accounts for the direction of the upstream magnetic field being parallel (+) or antiparallel (-) to \\(\\hat{b}\\).\nIn specular reflection (from a stationary shock) the upstream velocity component along \\(\\hat{n}\\) is reversed, and hence (for cold ions) the velocity becomes (???) \\[\n\\mathbf{v}^\\prime = -v_\\parallel^\\prime\\hat{b} + 2v_\\parallel \\cos\\theta_{Bn}\\hat{n}\n\\] which (with \\(\\phi_0 = 0\\)) yields for the components of the velocity \\[\n\\frac{v_\\parallel^\\prime}{U} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_{Vn}}{\\cos\\theta_{Bn}}\\left( 2\\cos^2\\theta_{Bn} - 1 \\right) \\quad \\frac{v_\\perp^\\prime}{U} = 2\\sin\\theta_{Bn}\\cos\\theta_{Vn}\n\\]\nThese expressions can be transformed back into the observer’s frame by using \\(\\mathbf{V}_\\text{HT}\\). It is, however, of greater interest to see under which conditions a reflected particle turns around in its upstream motion towards the shock. This happens when the upstream component of the velocity \\(v_x = 0\\) of the reflected ion vanishes. For this we need to integrate Equation 21.25 which for \\(\\phi_0 = 0\\) yields \\[\n\\mathbf{x}^\\prime(t) = v_\\parallel^\\prime t \\hat{b} + \\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_{ci}}\\left[ \\hat{x}\\sin\\omega_{ci}t \\pm\\hat{y}(\\cos\\omega_{ci}t -1) \\right]\n\\]\nScalar multiplication with \\(\\hat{n}\\) yields the ion displacement normal to the shock in upstream direction. The resulting expression \\[\n\\mathbf{x}_n^\\prime(t^\\ast) = v_\\parallel^\\prime t \\cos\\theta_{Bn} + \\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_{ci}}\\sin\\theta_{Bn}\\sin\\omega_{ci}t^\\ast = 0\n\\tag{21.26}\\] vanishes at time \\(t^\\ast\\) when the ion re-encounters the shock with normal velocity \\[\nv_n(t^\\ast) = v_\\parallel^\\prime \\cos\\theta_{Bn} + v_\\perp\\sin\\theta_{Bn}\\cos\\omega_{ci}t^\\ast\n\\]\nThe maximum displacement away from the shock in normal direction is obtained when setting this velocity to zero, obtaining for the time \\(t_m\\) at maximum displacement (again including the initial phase here) \\[\n\\omega_{ci}t_m + \\phi_0 = \\cos^{-1}\\left( \\frac{1 - 2\\cos^2\\theta_{Bn}}{2\\sin^2\\theta_{Bn}} \\right)\n\\tag{21.27}\\]\nThis expression must be inserted in \\(\\mathbf{x}_n\\) yielding for the distance a reflected ion with gyroradius \\(r_{ci} = V/\\omega_{ci}\\) can achieve in upstream direction \\[\n\\Delta x_n = r_{ci}\\cos\\theta_{Vn}\\left[ (\\omega_{ci}t_m + \\phi_0)(2\\cos^2\\theta_{Bn} - 1) + 2\\sin^2\\theta_{Bn}\\sin(\\omega_{ci}t_m +\\phi_0) \\right]\n\\tag{21.28}\\]\nFor a perpendicular shock \\(\\theta_{Bn} = 90^\\circ\\) and \\(\\phi_0 = 0\\) this distance is \\(\\Delta x_n \\simeq 0.7 r_{ci} \\cos\\theta{Vn}\\), less than an ion gyro radius. The distance depends on the shock normal angle, decreasing for non-planar shocks. Note that the argument of \\(\\cos^{-1}\\) in Equation 21.27 changes sign for \\(\\theta_{Bn} \\le 45^\\circ\\). Equation 21.26 has solutions for positive upstream turning distances only for shock normal angles \\(\\theta_{Bn} &gt; 45^\\circ\\), for an initial particle phase \\(\\phi_0 = 0\\).9 Reflected ions can return to the shock in one gyration time only when the magnetic field makes an angle with the shock normal that is larger than this value. For less inclined shock normal angles the reflected ions escape along the magnetic field upstream of the shock and do not return within one gyration. This sharp distinction between shock normal angles \\(\\theta_{Bn} &lt; 45^\\circ\\) and \\(\\theta_{Bn} &gt; 45^\\circ\\) thus provides the natural (kinematic specular) discrimination between quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel (planar) shocks we were looking for.\nThe theory of shock particle reflection holds, in this form, only for cold ions, which implies complete neglect of any velocity dispersion and proper gyration of the ions. The ions are considered of just moving all with one and the same oblique flow velocity \\(\\mathbf{U}\\). In a warm plasma each particle has a different speed, and it is only the group of bulk velocity ions which are described by the above theory. Fortunately, these are the particles which experience the reflecting shock potential strongest and are most vulnerable to specular reflection. When temperature effects will be included, the theory is more involved in a number of ways:\n\nThe de-Hoffmann-Teller velocity must be redefined to include the microscopic particle motion.\nThe assumption of ideal specular reflection becomes questionable, as the particles themselves become involved into the generation of the shock potential. However, observations in space suggest that, for high flow velocities and supercritical Mach numbers, the simple kinematic reflection is a sufficiently well justified mechanism.\n\nThe formal treatment for warm ions are shown in P153 of Balogh and Treumann (2013). The result is that including thermal effect may\n\nmodify the angle of transition, and\nwill substantially affect the distance up to that a specularly reflected particle at the quasi-perpendicular shock can penetrate the upstream flow, i.e. it affects the width of the quasi-perpendicular shock-foot, even in the case when the reflection process is genuinely specular.\n\n\n\n21.4.2 Foot Formation and Acceleration\nShock reflected ions in a quasi-perpendicular shock cannot escape far upstream (see Figure 21.7). Their penetration into the upstream plasma is severely restricted by Equation 21.28. Within this distance the ions perform a gyration orbit before returning to the shock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.7: Top: Reflected ion orbits in the foot of a quasi-perpendicular shock in real space. The ion impacts under an instantaneous angle \\(\\theta_{Vn}\\), is reflected from the infinitely thin shock, performs a further partial gyration in the upstream field \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) where it is exposed to the upstream convection electric field \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{U}_1 \\times \\mathbf{B}_1\\) in which it is accelerated as is seen from the non-circular section of its orbit in the shock foot. It hits the shock ramp a second time now at energy high enough to overcome the shock potential, passing the ramp and arriving in the compressed downstream magnetic field behind the shock where it performs gyrations of reduced gyro-radius. Bottom: The ion distribution function mapped into velocity space \\(v_x\\), \\(v_y\\) for the indicated regions in real space, upstream in the foot, at the ramp, and downstream of the shock ramp. Upstream the distribution consists of the incoming dense plasma flow (population 1, dark circle at \\(v_y = 0\\)) and the reflected distribution 2 at large negative \\(v_y\\). At the ramp in addition to the incoming flow 1 and the accelerated distribution \\(2^\\prime\\) there is the newly reflected distribution 3. Behind the ramp in the downstream region the inflow is decelerated \\(1^\\prime\\) and slightly deflected toward non-zero \\(v_y\\), and the energised passing ions exhibit gyration motions in different instantaneous phases, two of them (\\(2^{\\prime\\prime}\\), 4) directed downstream, one of them (\\(2^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\)) directed upstream. (redrawn after Sckopke et al. 1983).\n\n\n\nSince the reflected ions are about at rest with respect to the inflowing plasma they are sensitive to the inductive convection electric field \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{U}_1 \\times \\mathbf{B}_1\\) behaving very similar to pick-up ions and becoming accelerated in the direction of this field to achieve a higher energy (S. J. Schwartz, Thomsen, and Gosling 1983). When returning to the shock their maximum (minimum) achievable energy is \\[\n\\epsilon_\\text{max} = \\frac{m_i}{2}\\left[ (v_\\parallel^\\prime + V_\\text{HT})^2 + (V_\\text{HT} \\pm v_\\perp)^2 \\right]\n\\tag{21.29}\\]\nThis energy is larger than their initial energy with that they have initially met the shock ramp and, under favourable conditions, they now might overcome the shock ramp potential and escape downstream. Otherwise, when becoming reflected again, they gain energy in a second round until having picked up sufficient energy for passing the shock ramp.\nIn addition to this energization of reflected ions which in the first place have not made it across the shock, the reflected ions when gyrating and being accelerated in the convection electric field constitute a current layer just in front of the shock ramp of current density \\(J_y\\sim e n_\\text{i,refl} v_\\text{y, refl}\\) which gives rise to a foot magnetic field of magnitude \\(B_\\text{z, foot}\\sim \\mu_0 j_y \\Delta x_n\\). It is clear that this foot ion current, which is essentially a drift current in which only the reflected newly energized ion component participates, constitutes a source of free energy as it violates the energetic minimum state of the inflowing plasma in its frame. Being the source of free energy it can serve as a source for excitation of waves via which it will contribute to filling the lack of dissipation. However, in a quasi-perpendicular shock there are other sources of free energy as well which are not restricted to the foot region.\nFigure 21.8 shows a sketch of some of the different free-energy sources and processes across the quasi-perpendicular shock. In addition to the shock-foot current and the presence of the fast cross-magnetic field ion beam there, the shock ramp is of finite thickness. It contains a charge separation electric field \\(E_x\\) which in the supercritical shock is strong enough to reflect the lower energy ions. In addition it accelerates electrons downstream thereby deforming the electron distribution function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.8: Geometry of an ideally perpendicular supercritical shock showing the field structure and sources of free energy. The shock is a compressive structure. The profile of the shock thus stands for the compressed profile of the magnetic field strength \\(|B|\\), the density N, temperature T, and pressure NT of the various components of the plasma. The inflow of velocity \\(\\mathbf{V}_1\\) and outflow of velocity \\(\\mathbf{V}_2\\) is in the x direction, and the magnetic field is in the z direction. Charge separation over an ion gyroradius \\(r_{ci}\\) in the shock ramp magnetic field generates a charge separation electric field \\(E_x\\) along the shock normal which reflects the low-energy ions back upstream. These ions see the convection electric field \\(E_y\\) of the inflow, which is along the shock front, and become accelerated. The magnetic field of the current carried by the accelerated back-streaming ions causes the magnetic foot in front of the shock ramp. The shock electrons are accelerated antiparallel to \\(E_x\\) perpendicular to the magnetic field. The shock electrons also perform an electric field drift in y-direction in the crossed \\(E_x\\) and compressed \\(B_{z2}\\) fields which leads to an electron current \\(J_y\\) along the shock. These different currents are sources of free energy which drives various instabilities in different regions of the perpendicular shock. (Balogh and Treumann 2013)\n\n\n\nThe presence of this field, which has a substantial component perpendicular to the magnetic field, implies that the magnetized electrons with their gyro-radii being smaller than the shock-ramp width experience an electric drift \\(V_{ye} = -E_x/ B_{z2}\\) along the shock in the ramp which can be quite substantial giving rise to an electron drift current \\(J_{ye} = -en_\\text{e,ramp}V_{ye} = en_\\text{e,ramp}E_x/B_{z2}\\) in the y-direction. This current has again its own contribution to the magnetic field, which at maximum is roughly given by \\(B_z \\sim \\mu_0 J_{ye}\\Delta x_n\\). Here we use the width of the shock ramp. The electron current region might be narrower, of the order of the electron skin depth \\(d_e = c/\\omega_{pe}\\). However, as long as we do not know the number of magnetized electrons which are involved into this current nor the width of the electric field region (which must be less than an ion gyro-radius because of ambipolar effects) the above estimate is good enough.\nThe magnetic field of the electron drift current causes an overshoot in the magnetic field in the shock ramp on the downstream side and a depletion of the field on the upstream side contributing to the steepness of the ramp. When this current becomes strong it contributes to current-driven cross-field instabilities like the modified two-stream instability.\nFinally, the mutual interaction of the different particle populations present in the shock at its ramp and behind provide other sources of free energy. A wealth of instabilities and waves is thus expected to be generated inside the shock. To these micro-instabilities add the longer wavelength instabilities which are caused by the plasma and field gradients in this region. These are usually believed to be less important as the crossing time of the shock is shorter than their growth time. However, some of them propagate along the shock and have therefore substantial time to grow and modify the shock profile. In the following we will turn to the discussion of numerical investigations of some of these processes reviewing their current state and provide comparison with observations.\n\n\n21.4.3 Shock Potential Drop\nOne of the important shock parameters is the electric potential drop across the shock ramp – or if it exists also across the shock foot. This potential drop is not necessarily a constant but changes with location along the shock normal. We have already noted that it is due to the different dynamical responses of the inflowing ions and electrons over the scale of the foot and ramp regions. Its theoretical determination is difficult, however when going to the de Hoffmann-Teller frame the bulk motion of the particles is only along the magnetic field, and in the stationary electron equation of motion the \\(\\mathbf{V}_e \\times \\mathbf{B}\\)-term drops out and, to first approximation, the cross shock potential is given by the pressure gradient (when neglecting any contributions from wave fields). The expression is then simply \\[\n\\Delta \\Phi(x) = \\int_0^x \\frac{1}{eN_e(n)}\\left[ \\nabla\\cdot \\overleftarrow{P}_e(n) \\right]\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{n}\n\\tag{21.30}\\]\nIntegration is over \\(n\\) along the shock normal \\(\\hat{n}\\). For a gyrotropic electron pressure, valid for length scales longer than an electron gyroradius, \\(\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e = P_{e\\perp}\\mathbf{I} + (P_{e\\parallel} - P_{e\\perp})\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}/BB\\) one obtains (Goodrich and Scudder 1984), taking into account that \\(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\) is invariant, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}n}\\phi(n) = -\\frac{E_\\parallel}{\\cos\\theta_{Bn}} = \\frac{1}{eN_e}\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}n}P_{e\\parallel} - (P_{e\\parallel} - P_{e\\perp})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}n}(\\ln B) \\right]\n\\] which, when used in the above expression, yields \\[\ne\\Delta \\Phi(x) = \\int_0^x \\mathrm{d}n\\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_{e\\parallel}}{\\mathrm{d}n} + T_{e\\parallel}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}n}\\ln\\left[ \\frac{N(n)}{N_1}\\frac{B_1}{B(n)} \\right] + T_{e\\perp}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}n}\\ln\\left[ \\frac{B(n)}{B_1} \\right] \\right\\}\n\\]\nThis expression can approximately be written in terms of the gradient in the electron magnetic moment \\(\\mu_e = T_{e\\perp}/B\\) as follows: \\[\ne\\Delta\\Phi(x) \\simeq \\Delta(T_{e\\parallel} + T_{e\\perp}) - \\int_0^x \\mathrm{d}n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu_e(n)}{\\mathrm{d}n}B(n)\n\\] with \\(T_e\\) in energy units. When the electron magnetic moment is conserved, the last term disappears, yielding a simple relation for the potential drop \\(e\\Delta\\Phi(x) \\simeq \\Delta(T_{e\\parallel} + T_{e\\perp})\\) as the sum of the changes in electron temperature. The perpendicular temperature change can be expressed as \\(\\Delta T_{e\\perp} = T_{e\\perp,1}\\Delta B/B_1\\) which is in terms of the compression of the magnetic field. Non-adiabatic effects contribute via the dropped integral term, which breaks the adiabatic invariant.\nThe parallel change in temperature is more difficult to express. One could express it in terms of the temperature anisotropy \\(A_e = T_{e\\parallel} /T_{e\\perp}\\) as has been done by Kuncic et al [2002], and then vary \\(A_e\\). But this depends on the particular model. It is more important to note that this adiabatic estimate of the potential drop does not account for any dynamical process which generates waves and substructures in the shock. It thus gives only a hint on the order of magnitude of the potential drop across the foot-ramp region in quasi-perpendicular shocks.\n\n\n21.4.4 Shock Structure",

    "section": "21.5 Supercritical Parallel Shock",
    "text": "21.5 Supercritical Parallel Shock\nFrom MHD or double adiabatic theory, parallel shocks are more special in that the magnetic field strength remains unchanged so the equations effectively describe pure gasdynamic solutions. (Kuznetsov and Osin 2018) presents a simplified solution in a 1D parallel shock case with parallel and perpendicular thermal energy heat fluxes \\(S_\\parallel\\) and \\(S_\\perp\\) included. Note again the original CGL theory assumes 0 heat fluxes.\nHowever, as have been indicated in Section 21.1.7, this does not cover the real physics involved into parallel shocks which must be treated on the basis of kinetic theory and with the simulation tool at hand. These shocks possess an extended foreshock region with its own extremely interesting dynamics for both types of particles, electrons and ions, reaching from the foreshock boundaries to the deep interior of the foreshock. Based mostly on kinetic simulations, the foreshock is the region where dissipation of flow energy starts well before the flow arrives at the shock. This dissipation is caused by various instabilities excited by the interaction between the flow and the reflected particles that have escaped to upstream from the shock. Interaction between these waves and the reflected and accumulated particle component in the foreshock causes wave growth and steeping, formation of shocklets and pulsations and causes continuous reformation of the quasi-parallel shock that differs completely from quasi-perpendicular shock reformation. It is the main process of maintaining the quasi-parallel shock which by its nature principally turns out to be locally nonstationary and, in addition, on the small scale making the quasi-parallel shock close to becoming quasi-perpendicular for the electrons. This process can be defined as turbulent reformation, with transient phenonmena like hot flow anomalies, foreshock bubbles, and the generation of electromagnetic radiation. Foreshock physics is important for particle acceleration.\nThe turbulent nature implies that the quasi-parallel shock transition is less sharp than the quasi-perpendicular shock transition and thus less well defined; there exists an extended turbulent foreshock instead of a shock foot. This foreshock consists of an electron and an ion foreshock. The main population is a diffuse ion component. The turbulence in the foreshock is generated by the reflected and accelerated foreshock particle populations. An important point in quasi-parallel shock physics is the reformation of the shock which works completely differently from quasi-perpendicular shocks; here it is provided by upstream low-frequency electromagnetic waves excited by the diffuse ion component. Steeping of these waves during shockward propagation and addition of the large amplitude waves at the shock transition reforms the shock front. The old shock front is expelled downstream where it causes downstream turbulence. During the reformation process the shock becomes locally quasi-perpendicular for the ions supporting particle reflection.\n\n21.5.1 Turbulent Reformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.9: The patchwork model of J. Schwartz Steven and David (1991) of a quasi-parallel supercritical shock reformation. Left: Magnetic pulsations (SLAMS) grow in the ion foreshock and are convected toward the shock where they accumulate, thereby causing formation of an irregular shock structure. Note also the slight turning of the magnetic field into a direction that is more perpendicular to the shock surface with the shock surface itself becoming very irregular. Right: The same model with the pulsations being generated in the relatively broad ULF-wave-unstable region in greater proximity to the ion-foreshock boundary. When the ULF waves evolve to large amplitude and form localised structures these are convected toward the shock, grow, steepen, overlap, accumulate and lead to the build up of the irregular quasi-parallel shock structure which overlaps into the downstream direction.\n\n\n\nLucek+ [2002] checked this expectation by determining the local shock-normal angle \\(\\theta_{Bn}\\) and comparing it with the prediction estimated from magnetic field measurements by the ACE spacecraft which was located farther out in the upstream flow. The interesting result is that during the checked time-interval of passage of the quasi-parallel shock the prediction for the shock normal was around \\(20-30^\\circ\\), as expected for quasi-parallel shocks. However, this value just set a lower bound on the actually measured shock normal angle. The measured \\(\\theta_{Bn}\\) was highly fluctuating around much larger values and, in addition, showed a tendency to be close to \\(90^\\circ\\). It strengthens the claim that quasi-parallel shocks are locally, on the small scale, very close to perpendicular shocks, a property that they borrow from the large magnetic waves by which they are surrounded. In fact, we may even claim that locally, on the small scale (\\(\\leq \\mathcal{O}(d_i)\\)), quasi-parallel shocks are quasi-perpendicular.\nThus, the quasi-parallel shock is the result of a build-up from upstream waves which continuously reorganise and reform the shock. The shock transition region turns out to consist of many embedded magnetic pulsations (SLAMS) of very large amplitudes. These pulsations have steep flanks and quite irregular shape, exhibit higher frequency oscillations probably propagating in the whistler mode while sitting on the feet or shoulders of the pulsations.\nAnother interesting property of magnetic pulsations in the shock transition region is the electric cross-SLAMS potential, which corresponds to a steep pressure gradient. The pulsations are subject to a fairly large number of high frequency, Debye scale structures in the electric field. These intense nonlinear electrostatic electron plasma waves indicates that the quasi-parallel shocks are sources of electron acceleration into beams which are capable to move upstream along the magnetic field over a certain distance and excite electron plasma waves at intensity high enough to enter into the nonlinear regime, forming solitons and electron holes (BGK modes). This is possible only if quasi-parallel shocks are quasi-perpendicular as well on the electron scale.\n\n\n21.5.2 Parallel Shock Particle Reflection\nThere are two possible mechanisms:\n\nA quasi-parallel shock is capable of generating a large cross-shock potential, or it is capable of stochastically – or nearly stochastically – scattering ions in the shock transition region in pitch angle and energy in such a way that part of the incoming ion distribution can escape upstream.\nOn a scale that affects the ion motion, a quasi-parallel shock close to the shock transition becomes sufficiently quasi-perpendicular that ions are reflected in the same way as if they encountered a quasi-perpendicular shock.",

    "section": "21.6 Instabilities and Waves",
    "text": "21.6 Instabilities and Waves\nIn the context of collisionless shocks the instabilities of interest can be divided into two classes. The first class contains those waves which can grow themselves to become a shock. It is clear that these waves will be of low frequency and comparably large scale because otherwise they would not evolve into a large macroscopic shock. The primary candidates are magnetosonic, Alfvén and whistler modes. A number of waves can form secondarily after an initial seed shock ramp and grow in some way out of one of these wave modes: these are ion modes which have now been identified to be responsible for structuring, shaping and reforming the shock. In fact real oblique shocks — which are the main class of shocks in interplanetary space and probably in all space and astrophysical objects — cannot survive without the presence of these ion waves which can therefore be considered the wave modes that really produce shocks in a process of taking and giving between shock and waves.\nThe second class includes waves that accompany the shock and provide anomalous transport coefficients like anomalous collision frequencies, friction coefficients, heat conductivity and viscosity. These waves are also important for the shock as they contribute to entropy generation and dissipation. However, they are not primary in the sense that they are not shock-forming waves.\nAmong them there is another group that only carries away energy and information from the shock. These are high-frequency waves, mostly electrostatic in nature, produced by electrons or when electromagnetic they are in the free-space radiation modes. In the latter case they carry the information from remote objects as radiation in various modes, radio or x-ray to Earth, informing of the existence of a shock. In interplanetary space it is only radio waves which fall into this group as the radiation measure of the heliospheric shocks is too small to map them into x-rays.\nHere we restrict mostly to low frequency EM waves in warm plasma, \\(\\omega\\le \\omega_{ci}\\), while only mention the high frequency EM waves in the end. Such waves are excited by plasma streams or kinetic anisotropies in one or the other way. A simple summary is given in Table 21.2.\n\n\n\nTable 21.2: Types of instabilities and waves related to shocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\nWave Type\nHandedness\nOther Properties\n\n\n\n\nFirehose\nAlfvén\nleft\nParallel prefered anisotropy\n\n\nIon-Ion Beam\nFast\nright\nCool beam\n\n\nIon cyclotron\nAlfvén\nleft\nWarm beam\n\n\nKAW\nAlfvén\nright\nElectron, parallel electric field\n\n\nWhistler\nAlfvén\nright\nHall term, electron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.6.1 Ion Instabilities \\(\\omega \\leq \\omega_{ci}\\)\n\n21.6.1.1 Firehose mode\nThe simplest instability known which distorts the magnetic field by exciting Alfvén waves that propagate along the magnetic field is the firehose mode. The wave excited are ordinary Alfvén waves, however, and are not suited for shock formation.\nWhen the ion beam is fast and cold it does not go into resonance because its velocity is too high. In this case all ions participate in a nonresonant instability which in fact is a thermal firehose mode where the ion beam has sufficient energy to shake the field line. This mode propagates antiparallel to the ion beam, has small phase speed and negative helicity. This mode has large growth rate for large \\(n_b / n_e\\) and \\(v_b / v_A\\) simply because then there are many beam ions and the centrifugal force is large while the beam velocity lies outside any resonant wave speed. This instability becomes stronger when the ion beam is composed of heavier ions as the larger mass of these increases the centrifugal force effect.\n\n\n21.6.1.2 Kinetic Alfvén waves\nKAWs (Section 10.9.4) possess a finite \\(E_\\parallel\\) which can accelerate electrons; in the other way, electron moving along the magnetic field in the opposite direction become retarded and feed their energy into KAWs.\nNormally this is likely to be a minor effect, as the interaction of ions which are reflected from a solitary pulse and move back upstream ahead of the pulse will cause a stronger instability. The reflected ions will represent a beam that is moving against the initial plasma inflow which by itself is another ion beam neutralised by the comoving electrons. The free energy presented in the two counter-streaming beams leads to various instabilities as viewed by Gary (1993).\n\n\n21.6.1.3 Kinetic growth rate\nAt low frequencies it suffices for our purposes of understanding shock physics to deal with a three-component plasma consisting of two ion species and one neutralising electron component which we assume to follow a Maxwellian velocity distribution. Moreover, we assume that the drifting ion components are Maxwellians as well. In conformity with the above remarks on a resonant instability we assume that the dominant ion component has large density \\(n_i\\gg n_b\\), and the second component represents a weak fast beam of density \\(n_b\\) propagating on the ion-electron background with velocity \\(v_b \\gg v_i \\approx = 0\\). Following Gary (1993) it is convenient to distinguish the three regimes:\n\ncool beams (\\(0&lt;v&lt;v_b\\))\nwarm beams (\\(v\\sim v_b\\))\nhot beams (\\(v\\gg v_b\\))\n\nFigure 21.10 shows the beam configurations for these three cases and the location of the wave resonances respectively the position of the unstable frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.10: The three cases of ion beam-plasma interaction and the location of the unstable frequencies. Shown is the parallel (reduced) distribution function \\(F_i(k_\\parallel v_\\parallel)\\), where for simplicity the (constant) parallel wavenumber \\(k_\\parallel\\) has been included into the argument. Right handed resonant modes (RH) are excited by a cool not too fast beam. When the beam is too fast the interaction becomes nonresonant. When the beam is hot, a resonant left hand mode (LH) is excited. In addition the effect of temperature anisotropy is shown when a plateau forms on the distribution function (after Gary 1993).\n\n\n\n\n\n21.6.1.4 Cold Ion Beam: Right-Hand Instability\nAssume that the ion beam is thermally isotropic and cool, i.e. its velocity relative to the bulk plasma is faster than its thermal speed. In this case a right-handed resonant instability occurs. In the absence of a beam \\(v_b=0\\) the parallel mode is a right-circularly polarised magnetosonic wave propagating on the lowest frequency whistler dispersion branch with \\(\\omega\\approx k_\\parallel v_A\\). In presence of a drift this wave becomes unstable, and the fastest growing frequency is at frequency \\(\\omega \\simeq k_\\parallel v_b - \\omega_{ci}.\\) This mode propagates parallel to the beam, because \\(\\omega&gt;0\\), \\(k_\\parallel &gt; 0\\), and \\(v_b &gt; 0\\). The numerical solution of this instability for densities \\(0.01 \\le n_b/n_i \\le 0.1\\) at the wave-number \\(k_\\parallel\\) of fastest growth rate identifies a growth rate of the order of the wave frequency \\(\\gamma\\sim\\omega\\) and \\[\n\\gamma_m \\simeq \\omega_{ci}\\left( \\frac{n_b}{n_e} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\] for the maximum growth rate \\(\\gamma_m\\), where \\(n_e = n_i + n_b\\) is the total density from quasi-neutrality. This instability drives waves propagating together with the beam in the direction of the ion beam on the plasma background which has been assumed at rest. If applied for instance, to shock reflected ions then for 2% reflected ions the maximum growth rate is \\(\\gamma_m\\sim 0.2\\omega_{ci}\\), and \\(v_b\\sim 1.2 \\omega_{ci}/k_\\parallel\\), \\(k_\\parallel\\sim 0.2 \\omega_{ci}/v_A\\) which gives \\(v_b \\sim 6 v_A\\). In the solar wind the Alfvén velocity is about \\(v_A ≈ 30\\,\\mathrm{km/s}\\). Hence the velocity difference between shock reflected ions and solar wind along the magnetic field should be roughly \\(\\sim 180\\,\\mathrm{km/s}\\).10 The thermal velocity of the ion beam must thus be substantially less than this value, corresponding to a thermal beam energy less than \\(T_b \\ll 100\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\) which in the solar wind, for instance, is satisfied near the tangential field line. The solar wind travels at 300–1200 km/s. Complete reflection should produce beam speeds twice these values.11\nThe cyclotron resonance condition associated with the generated fast magnetosonic mode is \\[\n\\omega = v_b k_\\parallel - \\omega_{ci}\n\\tag{21.31}\\] where \\(v_b\\) is the beam velocity and \\(\\omega_{ci}\\) the ion gyrofrequency. It can be approximated as \\(\\omega=v_A k_\\parallel\\).\n\n\n21.6.1.5 Warm Ion Beam: Left-Hand Instability\nWhen the temperature of the ion beam increases and the background ions remain to be cold, then beam ions appear on the negative velocity side of the bulk ion distribution and go into resonance there with the left-hand polarised ion-Alfvén wave. The maximum growth rate is a fraction of the growth rate of the right-hand low frequency whistler mode.12 Nevertheless it can excite the Alfvén-ion cyclotron wave which also propagates parallel to the beam. For this instability the beam velocity must exceed the Alfvén speed \\(v_b &gt; v_A\\).\nAt oblique propagation both the right and left hand instabilities have smaller growth rates. But interestingly, it has been shown by Goldstein et al. (1985) that the fastest growing modes then appear for oblique \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency \\(\\omega\\sim n\\omega_{ci}, n=1,2,...\\).13\n\n\n\n21.6.2 Electron Instabilities and Radiation \\(\\omega \\sim \\omega_{pe}\\)\nOther than ion beam excited instabilities electron-beam instabilities are not involved in direct shock formation (unless the electron beams are highly relativistic which in the entire heliosphere is not the case). The reason is that the frequencies of electron instabilities are high. However, just because of this reason they are crucial in anomalous transport being responsible for anomalous collision frequencies and high frequency field fluctuations. The reason is that the high frequency waves lead to energy loss of the electrons retarding them while for the heavier ions they represent a fluctuating background scattering them. In this way high frequency waves may contribute to the basic dissipation in shocks even though this dissipation for supercritical shocks will not be sufficient to maintain a collisionless shock or even to create a shock under collisionless conditions. This is also easy to understand intuitively, because the waves need time to be created and to reach a substantial amplitude. This time in a fast stream is longer than the time the stream needs to cross the shock. So waves will not accumulate there; rather the fast stream will have convected them downstream long before they have reached substantial amplitudes for becoming important in scattering.\nWhen we are going to discuss electromagnetic waves which can be excited by electrons we also must keep in mind that such waves can propagate only when there is an electromagnetic dispersion branch in the plasma under consideration. These electromagnetic branches in \\((\\omega,\\mathbf{k})\\)-space are located at frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency \\(\\omega_{ce}\\). The corresponding branch is the whistler mode branch. Electrons will (under conditions prevailing at shocks) in general not be able to excite electromagnetic modes at higher frequencies than \\(\\omega_{ce}\\). We have seen before that ion beams have been able to excite whistlers at low frequencies but above the ion-cyclotron frequency. This was possible only because of the presence of the high frequency electron whistler branch as a channel for wave propagation. EM waves excited by electrons propagate on the whistler branch or its low frequency Alfvénic extension, both of which are right-handed. They also excite a variety of electrostatic emissions.\n\n\n21.6.3 Whistlers\nGary (1993) has investigated the case of whistler excitation by an electron beam. He finds from numerical solution of the full dispersion relation including an electron beam in parallel motion that with increasing beam velocity \\(v_b\\) the real frequency of the unstable whistler decreases, i.e. the unstably excited whistler shifts to lower frequencies on the whistler branch while remaining in the whistler range \\(\\omega_{ci} &lt; \\omega &lt; \\omega_{ce}\\). Both the background electrons and beam electrons contribute resonantly. The most important finding is that the whistler mode for sufficiently large \\(\\beta_i \\sim 1\\) (which means low magnetic field), \\(n_b/n_e\\) and \\(T_b/T_e\\) has the lowest beam velocity threshold when compared with the electrostatic electron beam instabilities as shown in Figure 21.11. This finding implies that in a relatively high-β plasma a moderately dense electron beam will first excite whistler waves. In the shock environment the conditions for excitation of whistlers should thus be favourable whenever an electron beam propagates across the plasma along the relatively weak magnetic field. The electrons in resonance satisfy \\(v_\\parallel = (\\omega - \\omega_{ce})/k_\\parallel\\) and, because \\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_{ce}\\) the resonant electrons move in the direction opposite to the beam. Enhancing the beam temperature increases the number of resonant electrons thus feeding the instability.\nOn the other hand, increasing the beam speed shifts the particles out of resonance and decreases the instability. Hence for a given beam temperature the whistler instability has a maximum growth rate a few times the ion cyclotron frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.11: The regions of instability of the electron beam excited whistler mode in density and beam velocity space for two different β compared to the ion acoustic and electron beam modes. Instability is above the curves. The whistler instability has the lowest threshold in this parameter range (after Gary 1993).",

    "section": "21.7 Shock Particle Reflection",
    "text": "21.7 Shock Particle Reflection\nThe process of particle reflection from a shock wave is one of the most important processes in the entire physics of collisionless shocks. However, the mechanism of particle reflection has not yet been fully illuminated.\nParticle reflection is required in supercritical shocks as it is the only process that can compensate for the incapability of dissipative processes inside the shock ramp to digest the fast inflow of momentum and energy into the shock. Shock particle reflection is not dissipative by itself even though in a fluid picture which deals with moments of the distribution function it can be interpreted as kind of an ion viscosity, i.e. it generates an anomalous viscosity coefficient which appears as a factor in front of the second derivative of the ion velocity in the ionic equation of motion. As such it also appears in the ion heat-transport equation. The kinematic ion viscosity can be expressed as \\[\n\\mu_\\mathrm{vis} = m_i n \\nu_i \\lambda_\\mathrm{mfp} \\simeq P_i / 2\\omega_{ci}\n\\] through the ion pressure \\(P_i\\) and the ion-cyclotron frequency \\(\\omega_{ci}\\) when replacing the mean free path through the ion gyro-radius. In this sense shock particle reflection constitutes by itself a very efficient non-dissipative dissipation mechanism. However, its direct dissipative action is to produce real dissipation as far as possible upstream of the shock in order to dissipate as much energy of motion as remains to be in excess after formation of a shock ramp, dissipation inside the ramp, and reflection of ion back upstream. The shock does this by inhibiting a substantial fraction of inflow ions to pass across the shock from upstream into the downstream region. It is sending these ions back into the upstream region where they cause a violently unstable upstream ion beam-plasma configuration which excites a large amplitude turbulent wave spectrum that scatters the uninformed plasma inflow, heats it and retards it down to the Mach number range that can be digested by the shock. In this way the collisionless shock generates a shock transition region that extends far upstream with the shock ramp degrading to the role of playing a subshock at the location where the ultimate decrease of the Mach number from upstream to downstream takes place.\nShock reflection has another important effect on the shock as the momentum transfer from the reflected particle component to the shock retards the shock in the region of reflection thereby decreasing the effective Mach number of the shock.\n\n21.7.1 Specular Reflection\nSpecular reflection of ions from a shock front is the simplest case to be imagined. It requires that the ions experience the shock ramp as an impenetrable wall. This can be the case when the shock itself contains a positive reflecting electric potential which builds up in front of the approaching ion. Generation of this electric potential is not clarified yet. In a very naive approach one assumes that in flowing magnetised plasma a potential wall is created as the consequence of charge separation between electrons and ions in penetrating the shock ramp. It occurs over a scale typically of the spatial difference between an ion and an electron gyro-radius, because in the ideal case the electrons, when running into the shock ramp, are held temporarily back in the steep magnetic field gradient over this distance while the ions feel the magnetic gradient only over a scale longer than their gyro-radius and thus penetrate deeper into the shock transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.12: The two cases of shock reflection. Left: Reflection from a potential well \\(\\Phi(x)\\). Particles of energy higher than the potential energy \\(e\\Phi\\) can pass while lower energy particles become reflected. Right: Reflection from the perpendicular shock region at a curved shock wave as the result of magnetic field compression. Particles move toward the shock like in a magnetic mirror bottle, experience the repelling mirror force and for large initial pitch angles are reflected back upstream.\n\n\n\n\nReflection from Shock Potential\n\nDue to this simplistic picture the shock ramp should contain a steep increase in the electric potential \\(\\Delta\\Phi\\) which will reflect any ion which has less kinetic energy \\(m_i V_N^2/2 &lt; e\\Delta\\Phi\\) (Figure 21.12).\n\nMirror Reflection\n\nAnother simple possibility for particle reflection from a shock ramp in magnetised plasma is mirror reflection. An ion approaching the shock has components \\(v_{i\\parallel}\\). Assume a curved shock like Earth’s bow shock. Close to its perpendicular part where the upstream magnetic field becomes tangential to the shock the particles approaching the shock with the stream and moving along the magnetic field with their parallel velocities experience a mirror magnetic field configuration that results from the converging magnetic field lines near the perpendicular point (Figure 21.12). Conservation of the magnetic moment \\(\\mu = T_{i\\perp}/B\\) implies that the particles become heated adiabatically in the increasing field; they also experience a reflecting mirror force \\(-\\mu \\nabla_\\parallel B\\) which tries to keep ions away from entering the shock along the magnetic field. Particles will mirror at the perpendicular shock point and return upstream when their pitch angle becomes 90◦ at this location. (??? Leroy & Mangeney, 1984; Wu, 1984)\nSpecular reflection from shocks is the extreme case of shock particle reflection. Other mechanisms like turbulent reflection are, however, not well elaborated and must in any case be investigated with the help of numerical simulations.\n\n\n21.7.2 Consequences of Shock Reflection\nHow far the reflected ions return upstream depends on the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the shock, i.e. on the shock normal angle \\(\\theta_{Bn}\\). For perpendicular shocks the reflected ions only pass just one gyro-radius back upstream. Seeing the convection electric field \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{flow}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) they become accelerated along the shock forming a current, the velocity of which in any case exceeds the inflow velocity (which is zero in the perpendicular direction) and for sufficiently cold ions also the ion acoustic velocity \\(c_{ia}\\) in which case the ion-beam plasma instability will be excited in the shock foot region where the ion current flows. This may generate anomalous collision in the shock foot region. Moreover, since the excited waves accelerate electrons along the magnetic field other secondary instabilities can arise as well.\nIn quasi-perpendicular and oblique shocks the ions can escape along the magnetic field. In this case an ion two-stream situation arises between the upstream beam and the plasma inflow with the consequence of excitation of a variety of electromagnetic and electrostatic instabilities. In addition, however, an ion-electron two-stream situation is caused between the upstream ions and the inflow electrons which because of the large upstream electron temperatures probably excites mainly ion-acoustic modes but can also lead to Buneman two-stream mode excitation. These modes contribute to turbulence in the upstream foreshock region creating a weakly dissipative state in the foreshock where the plasma inflow becomes informed about the presence of the shock. The electromagnetic low frequency instabilities on the other hand, which are excited in this region, will grow to large amplitude, form localised structures and after being convected by the main flow towards the shock ramp interact with the shock and modify the shock profile or even contribute to shock formation and shock regeneration.",

    "section": "21.8 Shock Particle Acceleration",
    "text": "21.8 Shock Particle Acceleration\nIn the context of cosmic rays that have been observed in the interstellar space, medium energy particles refer to ~ few GeV ions and ~ few MeV electrons. Above these ranges relativistic shocks must be considered. Near the Earth’s bow shock the solar wind hydrogen kinetic energy is ~ 1 keV; ~ 10 keV is about the low threshold for energetic ions. Here we limit our discussions first to the non-relativistic case.\nFigure 21.13 shows schematically the process of particle acceleration. Based on early estimations by Fermi (1949), a large number of shock crossings and reflections back and forth is required for the particles to reach energetic cosmic ray level. The scattering process is a stochastic process that is assumed to conserve energy; in particular they should not become involved into excitation of instabilities which consume part of their motional energy. The only actual dissipation that is allowed in this process is dissipation of bulk motional energy from where the few accelerated particles extract their energy gain. This dissipation is also attributed to direct particle loss by either convective transport or the limited size of the acceleration region. Thus this mechanism works until the gyro-radius of the accelerated particle becomes so large that it exceeds the size of the system.\nThe stochastic process implies that the basic equation that governs the process is a phase space diffusion equation in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial F(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{x}, t)}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla F(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{x},t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}_{pp}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial F(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{x}, t)}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}},\\quad \\mathbf{D}_{pp}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left&lt; \\frac{\\Delta \\mathbf{p}\\Delta \\mathbf{p}}{\\Delta t} \\right&gt;\n\\] where \\(\\Delta \\mathbf{p}\\) is the variation of the particle momentum in the scattering process which happens in the time interval \\(\\Delta t\\), and the angular brackets indicate ensemble averaging. \\(\\mathbf{D}_{pp}\\) is the momentum space diffusion tensor. It is customary to define \\(\\mu = \\cos\\alpha\\) as the cosine of the particle pitch angle \\(\\alpha\\) and to understand among \\(F(p,\\mu)\\) the gyro-phase averaged distribution function, which depends only on \\(p = |\\mathbf{p}|\\) and \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.13: Schematic of the acceleration mechanism of a charged particle in reflection at a quasi-parallel (\\(\\theta_{Bn} &lt; 45^\\circ\\)) supercritical shock. The upstream plasma flow (left, \\(\\mathbf{V}_1 \\gg \\mathbf{V}_2\\)) contains the various upstream plasma modes: upstream waves, shocklets, whistlers, pulsations. The downstream (right) is turbulent. The energetic particle that is injected at the shock to upstream is reflected in an energy gaining collision with upstream waves, moves downstream where it is reflected in an energy loosing collision back upstream. It looses energy because it overtakes the slow waves, but the energy loss is small. Returning to upstream it is scattered a second time again gaining energy. Its initially high energy is successively increased until it escapes from the shock and ends up in free space as an energetic Cosmic Ray particle. The energy gain is on the expense of the upstream flow which is gradually retarded in this interaction. However, the number of energetic particles is small and the energy gain per collision is also small. So the retardation of the upstream flow is much less than the retardation it experiences in the interaction with the shock-reflected low energy particles and the excitation of upstream turbulence.\n\n\n\nThe dependence on the gyro-radius imposes a severe limitation on the acceleration mechanism, i.e. the injection problem. In order to experience a first scattering, i.e. in order to being admitted to the acceleration process, the particle must initially already possess a gyro-radius much larger than the entire width of the shock transition region. Only when this condition is given, the shock will behave like an infinitesimally thin discontinuity separating two regions of vastly different velocities such that the particle when crossing back and forth over the shock can become aware of the bulk difference in speed and take an energetic advantage of it. This restriction rules out any particles in the core of the upstream inflow distribution from participation in the acceleration process: in order to enter the Fermi shock-acceleration mechanism a particle must be pre-accelerated or pre-heated until its gyro-radius becomes sufficiently large. This condition poses the injection problem, where an unresolved seed population of energetic particles are needed for further acceleration, that has not yet been resolved.\nForeshock transients (Section 21.9), especially HFAs and FBs, can accelerate particles and contribute to the primary shock acceleration. These can form secondary shocks which leads to several possible acceleration mechanisms; they can also cause local magnetic reconnection that accelerate particles. The interaction with foreshock transients provides a possible solution to Fermi’s injection problem and increase the acceleration efficiency of primary shocks.\n\nAs foreshock transients convect with the upstream flow, particles enclosed within their boundary and the primary shock can experience Fermi acceleration.\nSecondary shocks have also been observed to accelerate upstream particles on their own through the shock drift acceleration (SDA)14 and even to form a secondary foreshock.\nSecondary shocks can also capture and further energize primary shock-accelerated electrons through betatron acceleration.\nMagnetic reconnection inside foreshock transients contributes to the electron and ion acceleration/heating.\n\nAnother problem awakens attention is that how the shocks are modulated by the presence of energetic particles.\nIn terms of particle acceleration the shock appears as a boundary between two independent regions of different bulk flow parameters which are filled with scattering centres for the particles as sketched in Figure 21.14. Theoretically ((Balogh and Treumann 2013)) any particle which returns from downstream to upstream is accelerated in the upstream flow, even in the absence of any upstream turbulence and scatterings. If the upstream medium is magnetised and is sufficiently extended to host the upstream gyration orbit, pick-up ion energization can happen via the convection electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}=-\\mathbf{V}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) all along their upstream half-gyrocircles. Alternatively, the upstream turbulence can also cause ion energization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.14: Cartoon of the diffusive shock acceleration (left) and shock heating mechanisms [after an sketch by M. Scholer and Hoshino]. In diffusive shock acceleration the particle is scattered around the shock being much faster than the shock. The requirement is the presence of upstream waves and downstream turbulence or waves. In shock heating the particle is a member of the main particle distribution, is trapped for a while at the shock and thereby thermalised and accelerated until leaving the shock.",

HFAs are typically driven by a solar wind tangential discontinuity (TD) that intersects the bow shock with solar wind convection electric field pointing inward on at least one side of the TD. Such a TD can locally trap foreshock ions leading to the HFA formation while propagating along the bow shock surface. HFAs may accelerate particles efficiently through Fermi acceleration, i.e., bouncing between the converging HFA boundary and the bow shock. The observed energetic ions may also have escaped from the outer magnetosphere.\nOne of the most remarkable properties of HFAs is the strong deflection of the solar wind bulk flow which can be large enough that inside an HFA the flow can actually show a sunward component. A transient region of lower density in the solar wind interacting with the fast shock can cause the disruption of the fast shock and leads to a new shock that actually travels into the upstream direction with plasma behind this new shock having a much smaller momentum density and velocity than the original solar wind.\n\n\n21.9.2 Spontaneous Hot Flow Anomaly\nSHFAs have the same characteristics as HFAs except that they are not associated with any solar wind discontinuities. They form intrinsically in the quasi-parallel regime, likely due to the interaction between foreshock cavitons and the bow shock.\nIn order to distinguish SHFAs from cavitons in simulations, an additional empirical criterion of SHFA having \\(\\beta &gt; 10\\) in at least 60% of the transient region has been used. It is chosen in order to not make assumptions on the level of heating and flow deflection inside the transients. A value of 10 indicates that the transients are dominated by the plasma instead of the magnetic field, and it is significantly above the typical β in the surrounding foreshock (\\(β \\sim 1-4\\)).\n\n\n21.9.3 Foreshock Bubble\nWhen backstreaming foreshock ions interact with a solar wind rotational discontinuity (RD) that does not necessarily intersect the bow shock, FBs form upstream of the RD and convecting anti-sunward with it. Later observations and simulations found that TDs can also drive FBs. FBs are also characterized by a heated, tenuous core with significant flow deflection. Different from HFAs and SHFAs, the expansion of FBs is super-fast-magnetosonic and dominantly in the sunward direction. Because of the sunward super-fast-magnetosonic expansion, a shock forms upstream of the core, and the FB size in the expansion direction can reach 5-10 \\(\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\), larger than typical HFAs and SHFAs. In addition to their significant dynamic pressure perturbations, FBs are also efficient particle accelerators due to the presence of the shock (e.g., shock drift acceleration and Fermi acceleration as the shock converges towards the bow shock).\n\n\n21.9.4 Foreshock Cavity\nForeshock cavities are characterized by low density, low field strength core regions with high density, high field strength compressional boundaries on two sides. But different from HFAs, the flow deflection inside foreshock cavities is rather weak and plasma heating is not significant. When slabs of magnetic field lines connected to the bow shock are bounded by broader regions of magnetic field lines that remain unconnected to the bow shock, only the slabs are filled with energized particles reflected from the bow shock. The presence of foreshock particles enhanced the thermal pressure, causing an expansion on two sides. Such an expansion decreases the plasma density and magnetic field strength inside the slabs and increases the density and field strength at two boundaries, i.e., a foreshock cavity forms.\n\n\n21.9.5 Foreshock Caviton\nForeshock cavitons are also characterized by a core region with low density and field strength bounded by two boundaries with high density and field strength, without clear heating and flow deflection. Their sizes are about one \\(\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\). They form due to the nonlinear evolution of two types of waves: the parallel propagating right- or left-hand polarized waves and the obliquely propagating linearly polarized fast magnetosonic waves. Thus, foreshock cavitons are embedded in foreshock ULF waves, whereas foreshock cavities are isolated due to their different formation mechanisms.\n\n\n21.9.6 Foreshock Compressional Boundary\nFCBs have enhanced density and field strength. They occur at the boundary between the foreshock and the pristine solar wind. Because of the high thermal pressure due to the presence of foreshock ions, the foreshock region expands into the ambient pristine solar wind, leading to the formation of an FCB. FCBs are sometimes associated with local density and field strength depletion on their foreshock side. FCBs can form under either steady or nonsteady IMF conditions.\n\n\n21.9.7 SLAMS and Shocklets\nShort Large-Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are magnetic pulsations with amplitudes at least two times the ambient magnetic field strength. SLAMS have typical spatial scales up to many ion gyroradii (where the thermal ion gyroradius is typically 160 km in the solar wind) and grow rapidly with time scales of seconds. Shocklets are also magnetic structures (nonlinearly steepened magnetosonic waves), but differ from SLAMS in terms of amplitude, spatial scale, growth rate, and propagation angle.\n\n\n21.9.8 Density Hole\nDensity holes are characterized by similarly shaped magnetic holes with enhanced density and field strength at one or both edges. The definition of density holes overlaps with HFAs, SHFAs, FBs, foreshock cavities, and foreshock cavitons, but in a broader sense. Lu et al. (2022) showed statistically that ∼66% of 411 density holes cannot be categorized by any of these foreshock transient types. Therefore, it is necessary to make density holes a separate category. A better definition of density holes is needed to definitely distinguish them from other foreshock transient types, which requires further studies. The formation could be due to the interaction between backstreaming particles and the original solar wind (Parks et al. 2006).",

In other words, they think the bow shock is a gasdynamic structure.\nHowever, even in neutral fluid theory, the determination of shock location as well as shape is still an ongoing research. Imagine the simplest scenario where there is a static ball in the air with infinite mass. Assuming purely homogenous air with known density, velocity and pressure in the upstream, can you tell me the exact location of shock stand-off distance with pen and paper?\nOn top of that, the introduction of EM field complicates the story. Especially in the case of a parallel shock, the plasmas get “shocked” both upstream and downstream, and the stand-off distance of the shock may not be a single point theoretically. In some sense, normal magnetic field to the boundary “thickens” the shock front.",

I prefer U for fluid velocities and V for particle velocities.↩︎\nIn aerodynamics, the critical Mach number \\(M^\\ast\\) of an aircraft is the lowest Mach number at which the airflow over some point of the aircraft reaches the speed of sound, but does not exceed it. For an aircraft in flight, the speed of the airflow around the aircraft differs considerably in places from the airspeed of the aircraft; this is due to the airflow having to speed up and slow down as it travels around the aircraft’s structure. When the aircraft’s airspeed reaches the critical Mach number, the speed of the airflow in some areas near the airframe reaches the speed of sound, even though the aircraft itself has an airspeed lower than Mach 1.0. This creates a weak shock wave. As the aircraft exceeds the critical Mach number, its drag coefficient increases suddenly, causing dramatically increased drag, and may lead to deterioration in control of the aircraft.↩︎\nso it depends on the upstream sound speed?↩︎\nOne way to define the tangential direction \\(\\hat{t}\\) is to use \\(\\mathbf{U}_{t1}\\) as a reference: \\(\\mathbf{U}_{t1} = \\mathbf{U}_1 - (\\mathbf{U}_1 \\cdot \\hat{n})\\hat{n}\\).

The dipole axis is tilted 11◦ from the direction of the Earth’s rotation axis. The current circuit giving rise to the magnetic field is located in the liquid core about 1200–3400 km from the center of the planet. The current system is asymmetric displacing the dipole moment from the center, which together with inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic matter above the core gives rise to large deviations from the dipole field on the surface. The pure dipole field on the surface would be 30 µT at the dipole equator and 60 µT at the poles. However, the actual surface field exceeds 66 µT in the region between Australia and Antarctica and is weakest, about 22 µT, in a region called South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA).",

    "text": "22.1.1 Basic Structures\nIn the frame of reference of the Earth the solar wind is supermagnetosonic, exceeding the local magnetosonic speed \\(v_ms = \\sqrt{v_s^2 + v_A^2}\\), where \\(v_s\\) is the sound speed, \\(v_A\\) is the Alfvén speed. Because fluid-scale perturbations cannot propagate faster than \\(v_{ms}\\), this leads to a formation of a collisionless shock front, called the bow shock, upstream of the magnetosphere. Under typical solar wind conditions the apex of the shock in the solar direction is about 3 \\(R_E\\) upstream of the magnetopause. The shock converts a considerable fraction of solar wind kinetic energy to heat and electromagnetic energy. The irregular shocked flow region between the bow shock and the magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.\n\n\n22.1.2 The Dipole Field\nThe dipole field is an idealization where the source current is assumed to be confined into a point at the origin. The source of planetary and stellar dipoles is a finite, actually a large, current system within the celestial body. Such fields, including the Terrestrial magnetic field, are customarily represented as a multipole expansion: dipole, quadrupole, octupole, etc. When moving away from the source, the higher multipoles vanish faster than the dipole making the dipole field a good starting point to consider the motion of charged particles. In the dipole field charged particles behave adiabatically as long as their gyro radii are smaller than the gradient scale length of the field (Section 7.8) and their orbits are not disturbed by collisions or time-varying electromagnetic field.\nFor the geomagnetic field it is customary to define the spherical coordinates in a special way. The dipole moment (\\(\\mathbf{m}_\\mathrm{E}\\)) is in the origin and points approximately toward geographic south, tilted 11◦ as mentioned above. Similar to the geographic coordinates the latitude (\\(\\lambda\\)) is zero at the dipole equator and increases toward the north, whereas the latitudes in the southern hemisphere are negative. The longitude (\\(\\phi\\)) increases toward the east from a given reference longitude. In magnetospheric physics the longitude is often given as the magnetic local time (MLT). In the dipole approximation MLT is determined by the flare angle between two planes: the dipole meridional plane containing the subsolar point on the Earth’s surface, and the dipole meridional plane which contains a given point on the surface, i.e., the local dipole meridian. Magnetic noon (MLT = 12 h) points toward the Sun, midnight (MLT = 24 h) anti-sunward. Magnetic dawn (MLT = 6 h) is approximately in the direction of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.\nThe SI-unit of \\(m_\\mathrm{E}\\) is \\(\\mathrm{A}\\, \\mathrm{m}^2\\). Sometimes it is convenient to replace \\(m_\\mathrm{E}\\) by \\(k_0 = \\mu_0 m_\\mathrm{E}/4\\pi\\), which is also customarily called dipole moment. The strength of the terrestrial dipole moment varies slowly. A sufficiently accurate approximation is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_\\mathrm{E} &= 8\\times 10^{22}\\, \\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\\\\nk_0 &= 8\\times 10^{15}\\, \\mathrm{Wb}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\, (\\mathrm{SI}:\\mathrm{Wb} = \\mathrm{T}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) \\\\\n&= 8\\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{G}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3\\, (\\mathrm{Gaussian units}, 1\\,\\mathrm{G}=10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\\\\n&= 0.3\\,\\mathrm{G}\\, R_\\mathrm{E}^3\\, (R_\\mathrm{E}\\simeq 6378\\,\\mathrm{km})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe last expression is convenient in practice because the dipole field on the surface of the Earth (at 1 \\(R_\\mathrm{E}\\)) varies in the range 0.3–0.6 G.\nOutside its source, the dipole field is a curl-free potential field \\(\\mathbf{B} = -\\nabla\\psi\\), where the scalar potential is given by \\[\n\\psi = -\\mathbf{k}_0\\cdot\\nabla\\frac{1}{r} = -k_0\\frac{\\sin\\lambda}{r^2}\n\\] yielding \\[\n\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{r^3}\\left[ 3(\\mathbf{k}_0\\cdot\\hat{r})\\hat{r} - \\mathbf{k}_0 \\right]\n\\]\nThe components of the magnetic field are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_r &= -\\frac{2k_0}{r^3}\\sin\\lambda \\\\\nB_\\lambda &= \\frac{k_0}{r^3}\\cos\\lambda \\\\\nB_\\phi &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and its magnitude is \\[\nB = \\frac{k_0}{r^3}\\left( 1+3\\sin^2\\lambda \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\nThe equation of a magnetic field line is \\[\nr = r_0\\cos^2\\lambda\n\\] where \\(r_0\\) is the distance where the field line crosses the equator. The length element of the magnetic field line element is \\[\n\\mathrm{d}s = \\left( \\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2\\mathrm{d}\\lambda^2 \\right)^{1/2} = r_0\\cos\\lambda \\left( 1+3\\sin^2\\lambda \\right)^{1/2} \\mathrm{d}\\lambda\n\\] This can be integrated in a closed form, yielding the length of the dipole field line \\(S_d\\) as a function of \\(r_0\\) \\[\nS_d \\approx 2.7603 r_0\n\\tag{22.1}\\]\nThe curvature radius \\(RC = |\\mathrm{d}^2\\mathbf{r}/\\mathrm{d}s^2|^{−1}\\) of the magnetic field is an important parameter for the motion of charged particles. For the dipole field the radius of curvature is \\[\nR_c(\\lambda) = \\frac{r_0}{3}\\cos\\lambda \\frac{\\left( 1+3\\sin^2\\lambda \\right)^{3/2}}{2-\\cos^2\\lambda}\n\\]\nAny dipole field line is determined by its (constant) longitude \\(\\phi_0\\) and the distance where the field line crosses the dipole equator. This distance is often given in terms of the L-parameter \\[\nL = r_0 / R_E\n\\tag{22.2}\\]\nFor a given L the corresponding field line reaches the surface of the Earth at the (dipole) latitude \\[\n\\lambda_e = \\arccos\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}}\n\\]\nFor example, L = 2 (the inner belt) intersects the surface at \\(\\lambda_e = 45^\\circ\\) , L = 4 (the heart of the outer belt) at \\(\\lambda_e = 60^\\circ\\) and L = 6.6 (the geostationary orbit) at \\(\\lambda_e = 67.1^\\circ\\).\nThe dipole field line length in Equation 22.1 was calculated from the dipole itself. Now we can calculate also the dipole field line length from a point on the surface to the surface on the opposite hemisphere to be \\[\nS_e \\approx (2.7755 L - 2.1747) R_E\n\\] which is a good approximation when \\(L\\gtrsim 2\\).\nThe field magnitude along a given field line as a function of latitude is \\[\nB(\\lambda) = \\left[ B_r(\\lambda)^2 + B_\\lambda(\\lambda)^2 \\right]^{1/2} = \\frac{k_0}{r_0^3}\\frac{(1+3\\sin^2\\lambda)^{1/2}}{\\cos^6\\lambda}\n\\]\nFor the Earth \\[\n\\frac{k_0}{r_0^3} = \\frac{0.3}{L}\\,\\mathrm{G} = \\frac{3\\times 10^{-5}}{L^3}\\,\\mathrm{T}\n\\]\nThe actual geomagnetic field has considerable deviations from the dipolar field because the dipole is not quite in the center of the Earth, the source is not a point, and the electric conductivity of the Earth is not uniform. The geomagnetic field is described by the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model, which is regularly updated to reflect the slow secular variations of the field, i.e., changes in timescales of years or longer.\n\n\n22.1.3 Current Systems\nThe Earth’s magnetosphere is the region where the near-Earth magnetic field controls the motion of charged particles. It is formed by the interaction between the geodipole and the solar wind. The deformation of the field, caused by the variable solar wind pressure, sets up time-dependent magnetospheric current systems that dominate deviations from the dipole field in the outer radiation belt and beyond.\nThe solar wind plasma cannot easily penetrate to the Earth’s magnetic field and the outer magnetosphere is essentially a cavity around which the solar wind flows. The cavity is bounded by a flow discontinuity called the magnetopause. The shape and location of the magnetopause is determined by the balance between the solar wind plasma pressure and the magnetospheric magnetic field pressure. The nose, or apex, of the magnetopause is, under average solar wind conditions, at the distance of about 10 \\(R_E\\) from the center of the Earth but can be pushed to the vicinity of the geostationary distance (6.6 \\(R_E\\)) during periods of large solar wind pressure. In the dayside the dipole field is compressed toward the Earth, whereas in the nightside the field is stretched to form a long magnetotail. The deviations from the curl-free dipole field correspond to electric current systems according to Ampère’s law \\(\\mathbf{J}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}/\\mu_0\\).\nFigure 22.1 is a sketch of the magnetosphere with the main large-scale magnetospheric current systems. Individual looks at different currents in detail are presented in Figure 22.4, Figure 22.5, and Figure 22.6, with more explanations in this review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.1: The magnetosphere and the large scale magnetospheric current systems.\n\n\n\nThe current system on the dayside magnetopause shielding the Earth’s magnetic field from the solar wind is known as the Chapman–Ferraro current (Figure 22.2). In the first approximation the Chapman–Ferraro current density \\(\\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm{CF}\\) can be expressed as \\[\n\\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{MS}}{B_\\mathrm{MS}^2}\\times\\nabla P_\\mathrm{dyn}\n\\tag{22.3}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{MS}\\) is the magnetospheric magnetic field and \\(P_\\mathrm{dyn}\\) the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. Because the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at the Earth’s orbit is only a few nanoteslas, the magnetopause current must shield the magnetospheric field to almost zero just outside the current layer. Consequently, the magnetic field immediately inside the magnetopause doubles: about one half comes from the Earth’s dipole and the second half from the magnetopause current. In plasma physics this is known as the diamagnetic current caused by the pressure gradient (Equation 8.56, Equation 8.58).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.2: The Chapman-Ferraro dayside magnetopause currents are shown as a green-shaded surface on a simple wire diagram of the magnetopause. The Earth is the small sphere at the axis origin, and the Sun is to the lower left.\n\n\n\nIf the plasma pressure is anisotropic, the current density perpendicular to the magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{J}_\\perp\\) in a static system can be written \\[\n\\mathbf{J}_\\perp = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\\times\\left[ \\nabla p_\\perp + (p_\\parallel - p_\\perp)\\frac{(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}}{B^2} \\right]\n\\tag{22.4}\\] where \\(p_\\parallel\\) and \\(p_\\perp\\) are plasma pressure, parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, respectively. Equation 22.4 can be simplified to Equation 22.3 in the isotropic case.\nThe Chapman–Ferraro model describes a teardrop-like closed magnetosphere that is compressed in the dayside and stretched in the nightside, but not very far. Since the 1960s spacecraft observations have shown that the nightside magnetosphere, the magnetotail, is very long, extending far beyond the orbit of the Moon. This requires a mechanism to transfer energy from the solar wind into the magnetosphere to keep up the current system that sustains the tail-like configuration.\nIn Figure 22.1, the overwhelming fraction of the magnetospheric volume consists of tail lobes, connected magnetically to the polar caps in the ionized upper atmosphere, known as the ionosphere. The polar caps are bounded by auroral ovals. Consequently, in the northern lobe the magnetic field points toward the Earth, in the southern away from the Earth. To maintain the lobe structure, there must be a current sheet between the lobes where the current points from dawn to dusk. This cross-tail current is embedded within the plasma sheet and closes around the tail lobes forming the nightside part of the the magnetopause current.\nThe cusp-like configurations of weak magnetic field above the polar regions known as polar cusps do not connect magnetically to magnetic poles, but instead to the southern and northern auroral ovals at noon, because the entire magnetic flux enclosed by the ovals is connected to the tail lobes. Tailward of the cusps the Chapman–Ferraro current and the tail magnetopause current smoothly merge with each other. Figure 22.1 also illustrates the westward flowing ring current (RC) and the magnetic field-aligned currents (FAC) connecting the magnetospheric currents to the horizontal ionospheric currents in auroral regions at an altitude of about 100 km. FACs are mainly carried by electrons. They were first suggested to explain the variations of magnetic field measured on the ground in the polar regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.3: The tail current with closure via return current on magnetopause shown in light blue on the wire diagram of the magnetopause, as in Figure 22.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.4: The symmetric ring current (eastward and westward, in brown and blue, respectively) including the cut ring currents on the dayside (in yellow). The viewing perspective is the same as in Figure 22.2 but now zoomed in closer to the Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.5: Region 1 field-aligned currents, shown as the red bands, including the two possible closure paths: directly to the magnetopause and via the far tail plasma sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.6: Region 2 field-aligned currents and partial ring current, shown in purple and the banana current, shown in orange. The view here is shifted to be from the evening sector.\n\n\n\nBased on the magnetosphere-ionosphere current continuity, the field-aligned current \\(J_\\parallel\\) (positive if flowing into the ionosphere) is related to the magnetic field and plasma pressure in the magnetosphere (Grad, 1964; Tverskoy, 1982; Vasyliunas, 1970) as (???) \\[\nJ_\\parallel = \\frac{B_i}{B_e}\\hat{b}\\cdot\\left( \\nabla W \\times \\nabla P \\right)\n\\tag{22.5}\\] where \\(W = \\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{B}\\) is the magnetic flux tube volume, \\(\\mathrm{d}s\\) is the element of magnetic field line length, \\(B\\) is the magnetic field along the field line and the integration is taken between the two conjugate points, \\(P\\) is the plasma pressure, \\(B_i\\) and \\(B_e\\) are the magnetic fields in the ionosphere and equatorial plane, respectively. The gradients are evaluated in the equatorial plane. The formation of a FAC requires the existence of a hot plasma pressure gradient along the isosurfaces of the magnetic flux tube volume W, azimuthal plasma pressure gradient. If the azimuthal gradient is directed outward indicating that the pressure peaks are not around midnight but close to dawn and dusk, Region 1 field-aligned current can be generated in the plasma sheet, as shown in Figure 22.5.\nThe magnetospheric current systems can have significant temporal variations, which makes the mathematical description of the magnetic field complicated. A common approach is to apply some of the various models developed by Nikolai Tsyganenko (Tsyganenko 2013).1\nFor illustrative purposes simpler models are sometimes useful. For example, the early time-independent model of Mead (1964) reduces in the magnetic equatorial \\((r, \\phi)\\) plane to \\[\nB(r,\\phi) = B_E\\left( \\frac{R_E}{r} \\right)^3 \\left[ 1 + \\frac{b_1}{B_E}\\left( \\frac{r}{R_E} \\right)^3 - \\frac{b_2}{B_E}\\left( \\frac{r}{R_E} \\right)^4 \\cos\\phi \\right]\n\\] where \\(B_E\\) is the equatorial dipole field on the surface of the Earth (approximately 30.4 µT = 30,400 nT) and φ is the longitude east of midnight. The \\(\\cos\\phi\\) term describes the azimuthal asymmetry due to the dayside compression and nightside stretching of the field. The coefficients \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) depend on the distance of the subsolar point of the magnetopause \\(R_s\\) (in units of \\(R_E\\)), which, in turn, depends on the upstream solar wind pressure \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_1 &= 25\\left( \\frac{10}{R_s} \\right)^3\\,\\mathrm{nT} \\\\\nb_2 &= 2.1\\left( \\frac{10}{R_s} \\right)^4\\,\\mathrm{nT}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis model is fairly accurate during quiet and moderately disturbed times at geocentric distances 1.5–7 \\(R_E\\).\n\n\n22.1.4 Geomagnetic Activity Indices\nThe intensity and variations of magnetospheric and ionospheric current systems are traditionally described in terms of geomagnetic activity indices. The indices are calculated from ground-based magnetometer measurements. As different indices describe different features of magnetospheric currents, there is no one-to-one correspondence between them. The choice of a particular index depends on physical processes being investigated.\nThe most widely used indices for global storm levels are Dst, Kp, and AE.\n\n22.1.4.1 Dst\nThe Dst index aims at measuring the intensity of the ring current. It is calculated once an hour as a weighted average of the deviation from the quiet level of the horizontal magnetic field component (H) measured at four low-latitude stations distributed around the globe. Geomagnetic storms are defined as periods of strongly negative Dst index, signalling enhanced westward the ring current. The more negative the Dst index is, the stronger is the storm. There is no canonical lower threshold for the magnetic perturbation beyond which the state of the magnetosphere is to be called a storm and identification of weak storms is often ambiguous. As an empirical classification, we call storms with Dst from –50 to –100 nT moderate, from –100 to –200 nT intense, and those with Dst &lt; −200 nT big. A similar 1-min index derived from a partly different set of six low-latitude stations (SYM–H) is also in use.\nDst has contributions from all currents in addition to the ring current. These include the magnetopause and cross-tail currents, as well as induced currents in the ground due to rapid temporal changes of ionospheric currents. Large solar wind pressure pushes the magnetopause closer to the Earth forcing the magnetopause current to increase to be able to shield a locally stronger geomagnetic field from the solar wind. The effect is strongest on the dayside where the magnetopause current flows in the direction opposite to the ring current. The pressure corrected Dst index can be defined as \\[\n\\mathrm{Dst}^\\ast = \\mathrm{Dst} - b\\sqrt{P_\\mathrm{dyn}} + c\n\\tag{22.6}\\] where \\(P_\\mathrm{dyn}\\) is the solar wind dynamic pressure and b and c are empirical parameters, whose exact values depend on the used statistical analysis methods, e.g., \\(b = 7.26\\,\\mathrm{nT}\\,\\mathrm{nPa}^{−1/2}\\) and \\(c = 11\\,\\mathrm{nT}\\) as determined by O’Brien and McPherron (2000).\nThe contribution from the dawn-to-dusk directed tail current to the Dst index is more difficult to estimate. During strong activity the cross-tail current intensifies and moves closer to the Earth, enhancing the nightside contribution to Dst. The estimates of this effect on Dst vary in the range 25–50%. Furthermore, fast temporal changes in the ionospheric currents induce strong localized currents in the ground, which may contribute up to 25% to the Dst index.\n\n\n22.1.4.2 Kp\nAnother widely used index is the planetary K index, Kp. Each magnetic observatory has its own K index and Kp is an average of K indices from 13 mid-latitude stations. It is a quasi-logarithmic range index expressed in a scale of one-thirds: 0, 0+, 1−, 1, 1+,…, 8+, 9−, 9. Kp is based on mid-latitude observations and thus more sensitive to high-latitude auroral current systems and to substorm activity than the Dst index. Kp is a 3-h index and does not reflect rapid changes in the magnetospheric currents.\n\n\n22.1.4.3 AE\nThe fastest variations in the current systems take place at auroral latitudes. To describe the strength of the auroral currents the auroral electrojet indices (AE) are commonly used. The standard AE index is calculated from 11 or 12 magnetometer stations located under the average auroral oval in the northern hemisphere. It is derived from the magnetic north component at each station by determining the envelope of the largest negative deviation from the quiet time background, called the AL index, and the largest positive deviation, called the AU index. The AE index itself is \\(\\mathrm{AE} = \\mathrm{AU} - \\mathrm{AL}\\) (all in nT). Thus AL is the measure of the strongest westward current in the auroral oval, AU is the measure of the strongest eastward current, and AE characterizes the total electrojet activity. AE, AU, AL are typically given with 1-min time resolution.\nAs the auroral electrojets flow at the altitude of about 100 km, their magnetic deviations on the ground are much larger than those caused by the ring current. For example, during typical substorm activations AE is in the range 200–400 nT and can during strong storms exceed 2000 nT, whereas the equatorial Dst perturbations exceed −200 nT only during the strongest storms.",

    "text": "22.2 Particles\nTypical densities of the unperturbed solar wind at 1 AU extend from about \\(3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\) in the fast (\\(\\sim 750\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\)) to about \\(10\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\) in the slow (\\(\\sim 350\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\)) solar wind, again with large deviations.\n\n22.2.1 Outer Magnetosphere\nThe outer magnetosphere can be considered to begin at distances of about 7–8 \\(R_E\\) where the nightside magnetic field becomes increasingly stretched. Table 22.1 summarizes typical plasma parameters in the mid-tail region, at about \\(X = -20\\, R_E\\) from the Earth. Here \\(X\\) is the Earth-centered coordinate along the Earth–Sun line, positive toward the Sun. The tail lobes are almost empty, particle number densities being of the order of 0.01 \\(\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\). The central plasma sheet where the cross-tail current is embedded (Figure 22.1) is, in turn, a region of hot high-density plasma. It is surrounded by the plasma sheet boundary layer with density and temperature intermediate to values in the central plasma sheet and tail lobes. The field lines of the boundary layer connect to the poleward edge of the auroral oval. The actual numbers differ considerably from the typical values under changing solar wind conditions and, in particular, during strong magnetospheric disturbances.\n\n\n\nTable 22.1: Typical values of plasma parameters in the mid-tail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetosheath\nTail lobe\nPlasma sheet boundary\nCentral plasma sheet\n\n\n\n\n\\(n(\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})\\)\n8\n0.01\n0.1\n0.3\n\n\n\\(T_i(\\mathrm{eV})\\)\n150\n300\n1000\n4200\n\n\n\\(T_e(\\mathrm{eV})\\)\n25\n50\n150\n600\n\n\n\\(B(\\mathrm{nT})\\)\n15\n20\n20\n10\n\n\n\\(\\beta\\)\n2.5\n0.0003\n0.1\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 22.1 also includes typical parameters in the magnetosheath at the same X-coordinate. The magnetosheath consists of solar wind plasma that has been compressed and heated by the Earth’s bow shock. It has higher density and lower temperature than observed in the outer magnetosphere. Table 22.1 shows that, while the magnetic field magnitude is rather similar in all regions shown, plasma beta (the ratio between the kinetic and magnetic field pressures), is a useful parameter to distinguish between different regions.\n\n\n22.2.2 Inner Magnetosphere\nThe inner magnetosphere is the region where the magnetic field is quasi-dipolar. It is populated by different spatially overlapping particle species with different origins and widely different energies: the ring current, the radiation belts and the plasmasphere (Chapter 24). The ring current and radiation belts consist mainly of trapped particles in the quasi-dipolar field drifting due to magnetic field gradient and curvature effects around the Earth, whereas the motion and spatial extent of plasmaspheric plasma is mostly influenced by the corotation and convection electric fields.\nThe ring current arises from the azimuthal drift of energetic charged particles around the Earth; positively charged particles drifting toward the west and electrons toward the east. Basically all drifting particles contribute to the ring current. The drift currents are proportional to the energy density of the particles and the main ring current carriers are positive ions in the energy range 10–200 keV, whose fluxes are much larger than those of the higher-energy radiation belt particles. The ring current flows at geocentric distances 3–8 \\(R_E\\), and peaks at about 3–4 \\(R_E\\). At the earthward edge of the ring current the negative pressure gradient introduces a local eastward diamagnetic current, but the net current remains westward.\nDuring magnetospheric activity the role of the ionosphere as the plasma source of ring current enhances, increasing the relative abundance of oxygen (\\(\\mathrm{O}^+\\)) and helium (\\(\\mathrm{He}^+\\)) ions in the magnetosphere. As a result a significant fraction of ring current can at times be carried by oxygen ions of atmospheric origin. The heavy-ion content furthermore modifies the properties of plasma waves in the inner magnetosphere, which has consequences on the wave–particle interactions with the radiation belt electrons.\nThe plasmasphere is the innermost part of the magnetosphere. It consists of cold (\\(\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\)) and dense (\\(\\gtrsim 10^3\\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\)) plasma of ionospheric origin. The existence of the plasmasphere was already known before the spaceflight era based on the propagation characteristics of lightning-generated and man-made very low-frequency (VLF) waves. The plasmasphere has a relatively clear outer edge, the plasmapause, where the proton density drops several orders of magnitude. The location and structure of the plasmapause vary considerably as a function of magnetic activity (Figure 22.7). During magnetospheric quiescence the density decreases smoothly at distances from 4–6 \\(R_E\\), whereas during strong activity the plasmapause is steeper and pushed closer to the Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.7: Plasma density in the night sector organized by the activity index Kp. Kp &lt; 1+ corresponds to a very quiet magnetosphere, whereas Kp = 4-5 indicates a significant activity level, although not yet a big magnetic storm. The L-shell is defined in Equation 22.2. [Chappell (1972)]\n\n\n\nThe location of the plasmapause is determined by the interplay between the sunward convection of plasma sheet particles and the plasmaspheric plasma corotating with the Earth. By adding the convective and corotational electric fields to the guiding center motion of charged particles we find that an outward bulge called plasmaspheric plume develops on the duskside around 18 h magnetic local time (MLT). Plasmaspheric plumes are most common and pronounced during geomagnetic storms and substorms, but they can exist also during quiet conditions (e.g., Moldwin+ 2016). During geomagnetic storms the plume can expand out to geostationary orbit and bend toward earlier MLT.\nFigure 24.3 shows global observations of the plasmasphere taken by the EUV instrument onboard the IMAGE satellite before and after a moderate geomagnetic storm in June 2000. Before the storm the plasmasphere was more or less symmetric. After the storm the plasmasphere was significantly eroded leaving a plume extending from the dusk toward the dayside magnetopause. When traversing the plume, the trapped radiation belt electrons, otherwise outside the plasmapause, encounter a colder and higher-density plasma with plasma wave environment similar to the plasmasphere proper. Consequently, the influence of the plasmasphere on radiation belt particles extends beyond its nominal boundary depicted in Figure 22.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.8: Plasmapheric plume and plasmaspheric erosion as observed by the IMAGE EUV instrument. The picture is taken from above the northern hemisphere and the Sun is to the right. (Goldstein+2004)\n\n\n\nThe plasma parameters in the plasmasphere, in the plume and at the plasmapause are critical to the generation and propagation of plasma waves that, in turn, interact with the energetic particles in the ring current and radiation belts. Thus, the coldest and the hottest components of the inner magnetosphere are intimately coupled to each other through wave–particle interactions.\n\n\n22.2.3 Cosmic Rays\nIn addition to ion and electron radiation belts another important component of corpuscular radiation in the near-Earth space consists of cosmic rays. The kinetic energies of a large fraction of cosmic ray particles are so large that the geomagnetic field cannot trap them. Instead, the particles traverse through the Earth’s magnetosphere without much deflection of their trajectories. Some of them hit the atmosphere interacting with nuclei of atmospheric atoms and molecules causing showers of elementary particles being possible to detect on ground. Those with highest energies can penetrate all the way to the ground.\nThe spectrum of cosmic ray ions at energies below about \\(10^{15}\\) eV per nucleon in the near-Earth space has three main components:\n\nGalactic cosmic rays (GCR), whose spectrum peaks at energies above 100 MeV per nucleon, are most likely accelerated by supernova remnant shock waves in our galaxy.\nSolar cosmic rays (SCR) are accelerated by coronal and interplanetary shocks related to solar eruptions. Their energies are mostly below 100 MeV per nucleon and a fraction of them can become trapped in the inner radiation belt.\nAnomalous cosmic rays (ACR) are ions of solar origin captured and accelerated by the heliospheric termination shock, where the supersonic solar wind becomes subsonic before encountering the interstellar plasma, or in the heliosheath outside the heliopause. Some of the ions are injected back toward the Sun. Near the Earth the ACR spectrum peaks at about 10 MeV per nucleon and thus the particles can become trapped in the geomagnetic field.\n\nAlthough the galactic cosmic rays cannot directly be trapped into the radiation belts, they contribute indirectly to the inner belt composition through the Cosmic Ray Albedo Neutron Decay (GRAND) mechanism. The cosmic ray bombardment of the atmosphere produces neutrons that move in all directions. Although the average neutron lifetime is 14 min 38 s, during which a multi-MeV neutron either hits the Earth or escapes far away from the magnetosphere, a small fraction of them decay to protons while still in the inner magnetosphere and may become trapped in the inner radiation belt.\nBelow about 10 GeV GCR and ACR fluxes are modulated by the 11- and 22-year solar cycles, so they provide quasi-stationary background radiation in the timescales of radiation belt observations. The arrivals of SCRs are, in turn, transient phenomena related to solar flares and coronal mass ejections.\nThe cosmic ray electrons also have galactic and solar components. Furthermore, the magnetosphere of Jupiter accelerates high-energy electrons escaping to the interplanetary space. These Jovian electrons can be observed near the Earth at intervals of about 13 months when the Earth and Jupiter are connected by the IMF.\nSupernova shock waves are the most likely sources of the accelerated GCR electrons, whereas in the acceleration of SCR and Jovian electrons also other mechanisms besides shock acceleration are important, in particular inductive electric fields associated with magnetic reconnection in solar flares and the Jovian magnetosphere.\nThe acceleration and identity of the observed very highest-energy cosmic rays up to about \\(3\\times 10^{20}\\) eV remain enigmatic. It should not be possible to observe protons with energies higher than \\(6\\times 10^{19}\\) eV, known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin cutoff, unless they are accelerated not too far from the observing site. Above the cutoff the interaction of protons with the blue-shifted cosmic microwave background produces pions that carry away the excessive energy. It is possible that the highest-energy particles are nuclei of heavier elements. This is, for the time being, an open question.",

    "section": "22.3 Magnetospheric Dynamics",
    "text": "22.3 Magnetospheric Dynamics\nStrong solar wind forcing drives storms and more intermittent substorms in the magnetosphere. They are primarily caused by various large-scale heliospheric structures such as interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections (CMEs/ICMEs)2, stream interaction regions (SIRs) of slow and fast solar wind flows, and fast solar wind supporting Alfvénic fluctuations. ICMEs are often preceded by interplanetary fast forward shocks and turbulent sheath regions between the shock and the ejecta, which all create their distinct responses in the magnetosphere. Because fast solar wind streams originate from coronal holes, which can persist over several solar rotations, the slow and fast stream pattern repeats in 27-day intervals and SIRs are often called co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs). However, stream interaction region is a physically more descriptive term. SIRs may gradually evolve to become bounded by shocks, but fully developed SIR shocks are only seldom observed sunward of the Earth’s orbit. The duration of these large-scale heliospheric structures near the orbit of the Earth varies from a few hours to days. On average, the passage of a sheath region past the Earth takes 8–9 h and the passage of an ICME or SIR about 1 day. The fast streams typically influence the Earth’s environment for several days.\n\n22.3.1 Magnetospheric Convection\nMagnetospheric plasma is in a continuous large-scale advective motion, which in this context is, somewhat inaccurately, called magnetospheric convection. The convection is most directly observable in the polar ionosphere, where the plasma flows from the dayside across the polar cap to the nightside and turns back to the dayside through the morning and evening sector auroral region. The non-resistive ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is a fairly accurate description of the large-scale plasma motion above the resistive ionosphere. In ideal MHD the magnetic field lines are electric equipotentials and the electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and plasma velocity \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) are related to each other through the simple relation \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{V}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\nConsequently, the observable convective motion, or alternatively the electric potential, in the ionosphere can be mapped along the magnetic field lines to plasma motion in the tail lobes and the plasma sheet. As the electric field in the tail plasma sheet points from dawn to dusk and the magnetic field to the north, the convection brings plasma particles from the nightside plasma sheet toward the Earth where a fraction of them become carriers of the ring current and form the source population for the radiation belts.\nIn ideal MHD the plasma and the magnetic field lines are said to be frozen-in to each other. This means that two plasma elements that are connected by a magnetic field line remain so when plasma flows from one place to another. It is convenient to illustrate the motion with moving field lines, although the magnetic field lines are not physical entities and their motion is just a convenient metaphor. A more physical description is that the magnetic field evolves in space and time such that the plasma elements maintain their magnetic connection.\nThe convection is sustained by solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere. The input is weakest, but yet finite, when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) points toward the north, and is enhanced during southward pointing IMF. If the magnetopause were fully closed, plasma would circulate inside the magnetosphere so that the magnetic flux tubes crossing the polar cap from dayside to nightside would reach to the outer boundary of the magnetosphere where some type of viscous interaction with the anti-sunward solar wind flow would be needed to maintain the circulation. The classical (collisional) viscosity on the magnetopause is vanishingly small, but finite gyro radius effects and wave–particle interactions give rise to some level of anomalous viscosity3. It is estimated to provide about 10% of the momentum transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere.\nThe magnetosphere is, however, not fully closed. In the same year, when Axford and Hines presented their viscous interaction model, Dungey (1961) explained the convection in terms of magnetic reconnection. The Dungey cycle begins with a violation of the frozen-in condition at the dayside magnetopause current sheet. A magnetic field line in the solar wind is cut and reconnected with a terrestrial field line. Reconnection is most efficient for oppositely directed magnetic fields, as is the case in the dayside equatorial plane when the IMF points southward, but remains finite under other orientations. Subsequent to the dayside reconnection the solar wind flow drags the newly-connected field line to the nightside and the part of the field line that is inside the magnetosphere becomes a tail lobe field line. Consequently, an increasing amount of magnetic flux is piling up in the lobes. At some distance far in the tail the oppositely directed field lines in the northern and southern lobes reconnect again across the cross-tail current layer. At this point the ionospheric end of the field line has reached the auroral oval near local midnight. Now the earthward outflow from the reconnection site in the tail drags the newly-closed field line toward the Earth. The return flow cannot penetrate to the plasmasphere corotating with the Earth and the convective flow must proceed via the dawn and dusk sectors around the Earth to the dayside. In the ionosphere the flow returns toward the dayside along the dawnside and duskside auroral oval. Once approaching the dayside magnetopause, the magnetospheric plasma provides the inflow to the dayside reconnection inside of the magnetopause. Note that the resistive ionosphere breaks the frozen-in condition of ideal MHD and it is not reasonable to use the picture of moving field lines in the atmosphere.\nThe increase in the tail lobe magnetic flux and strengthening of plasma convection inside the magnetosphere during southward IMF have a strong observational basis. Calculating the east-west component of the motion-induced solar wind electric field (\\(E = V\\, B_\\mathrm{south}\\)) incident on the magnetopause and estimating the corresponding potential drop over the magnetosphere, some 10% of the solar wind electric field is estimated to “penetrate” into the magnetosphere as the dawn-to-dusk directed convection electric field. Note that \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{V}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) is not a causal relationship indicating whether it is the electric field that drives the magnetospheric convection, or convection that gives rise to the motion-induced electric field. The ultimate driver of the circulation is the solar wind forcing on the magnetosphere.\nThe plasma circulation is not as smooth as the above discussion may suggest. If the reconnection rates at the dayside magnetopause and nightside current sheet balance each other, a steady-state convection can, indeed, arise. This is, however, seldom the case since the changes in the driving solar wind and in the magnetospheric response are faster than the magnetospheric circulation timescale of a few hours. Reconnection may cause significant erosion of the dayside magnetospheric magnetic field placing the magnetopause closer to the Earth than a simple pressure balance consideration would indicate. The changing magnetic flux in the tail lobes causes expansion and contraction of the polar caps affecting the size and shape of the auroral ovals.\nFurthermore, the convection in the plasma sheet has been found to consist of intermittent high-speed bursty bulk flows (BBF) with almost stagnant plasma in between (Angelopoulos et al. 1992). It is noteworthy that while BBFs are more frequent during high auroral activity, they also appear during auroral quiescence. BBFs have been estimated to be the primary mechanism of earthward mass and energy transport in regions where they have been observed. Thus the high-latitude convection observed in the ionosphere corresponds to an average of the BBFs and slower background flows in the outer magnetosphere.\n\n\n22.3.2 Geomagnetic Storms\nAs illustrated in Figure 22.9, the storms are periods of most dynamic evolution of radiation belts. They often, but not always, commence with a significant positive deviation in the horizontal component of the magnetic field (H) measured on the ground (Figure 22.10), called storm sudden commencement (SSC). An SSC is a signature of an ICME-driven shock and the associated pressure pulse arriving at the Earth’s magnetopause. SSCs are also observed during pressure pulses related to SIRs or to ICMEs that are not sufficiently fast to drive a shock in the solar wind but still disturb and pile-up the solar wind ahead of them. If the solar wind parameters are known, the pressure effect can be removed from the Dst index as given by Equation 22.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.9: Outer radiation belt response to solar and magnetospheric activity from the SAMPEX satellite and Van Allen Probes observations over a period of more than two solar cycles. The uppermost panel shows 27-day window-averaged relativistic (&gt;2 MeV) electron fluxes at geostationary orbit, the second panel the monthly minimum of the Dst index, and the third panel the yearly window-averaged sunspot number (black) and weekly window-averaged solar wind speed (red). The spectrogram in the lowest panel is a composite of 27-day window-averaged SAMPEX observations of relativistic (∼2 MeV) electron fluxes until September 2012 and Van Allen Probes REPT observations of (∼2.1 MeV) electron fluxes after 5 September 2012. The shift from SAMPEX to Van Allen Probes is visible in the change of sensitivity to particle flux in the slot region (Li et al. 2017)\n\n\n\nStorms in the magnetosphere can also be driven by low-speed ICMEs and SIRs without a significant pressure pulse. SIR-driven storms occur if the field fluctuations have sufficiently long periods of strong enough southward magnetic field to sustain global convention electric field to enhance the ring current. Thus there are storms without a clear SSC signature in the Dst index. On the other hand, a shock wave hitting the magnetopause is not always followed by a geomagnetic storm, in particular, if the IMF points dominantly toward the north during the following solar wind structure. In such cases the positive deviation in the magnetograms is called a sudden impulse (SI), after which the Dst index returns close to its background level with small temporal variations only. If the dynamic pressure remains at enhanced level, Dst can maintain positive deviation for some period.\nAfter the SSC an initial phase of the storm begins. It is characterized by a positive deviation of Dst, typically a few tens of nT. The initial phase is caused by a combination of predominantly northward IMF and high dynamic pressure. The phase can have very different durations depending on the type and structure of the solar wind driver. It can be very brief if the storm is driven by an ICME with a southward magnetic field following immediately a sheath with predominantly southward magnetic field. In such a case the storm main phase, which is a period characterized by a rapid decrease of the H component of the equatorial magnetic field, starts as soon as the energy transfer into the magnetosphere has become strong enough. If the sheath has a predominantly northward IMF, the main phase will not begin until a southward field of the ejecta enhances reconnection on the dayside magnetopause.\nIf there is no southward IMF either in the sheath or in the ICME, no regular global storm is expected to take place. However, pressure pulses/shocks followed by northward IMF can cause significant consequences to the radiation belt environment, as they can shake and compress the magnetosphere strongly and trigger a sequence of substorms (Section 22.3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.10: The horizontal component (H) of the magnetic field measured at four low-latitude stations during a magnetic storm on 15 May 1997. An ICME-driven solar wind shock hit the magnetosphere on 15 May at about 02 UT causing the storm sudden commencement which is indicated by a sudden positive jump of the H component at all stations (thick blue line). The main phase of the storm started after 06 UT as indicated by the strong negative deviation in the H component. The solid vertical lines give the UT midnight and the tick-marks on the horizontal axis are given for each 3 h.\n\n\n\nDuring the storm main phase, the enhanced energy input from the solar wind leads to energization and increase of the number of ring current carriers in the inner magnetosphere, as the enhanced magnetospheric convection transports an increasing amount of charged particles from the tail to the ring current region. Here substorms, discussed below, have important contribution, as they inject fresh particles from the near-Earth tail. The ring current enhancement is typically asymmetric because not all current carrying ions are on closed drift paths but a significant fraction of them passes the Earth on the evening side and continue toward the dayside magnetopause. This is illustrated in Figure 22.10 where the Honolulu and Kakioka magnetometers show the steepest main phase development when these stations were in the dusk side of the globe.\nWhen energy input from the solar wind ceases, the energetic ring current ions are lost faster than fresh ones are supplemented from the tail. The Dst index starts to return toward the background level. This phase is called the recovery phase. It is usually much longer than the main phase, because the dominating loss processes of the ring current carriers: charge exchange with the low-energy neutral atoms of the Earth’s exosphere, wave–particle interactions, and Coulomb collisions, are slower than the rapid increase of the current during the main phase. As ICMEs last typically 1 day, storms driven by ICMEs trailed by a slow wind tend to have relatively short recovery phases, whereas storms driven by SIRs and ICMEs followed by a fast stream can have much longer recovery phases. This is because Alfvénic fluctuations, i.e., large-amplitude MHD Alfvén waves, in fast streams interacting with the magnetospheric boundary lead to triggering substorms, which inject particles to the inner magnetosphere. This can keep the ring current populated with fresh particles up to or longer than a week. The ring current development can also be more complex, often resulting in multi-step enhancement of Dst or events where Dst does not recover to quiet-time level between relatively closely-spaced intensifications. This typically occurs when both sheath and ICME ejecta carry southward field or when the Earth is impacted by multiple interacting ICMEs.\n\n\n22.3.3 Substorms\nMagnetospheric substorm is a transient solar-wind energy storage and release process within the magnetotail. It can inject fresh particles in the energy range from tens to a few hundred keV from the tail plasma sheet into the inner magnetosphere. After being injected to the quasi-dipolar magnetosphere, charged particles start to drift around the Earth, contributing to the ring current and radiation belt populations. The injections have a twofold role: They provide particles to be accelerated to high energies. Simultaneously the injected electrons and protons drive waves that can lead to both acceleration and loss of radiation belt electrons and ring current carriers.\nMagnetospheric substorms result from piling of tail lobe magnetic flux in the near-to-mid-tail region during enhanced convection. The details of the substorm cycle are still debated after more than half a century of research. Observationally it is clear that substorms encompass global configurational changes in the magnetosphere, namely the stretching of the near-Earth nightside magnetic field and related thinning of the plasma sheet during the flux pile-up (substorm growth phase), followed by a relatively rapid return of the near-Earth field toward a dipolar shape (expansion phase), and a slower return to a quiet-time stretched configuration associated with thickening of the plasma sheet (recovery phase). A substorm cycle typically lasts 2–3 h. The strongest activity occurs following the onset of the expansion phase: The cross-tail current in the near-Earth tail disrupts and couples to the polar region ionospheric currents through magnetic field-aligned currents forming the so-called substorm current wedge. This leads to intense precipitation of magnetospheric particles causing the most fascinating auroral displays. During geomagnetic storms the substorm cycle may not be equally well-defined. For example, a new growth phase may begin and the onset of the next expansion may follow soon after the previous expansion phase.\nA widely used, though not the only, description of the substorm cycle is the so-called near-Earth neutral line model (NENL model, for a review, see Baker et al. (1996)). In the model the current sheet is pinched off by a new magnetic reconnection neutral line once enough flux has piled up in the tail. The new neutral line forms somewhere at distances of 8–30 \\(R_E\\) from the Earth, which is much closer to the Earth than the far-tail neutral line of the Dungey cycle. Earthward of the neutral line plasma is pushed rapidly toward the Earth. Tailward of the neutral line plasma flows tailward, and together with the far-tail neutral line, a tailward moving structure called plasmoid forms. Sometimes recurrent substorm onsets can create a chain of plasmoids. While it is common to illustrate the plasmoid formation using two-dimensional cartoons in the noon–midnight meridional plane, the three-dimensional evolution of the substorm process in the magnetotail is far more complex. In reality a plasmoid is a magnetic flux rope whose two-dimensional cut looks like a closed loop of magnetic field around a magnetic null point.\nAs pointed out in Section 22.3.2, the plasma flow in the central plasma sheet is not quite smooth and a significant fraction of energy and mass transport takes place as bursty bulk flows (BBFs). The BBFs are thought to be associated with localized reconnection events in the plasma sheet roughly at the same distances from the Earth as the reconnection line of the NENL model. They create small flux tubes called dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs). The name derives from their enhanced northward magnetic field component \\(B_z\\) corresponding to a more dipole-like state of the geomagnetic field compared to a more stretched configuration. Once created, DFBs surge toward the Earth due to the force caused by magnetic curvature tension in the fluid picture. They are preceded by sharp increases of \\(B_z\\) called dipolarization fronts. DFBs are also associated with large azimuthal electric fields, up to several \\(\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\), which are capable of accelerating charged particles to high energies. Whether the braking of the bursty bulk flows and coalescence of dipolarization fronts closer to the Earth cause the formation of the substorm current wedge, or not, is a controversial issue.\nThe NENL model has been challenged by the common observation that the auroral substorm activation starts at the most equatorward arc and expands thereafter poleward. Another model proposed is the current disruption (CD) model, which is built upon plasma instabilities. In the CD model, a three-dimensional plasma instability grows first near the Earth in the transition region between the stretched tail and the dipolar inner magnetosphere. This instability drives steepening waves, leading to current disruption as the tail current cannot be sustained within a strongly oscillating geometry. The current disruption then launches tailward-propagating waves, which later trigger reconnection, plasmoid and fast flows. An easy way to think about these two models is that NENL is “outside-in”, while CD is “inside-out”. As both the current disruption and the plasma release from reconnection occur in only a few minutes, albeit roughly 100,000 km apart, it is challenging to uncover why and how the current disruption and plasmoid ejection take place. Setting aside the debate between competing explanations, what is essential is that the substorm expansions dipolarize the tail magnetic field configuration having been stretched during the growth phase and inject fresh particles into the inner magnetosphere. The particle injections can be observed as dispersionless, meaning that injected particles arrive to the observing spacecraft simultaneously at all energies, or dispersive when particles of higher energies arrive before those of lower energies. Because the dispersion arises from energy-dependent gradient and curvature drifts of the particles, a dispersionless injection suggests that the acceleration occurs relatively close to the observing spacecraft, whereas dispersive arrival indicates acceleration further away from the observation when the particle distribution has had time to develop dispersion due to energy-dependent drift motion.\nDispersionless substorm injections are typically observed close to the midnight sector at geostationary orbit (6.6 \\(R_E\\)) and beyond, but have been found all the way down to about 4 \\(R_E\\) (Friedel, Korth, and Kremser 1996). The injection sites move earthward as the substorm progresses and are also controlled by geomagnetic activity, although the extent of the dispersionless region is unclear, both in local time and radial directions. Neither have the details of acceleration of the injected particles been fully resolved. It has been suggested to be related both to betatron and Fermi acceleration associated with earthward moving dipolarization fronts. Another important aspect of dipolarization fronts for radiation belts is their braking close to Earth, which can launch magnetosonic waves that can effectively interact with radiation belt electrons.",

    "text": "22.4 ULF Waves\nUltra-low frequency (ULF) waves refer to waves within frequency range [0.001, 10] Hz. The name does not tell us anything about their physical origin, but simply observational fact. At Earth’s magnetosphere, this frequency range overlaps largely with the MHD waves. This is the reason why early pioneers in space physics relied on MHD theory for large spatial and temporal scales to explain the physics behind these waves, albeit some deviations and deficiencies which require more refined models such as the Vlasov description. ULF waves permeate the near-Earth plasma environment and play an important role in its dynamics, for example in transferring energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere or accelerating electrons in the Earth’s radiation belts.\nULF waves were originally called micropulsations or magnetic pulsations since they were first observed by ground magnetometers. ULF pulsations are classified into two types: pulsations continuous (Pc) and pulsations irregular (Pi) with several subclasses (Pc1–5 and Pi1–2) according to their frequencies and durations. The division is based on their physical and morphological properties, and the boundaries are not strict.\n\n\n\nNotation\nPeriod Range [s]\nProperty\n\n\n\n\nPc1\n0.2 - 5\nEMIC\n\n\nPc2\n5 - 10\nEMIC, Mirror\n\n\nPc3\n10 - 45\nForeshock, FLR, Mirror\n\n\nPc4\n45 - 150\nFLR\n\n\nPc5\n150 - 600\nSW, FLR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPi1\n1 - 40\n\n\n\nPi2\n40 - 150\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to polarization, field line resonant ULF waves can be categorized into three modes: compressional (\\(\\Delta B_\\parallel,\\, \\Delta E_\\phi\\))4, poloidal (\\(\\Delta B_r,\\, \\Delta E_\\phi\\)), and toroidal (\\(\\Delta B_\\phi,\\, \\Delta E_r\\)). Here, \\(B_r\\) (\\(E_r\\)), \\(B_\\parallel\\), and \\(B_\\phi\\) (\\(E_\\phi\\)) are the radial, parallel (or compressional), and azimuthal components in the local magnetic field system, respectively. Referring to the basic MHD theory, the compressional modes are fast modes, whereas the poloidal and toriodal modes are Alfvén modes. The perturbed EM fields are related by \\(\\mathbf{B}_1 = \\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{E}_1\\). Think of a closed field line near the equatorial plane inside the magnetosphere: if the wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) is along the field line, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{k} = (0,0,k_z)\\), then there will be two cases for the EM field: poloidal where \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) in \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) in \\(\\hat{r}\\) and toroidal where \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) in \\(\\hat{r}\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) in \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\). If the wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) is perpendicular to the field line, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, 0, 0)\\), since there is no \\(E_\\parallel\\) in MHD, we only have one option \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) in \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) in \\(\\hat{z}\\). A phase shift is allowed, and actually in real observations (e.g. THEMIS) it is rare that you can find B and E changing in-phase. These classifications are summarised in Table 16.1.\n\n22.4.1 Pc1 & Pc2\n\nUsually observed in the noon-afternoon MLT sector, easily detectable when following sudden impulses (SI) produced by sudden changes in the pressure of the solar wind plasma.\nA sudden compression of the magnetosphere by increased solar wind pressure causes maximum distortion of the quiet magnetospheric plasma near noon at high latitudes. It is on the fieldlines which thread this disturbed plasma that one is most likely to witness ULF emissions.\nConversely, as suggested by Hirasawa (1981) sudden rarefactions of the magnetosphere would be expected to quench ULF wave growth by reducing the anisotropy and \\(\\beta\\) of the plasma. (INTERESTING ONE, SHOULD CHECK AT SOMETIME!)\nDelay of 1-3 mins between the occurance of SI and the onset of the ULF emission (ground-based magnetometers)[^growth_rate]\nDrive the trapped proton radiation, greatly enhanced eV energy range protons along the B field, and energization of keV range protons caused by betatron acceleration (Arnoldy et al. 2005).\n\nAt Earth, Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are typically observed in Pc1 and Pc2 range. In the outer radiation belt, the frequency typically ranges between 0.1 to 5 Hz. The preferential region of occurrence of EMIC waves is known to be the afternoon magnetic local time (MLT) sector from ∼12:00 to ∼18:00 MLT in the region near the plasmapause and the plasmaspheric plume.\nEMIC waves are normally excited by a temperature anisotropic (\\(T_\\perp &gt; T_\\parallel\\)) distribution of hot (\\(\\sim 1-100\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\)) ions. They are preferentially generated in regions where hot anisotropic ions and cold dense plasma populations spatially overlap (Figure 22.11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.11: Schematic sketch of chorus/EMIC wave excitation regions, denoted by dots, on the noon-midnight meridian plane.\n\n\n\nThe excited EMIC waves can result in the energization and loss of magnetospheric particles. Through resonant wave-particle interactions, EMIC waves are able to accelerate cold ions into the thermal (\\(\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 1\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\)) energy range in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, and cause the pitch angle scattering loss of hot ions in the ring current. Particularly, EMIC waves can also resonantly interact with relativistic electrons and result in pitch angle scattering of the electrons.\nNewly excited EMIC waves are often transverse and left-hand polarized, consistent with the direction of ion gyration in the magnetic field (well, no surprise). After being generated, EMIC waves can be guided along the magnetic field lines and propagate from the source region to other magnetic latitudes. Spacecraft measurements have shown that EMIC wave propagation is almost exclusively away from the equator at latitudes greater than about \\(11^\\circ\\), with minimal reflection at the ionosphere.\nSome waves may even experience a polarization reversal where the wave frequency \\(f\\) is equal to the crossover frequency \\(f_{co}\\) during their higher-latitude propagation and then be reflected where \\(f\\) equals the bi-ion hybrid frequency \\(f_{bi}\\) at an even higher latitude. As a result, their polarization is crossed over from a left-hand to a right-hand or linear mode. These waves could undergo multiple equatorial crossings along magnetic flux tubes without a large radial or azimuthal drift. Because of their successive passes through the equatorial wave growth region, the waves are expected to be drastically amplified by continuing to obtain energy from the energetic protons. Nevertheless, Horne and Thorne argued that in the absence of density gradients, significant wave amplifications can only occur on the first equatorial pass because wave normal angles become large after the initial pass; wave damping by thermal heavy ions also makes it impossible for the same EMIC wave packet to bounce through its source region multiple times.\nMirror Instability & Ion Cyclotron Instability\nAlready, early observations in the 1970s have shown that the magnetosheath is populated by intense magnetic field fluctuations at time sclaes from 1 s to 10 s of seconds. Later research based primarily on data from ISEE and AMPTE satellites has shown that the mirror mode waves (Section 14.2) and kinetic Alfvén ion cyclotron (AIC) waves (i.e. EMIC waves) constitute a large majority of magnetosheath ULF waves:\n\nAIC/EMIC are found predominantly near the bow shock and in the plasma depletion layer5 (Song, Russell, and Gary 1994; Hubert et al. 1998).\nMirror mode waves dominate in the central and downstream magnetosheath but can occur immediately downstream of quasi-perpendicular shocks too. (Hubert et al. 1989)\nULF waves are generally stronger in the dayside magnetosheath.\nMore frequency EMIC wave occurrence during quasi-parallel shocks.\n\nThe ion cyclotron instability responsible for the generation of AIC waves often grows under the same conditions as the mirror instability and in the linear approximation should dominate in lower \\(\\beta\\) plasmas. The mirror instability, on the other hand, should dominate in high ion \\(\\beta\\) plasmas (Lacombe and Belmont 1995). Since the initial confirmation of the existence of mirror modes in the Earth’s magnetosheath, they have been observed throughout the heliosphere. A long-standing puzzle in space plasmas is the fact that mirror modes are often the dominant coherent magnetic structures even for low \\(\\beta\\) plasmas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.12: Mirror mode waves vs. EMIC waves in the magnetosphere.\n\n\n\nPeople tried to find an answer to this puzzle. A bunch of studies in late 1980s and early 1990s (e.g. [Gary+]) argued that the presence of \\(\\text{He}^{++}\\) tends to increase the EMIC threshold while the mirror mode growth is less affected by the presence of \\(\\text{He}^{++}\\) ions. Yoshiharu Omura and his student Shoji presented another possibility in 2009 with hybrid PIC simulations that even though EMIC modes have higher linear growth rate, they saturates an an earlier stage than the mirror modes, especially in higher dimensions (by comparing 2D and 3D results), so that mirror mode waves can gain more free energy from temperature anisotropy.\n\n\n22.4.2 Pc3 & Pc4\nAs already noted above, in the beginning when people proposed the ULF wave Pc divisions, many underlying physics are still unclear. The boundaries are chosen based on the observation data back then and does not necessarily contain any physical meaning.\nULF waves in the Pc3 range, with periods between 10-45 s, are a common feature of the dayside magnetosphere, where they are frequently observed both by spacecraft and ground-based observatories. They are thought to originate from the ion foreshock, extending upstream of the Earth’s quasi-parallel bow shock (the angle between IMF and shock normal \\(\\theta_{Bn}\\le 45^\\circ\\)). There, ULF waves in the Pc3 frequency range are produced by ion beam instabilities, due to the interaction of shock-reflected suprathermal ions with the incoming solar wind.\nFor the foreshock-related Pc3/4 waves, we have the following picture. After foreshock waves are generated, they propagate through the magnetosheath (with very few observations) and reach the magnetopause. They enter the dayside magnetopause and travel antisunward into the magnetosphere as compressional Pc3 fluctuations, transporting the wave energy towards the nightside. In the inner magnetosphere, they may couple to Alfvénic field line resonances (FLRs), where their frequency matches the eigenmodes of the Earth’s magnetic field lines. Pc3 FLRs was observed at low latitudes and Pc4 at midlatitudes [Yumoto+, 1985]. The amplitude of the compressional mode decays when moving further into the magnetosphere, yet they can sometimes be observed all the way to the midnight sector. Compressional Pc3 wave power associated with transmitted foreshock waves is confined near the equator. Statistical study also shows that equatorial Pc3 wave power is stronger in the prenoon or noon sector (under various geomagnetic activity levels), consistent with the foreshock extending upstream of the dawn flank bow shock for a Parker-spiral IMF orientation. However, contrary to Pc5 pulsations (150-600 s), Pc3 wave activity does not show a clear correlation with the level of geomagnetic disturbances.\nAlso, note that not all Pc3 waves are related to foreshock waves, thus we may have different survey results about the distribution of Pc3 waves. This hints the fact that we are far from understanding the whole physical mechanism of wave generation.\nThere are several mechanisms by which Pc3-4 ULF waves may propagate to high latitudes:\n\nHarmonics of fundamental mode Pc5 resonances. Such harmonics would be expected to exhibit the same form of amplitude and phase properties that characterize FLRs and should occur at the same time as the fundamental.\nCavity modes (Chapter 16).\nFast mode waves propagate without mode conversion through the magnetosphere directly to the ionosphere. Such waves are subject to refraction and diffraction on their passage through the magnetosphere and may be directed to high latitudes via Fermat’s Principle (???).\nTransistor model that invokes beams of precipitating electrons [Engebretson+ 1991] (???). The transistor model requires no wave mode coupling or wave propagation across field lines, rather the modulated precipitation of electrons in response to pressure fluctuations in the magnetosheath. The latter are attributed to the upstream ion-cyclotron resonance mechanism. The modulated electron beams convey wave information from the outer magnetosphere region containing the parent population of trapped electrons, to the near-cusp ionosphere. The resultant periodic precipitation would modulate the ionospheric conductivity and hence ionospheric currents equatorward of the cusp. Overhead field lines could then be excited by these modulated currents equatorward of the cusp, with the same frequency as the modulated electrons. Engebretson likened this behavior to that of a transistor, where a small base current modulates a larger flow from collector to emitter. These ULF waves are characterized by noise-like appearance and low coherence lengths.\n\n\n\n22.4.3 Pc5\nWe learned from ground, ionospheric, and space observations about the existence of only one or at least a few resonant field line vibrations (i.e. eigenoscillations) in the Pc5 range in the magnetosphere. As the Alfvén velocity is varying in the radial direction and as most sources of magnetospheric hydromagnetic waves are broadband sources, the resonance condition can be matched at an infinite number of geomagnetic field lines. Thus, every field line should be in resonance for a broad enough energy source. Therefore the observational fact of “magic” frequencies requires a magnetospheric frequency selection rule. (Kivelson and Southwood 1985) suggested that perturbations due to a broadband source at, e.g., the magnetopause first couple to the discrete eigenoscillations of global compressional eigenmodes. These narrow band compressional modes then couple to Alfvénic perturbations due to the field line resonance mechanism. The global modes thus select the frequency components participating in the resonant coupling. An alternative way of selection has been proposed by [Fujita+, 1996], who demonstrated that the K-H instability at the surface of a non-uniform magnetospheric plasma introduces dispersive properties of the unstable waves, which then gives rise to a narrower source spectrum. Thus, the field line resonance concept as outlined in Chapter 16 is able to explain the major features of observed resonant ULF pulsations in the terrestrial magnetosphere.\n\n\n22.4.4 Sinks\nAccording to (D. Southwood and Hughes 1983), possible sinks of ULF wave energy include at least three mechanisms:\n\ndamping through ionospheric Joule heating,\ngeneralized Landau damping, and\nmode coupling.\n\nBy comparing the effects of Landau damping, Joule heating, and waveguide propagation, later researchers found from case studies that Joule heating and magnetospheric waveguide propagation are insufficient to account for the observed decay rate of ULF wave energy; Landau damping of the wave due to drift-bounce resonance with energetic ions was probably stronger, and more efficient when heavy ions such as \\(O^+\\) are present.\n\n\n22.4.5 Interaction with Energetic Particles\n\n22.4.5.1 Resonance\nA widely used theory of energetic particle modulation by ULF transverse waves was developed by (D. J. Southwood and Kivelson 1981, 1981). In their theory, particles experience the wave-carried electric field during their drift-bounce motion and their energy is accordingly changed. The drift-bounce resonance of energetic particles is determined from \\[\n\\Omega - m\\omega_d = N\\omega_b\n\\tag{22.7}\\] where \\(N\\) is an integer (normally \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\) or \\(0\\)), \\(m\\) represents the azimuthal mode number of the ULF wave, and \\(\\Omega,\\omega_d\\) and \\(\\omega_b\\) are the wave frequency and particle drift and bouce frequencies, respectively. \\(N=0\\) is known as the drift resonance whereas \\(N\\neq 1\\) is the drift-bounce resonance. Because of the known energy dependence of \\(\\omega_d\\) and \\(\\omega_b\\), the resonance energy can be calculated if the wave properties (\\(\\Omega\\) and \\(m\\)) are known. Observations from MMS and Cluster can be found in the review paper by Zong, Rankin, and Zhou (2017).\nFor particles of charge \\(q\\) experiencing drift motion in a ULF wave, the kinetic energy \\(W\\) changes at the following rate: \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}W_\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q \\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{d}\n\\tag{22.8}\\] where subscript \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) signifies an average over many gyration periods, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the wave associated electric field, and \\(\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{d}\\) is the magnetic gradient and curvature drift velocity. For an equatorially mirroring particle (vanishing curvature drift) in Earth’s magnetic dipole field, the drift velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{d}\\) can be approximated in the nonrelativistic limit by \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{d} = -\\frac{3L^2 W}{q B_\\mathrm{E}R_\\mathrm{E}}\\hat{e}_\\phi\n\\tag{22.9}\\] where \\(\\hat{e}_\\phi\\) is defined eastward, \\(R_\\mathrm{E}\\) is Earth’s radius, \\(L\\) is the L-shell parameter (radial distance in \\(R_\\mathrm{E}\\) of the equatorial crossing point a field line), and \\(B_\\mathrm{E}\\) is the equatorial magnetic field on Earth’s surface. ULF waves propagate in the azimuthal direction with the wave-associated electric field given by \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = E_\\phi \\exp\\,i(m\\phi-\\omega t)\\hat{e}_\\phi\n\\tag{22.10}\\] where \\(\\phi\\) is the magnetic longitude (increasing eastward), \\(m\\) is the azimuthal wave number, and \\(\\omega\\) is the wave angular frequency. From (Equation 22.8, Equation 22.9, Equation 22.10) the average rate of change of the particle energy is thus given by the following equation: \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}W_\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{3L^2 W}{B_\\mathrm{E}R_\\mathrm{E}}\\cdot E_\\phi \\exp\\,i(m\\phi-\\omega t)\n\\tag{22.11}\\] which should be integrated along the particle drift orbit to \\(t=-\\infty\\) to achieve an energy gain \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) from waves. Here, the particle’s drift orbit is assumed to be unperturbed (despite the energy change of the particle from the waves) with the angular drift frequency \\(\\omega_\\mathrm{d}\\) given by \\[\n\\omega_\\mathrm{d} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{3L^2 W}{B_\\mathrm{E}R_\\mathrm{E}^2}\n\\tag{22.12}\\]\nAn integration of Equation 22.11 backward in time along the particle’s drift orbit Equation 22.12 leaves a result that depends on the initial condition assuming the amplitude of the sinusoidal waves remains constant. To circumvent this problem, Southwood and Kivelson (1981) assumed the wave angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) is complex with a small, positive imaginary part \\(\\Im(\\omega)\\) that represents a gradually growing wave signal. This assumption enables the particle to see a sinusoid for a finite interaction time, which on integration of Equation 22.11 yields an averaged particle energy gain (???) \\[\n\\delta W_\\mathrm{A} = -i\\cdot\\frac{3L^2 W}{B_\\mathrm{E}R_\\mathrm{E}}\\frac{E_\\phi\\exp\\,i(m\\phi-\\omega t)}{\\omega-m\\omega_\\mathrm{d}}\n\\tag{22.13}\\]\nDrift resonance happens when the particle drifts at the same azimuthal speed as the wave phase velocity, which indicates that \\(m\\omega_\\mathrm{d} = \\Re(\\omega)\\) so that the denominator of Equation 22.13 becomes \\(\\Im(\\omega)\\times i\\). This small imaginary term suggests that for resonant particles, \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) must oscillate at a large amplitude in antiphase with the wave electric field. For particles with lower or higher energies (smaller or larger \\(\\omega_\\mathrm{d}\\)) the denominator is dominated by its real part and the corresponding \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) oscillations have much smaller amplitudes and are \\(\\pm 90^\\circ\\) out-of-phase with the wave electric field. In other words the amplitude \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) of energy gain must shift in phase by \\(180^\\circ\\) as the resonance is crossed from low energy to high energy.\nAn actual particle detector cannot measure \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) directly, thus Southwood and Kivelson (1981) discussed the associated variations of particle fluxes and phase space densities (PSDs) that theoretical results can be compared directly with observational data. By assuming a negligible gradient of pre-existing particle PSDs in the azimuthal direction, the wave-produced PSD variations, \\(\\delta f_\\mathrm{A}\\), can be written as \\[\n\\delta f_\\mathrm{A} = \\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\left[ \\frac{L}{3W}\\frac{\\partial f(W,L)}{\\partial L} - \\frac{\\partial f(W,L)}{\\partial W} \\right]\n\\] which shows that \\(\\delta f_\\mathrm{A}\\) is proportional to \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) provided there is a pre-existing finite PSD gradient in energy and/or space. Here, the importance of spatial gradients in producing PSD oscillations is emphasized, which is caused by back-and-forth convection of particles as a response to the wave electric field. The PSD variations can be alternatively written as \\[\n\\delta f_\\mathrm{A} = -\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\frac{\\partial f(W,\\mu)}{\\partial W} = \\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\frac{L}{3W}\\frac{\\partial f(L,\\mu)}{\\partial L}\n\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is assumed to be constant for adiabatic behavior of particles interacting with ULF waves. The linear dependence of \\(\\delta f_\\mathrm{A}\\) on \\(\\delta W_\\mathrm{A}\\) suggests that the phase shift of particle PSDs across theresonant energy should also be \\(180^\\circ\\). Such a phase shift is thus treated as a characteristic signature of ULF wave-particle drift resonance.\n\n\n22.4.5.2 Particle trapping by compressional waves\nThe mirror force produced by the magnetic field-aligned component of compressional mode ULF waves can also modulate energetic particle fluxes. Observational evidence from Van Allen Probes can be found in the citations of Zong, Rankin, and Zhou (2017).\n\n\n22.4.5.3 Fast acceleration of charged particles by ULF waves\nThe theory of drift-bounce resonance developed by Southwood and Kivelson (1981, 1981) is valid for axisymmetric magnetic fields. In this case, particles experience the wave electric field along their drift and bounce motion and suffer net energy gain or loss when the resonance condition Equation 22.7 is satisfied, usually for \\(N=0,\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\). Parallel electric fields are neglected as they are usually small in collisionless plasma6. The rate of energy change of a charged particle interacting with a ULF wave is expressed by \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mu\\frac{\\partial B_\\parallel}{\\partial t} + q\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{d}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{E}, \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{d}\\) and \\(\\mu\\) denote the wave electric field, particle drift velocity, and magnetic moment, respectively. The first and second terms on the right-hand-side of the equation represent acceleration due to the wave magnetic and electric fields, respectively.\nIn an asymmetric compressed dipole field, a particle can resonant with low-m global toroidal waves when the wave frequency satisfies \\(\\omega=(m\\pm 1)\\omega_d\\). For example, Elkington, Hudson, and Chan (1999) showed that in a magnetic topology with noon-midnight asymmetry electrons can gain energy from toroidal ULF waves; in other words, toroidal ULF waves can accelerate energetic particles in he radiation belt region under strong solar wind pressure. However, in the inner magnetosphere noon-midnight asymmetry becomes insignificant on low L-shells. Acceleration of energetic electrons by toroidal mode ULF waves may, therefore, be limited to the outer magnetosphere, while in the inner magnetosphere the poloidal mode is more likely responsible. However, in the dayside outer magnetosphere the poloidal electric field of fast mode wave may also accelerate energetic electrons.\n\n\n\n22.4.6 EMIC Wave Events\n(Usanova and Mann 2016)\nEMIC waves are believed to be important for influencing the dynamics of energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere, especially in relation to ring current and radiation belt dynamics. In relation to the ring current, both the dynamical evolution of ion distributions along their drift paths and effects from the solar wind can result in EMIC wave generation from unstable ion distributions. EMIC waves often grow as a result of perpendicular temperature anisotropy, with the ion dynamics and energy and pitch angle distributions in the ring current being modified significantly by the growth of the EMIC instability. EMIC waves are also hypothesized to influence higher energy electrons in the Van Allen belts, through a Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonance, including stimulating potential scattering loss into the atmosphere.\nThe prevalence of dayside EMIC activity during intervals of enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure can be explained by three possible mechanisms, which can lead to the generation of anisotropic proton distributions.\n\n22.4.6.1 Bursty EMIC wave events\nShort-term magnetospheric compressions can increase the \\(A=T_\\perp/T_\\parallel\\) ratio through adiabatic heating and can generate EMIC wave bursts during periods within which the magnetic field strength is increasing (i.e. \\(dB/dt&gt;0\\)). In a dipole field, the resulting anisotropy is generated if the magnetic field magnitude changes from the initial value \\(B_0\\) to the final value \\(B\\), \\[\nA = \\left(\\frac{B}{B_0}\\right)^{1/3}(A_0 + 1) - 1\n\\] where \\(A_0\\) is the initial anisotropy (Olson and Lee 1983). I did not read carefully about the original paper, but I feel like this is related to Equation 14.22 and betatron acceleration.\n\n\n22.4.6.2 Continuous EMIC waves events\nContinuous EMIC waves events may be seen to last for several hours in ground-based magnetometer data, often occurring during intervals while the magnetosphere remains compressed in response to a continuous period of enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure. There are two proposed physical mechanisms which may result in the generation of this type of long-lasting and continuous EMIC wave event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.13: Schematic illustrating mechanisms for continuous EMIC wave event: (a) drift shell splitting and (b) Shabansky orbit [adapted from Usanova 2010b]. (a) Drift path of \\(30^\\circ\\) (orange) and \\(90^\\circ\\) (red) pitch angle protons from the nightside to the dayside magnetosphere; a schematic of the descreasing logarithm of proton flux (green) as a function of radial distance from the Earth is also shown. (b) Trajectory of a proton whose bounce trajectory changes from trapping between mirror points spanning the equatorial plane to trapping between two off-equatorial minimum B regions, resulting in trajectories which do not cross the equatorial plane in the dayside magnetosphere (also known as Shabansky orbits).\n\n\n\n\nDrift-Shell Splitting\n\nParticles with different pitch-angles follow different drift paths, such that particles from different spatial locations can be brought together to create an unstable distribution. While in a symmetric dipolar magnetic field all particles drift around the Earth at the same (initial) equatorial distance, in a compressed magnetic field particles with near \\(90^\\circ\\) pitch angles follow lines of constant magnetic field (conserving magnetic moment), and particles with smaller pitch-angles move along more circular orbits. This is known as drift-shell splitting, which is illustrated by the schematic in Figure 22.13 a.\nFigure 22.13 a shows example drift paths of particles with pitch angles of \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(90^\\circ\\) as they drift from the nightside to the dayside in the magnetosphere. The drift paths of these two particles intersect at the dayside subsolar magnetosphere, while the initial starting point of their trajectories was located in the nightside magnetosphere in two different locations: for a \\(30^\\circ\\) pitch angle particle further away from the Earth and for a \\(90^\\circ\\) pitch angle particle closer to the Earth. In a situation where the flux of particles decreases with radial distance from the Earth as shown in Figure 22.13 a the \\(90^\\circ\\) pitch-angle particles drift closer to the Earth, as compared to smaller pitch-angle particles, will have a larger flux. This leads to an enhancement of the perpendicular temperature with respect to the parallel temperature and makes the distribution temperature anisotropic (with \\(T_\\perp &gt; T_\\parallel\\)), and thereby potentially unstable to EMIC waves. The drift trajectory splitting is more prominent for particles at higher L-shells and for higher degrees of compression. Therefore, for the inner magnetosphere this effect may be important only during intervals of highly increased solar wind dynamic pressure.\n\nShabansky Orbit\n\nThe outer L-shells of the compressed dayside magnetosphere can have two off-equatorial minima in magnetic field strength, which are more pronounced during strong compressions, and can be regarded as a compression-related feature of the reconfigured dayside magnetospheric magnetic field. In such a field topology, particles with \\(90^\\circ\\) pitch angles continue to drift through the equator, but particles with lower pitch angles can mirror at high latitudes without passing through the equator, executing so-called “Shabansky” orbits [Shabansky, 1971]. As particles reach the \\(\\partial B/\\partial s &lt; 0\\) region near the dayside magnetopause, where \\(S\\) is distance along the magnetic field, they escape off-equator and execute repeated bounces and are trapped at mid-latitudes. This is demonstrated in Figure 22.13 b which shows the full trajectory of a proton drifting from the nightside to the dayside magnetosphere. These so-called Shabansky regions can lead to the formation of enhanced temperature anisotropy in two different locations: in the equatorial plane, where there is the absence of the lower pitch angle particles; and second, in the trapped off-equatorial regions where particles’ pitch angle undergoes a net shift towards a higher pitch angle. (???) As a result, the ion perpendicular temperature increases relative to the parallel temperature, with the resulting temperature anisotropy potentially giving rise to the growth of EMIC waves, especially in the off- equatorial regions. Similar to drift shell splitting, when magnetosphere is strongly compressed by the solar wind the regions supporting Shabansky orbits may move further inward, reaching locations inside geosynchronous orbit, to become an important source of dayside temperature anisotropy in the inner magnetosphere.",

    "text": "22.5 Bow Shock\nBow shock is the shock (Chapter 21) resulted from the interaction of supersonic, super-Alfvénic solar wind with the magnetosphere of an astrophysical object.\n\n22.5.1 Foreshock\nThe word “foreshock” is borrowed from geophysics for an earthquake that occurs before a larger seismic event (the “mainshock”) and is related to it in both time and space. In space physics, foreshock is the region upstream from the bow shock that is magnetically connected to the bow shock and contains both solar wind plasma and also charged particles backstreaming from the bow shock. It is typically associated with quasi-parallel shocks, as it is much easier for charged particles to move freely along the normal direction of the shock if it is aligned with \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). If their speed relative to the ambient plasma is fast enough, plasma shocks without Coulomb collisions cannot dissipate all the incoming plasmas; some of them have to “return”. The counter-streaming between the foreshock plasma and the incoming plasma is very unstable and thus excites many types of waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.14: Foreshock configuration showing incident solar wind magnetic field (blue lines), impinging on the bow shock (green curved line), producing backstreaming ions (yellow dots), leaked magnetosheath ions (red dots), and upstream waves (wavy blue lines). The ion foreshock boundary is shown as the red line (Wilson III 2016). The foreshock boundary is the reflected ion trajectory tangent to the shock surface, taking into account the combination of a field-aligned motion and the solar wind convection electric field.\n\n\n\nFigure 22.14 demonstrate the basic geometry of Earth’s foreshock. The slanted straight lines are the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind that is flowing downward in the figure and encounters the curved bow shock (green curve). The angle between the magnetic field and the normal direction at the shock is denoted as \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn}\\). The portion of the bow shock where \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn} &gt; 45^\\circ\\) (i.e., the region to the left of the Earth in the figure) is termed the “quasi-perpendicular shock”, while the region to the right, \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn} &lt; 45^\\circ\\), is the “quasi-parallel shock” that extends all the way down to \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn} \\sim 0^\\circ\\) - the “parallel shock”. At the shock near \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn} \\sim 90^\\circ\\), some of the incoming solar wind electrons, which have small gyroradii, are reflected and propagate back upstream creating the region known as the “electron foreshock”. Some of the solar wind ions impinging on the bow shock near \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn} \\sim 90^\\circ\\) are also reflected, but because they have larger gyroradii, quickly gyrate into the downstream. At somewhat smaller \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn}\\), but still associated with the quasi-perpendicular bow shock, a fraction of the solar wind ions are also reflected and travel back upstream along the magnetic field as well as being convected in the solar wind (\\(\\mathbf{V}_{E\\times B}\\) in the figure) to form the quasi-perpendicular portion of the ion foreshock. Farther to the right of the ion foreshock boundary shown in Figure 22.14, ions originating at the shock at even smaller \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn}\\), e.g., on the quasi-parallel portion of the shock, also propagate upstream (dots in the figure), generating larger amplitude waves in the magnetic field (blue wavy lines), to form the quasi-parallel portion of the ion foreshock. These backstreaming ions may have been from the solar wind and reflected at the shock or could have leaked out of the magnetosheath. This process extends deep in the foreshock to \\(\\theta_\\mathrm{Bn} \\sim 0^\\circ\\), where the shock normal is essentially parallel to the solar wind magnetic field.\nThe dominant wave mode in the ion foreshock is produced by the ion-ion beam right-hand instability and has a typical period around 30 s in Earth’s foreshock. Their exact period however varies significantly depending on the solar wind conditions, in particular the IMF strength, between 10 and 80 s. One easy way to think about this is by remembering the gyrofrequency \\(\\omega_c=qB/m\\): the beam instabilities are associated with the cyclotron resonance, and the gyrofrequency is directly related to \\(B\\). Their wavelength is of the order of \\(1\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\) and they are left-hand polarized in the spacecraft frame. Their intrinsic polarization is however right-handed, indicative of a fast mode. The polarization reversal is due to the waves attempting to propagate sunward, while they are effectively carried earthward by the faster solar wind flow. The fast mode is also consistent with the observed positively correlated magnetic field strength and plasma density fluctuations.\nThe ion-ion right-hand resonant instability is driven by ion beams that are cold and fast, streaming back from the bow shock along the magnetic field, characteristically produced in the quasi-perpendicular portion of the foreshock. During the initial growth of the instability, the excited electromagnetic waves have group velocities close to the beam speed, so that the field energy propagates with the beam. The waves pitch-angle scatter the beam reducing the free energy.\nElectromagnetic ion beam instabilities with somewhat different properties are also found deeper in the foreshock on magnetic field lines that connect to the nearly parallel portion of the bow shock. Here the ion beams are slower and hotter and instead of being generated by reflection at the shock, are more likely to result from heating and scattering of the cold beam ions, processes related to the unsteady nature of the parallel shock, or from magnetosheath ions that leaked out into the foreshock. Other types of ion beam instabilities arise elsewhere in space, e.g., in the plasma sheet boundary layer upstream of slow-mode shocks in the magnetotail and in the vicinity of comets.\nFrom spacecraft missions ISEE, Cluster and MMS, we have found two main populations of backstreaming ions, termed reflected and diffuse. The reflected ions have a sharply peaked energy spectrum and relatively collimated flow coming from the bow shock along the interplanetary magnetic field with number densities \\(\\sim 1.5\\%\\) of the solar wind. In contrast, the diffuse ions have a much flatter energy spectrum and broad angular distributions, with lower density \\(\\sim 0.7\\%\\) of the solar wind. These two populations occur in separate regions of the foreshock, with reflected ions in the quasi-perpendicular portion and the diffuse ions in the more nearly parallel portion of the foreshock, suggesting different mechanisms of origin and acceleration. In between the reflected and diffuse ion populations, were intermediate ions that had a crescent shape in velocity space, which corresponds to the gyro-phase bunched ions and pitch-angle scattering by the generated waves. The reflected ions were so named, because backstreaming beams of ions were observed traveling upstream in a direction determined by the interplanetary magnetic field and the convection velocity (\\(\\mathbf{V}_{E\\times B}\\)), consistent with simple models of specular reflection at the bow shock.\nObservations from ISEE also showed that there were usually weak waves occurring with reflected beam ions, while with diffuse ions large amplitude, compressive waves often occurred. Obliquely propagating waves were also observed, often in the form of steepened waves, termed shocklets. In addition, deeper in the foreshock Alfven waves were also generated in associated with the diffuse ions. The location in the foreshock where the low frequency waves begin to appear, is called ULF foreshock boundary, near the ion foreshock boundary. Another wave produced deep in the foreshock near the quasi-parallel bow shock is termed short large-amplitude magnetic structures (SLAMS).\nThe linear theory of beam instabilities in magnetized plasmas is developed by Peter Gary. He numerically solved the complete dispersion relation for both electrostatic and electromagnetic waves excited by various sorts of free energy: i.e., beams of electrons or ions, temperature anisotropies in either the background or beam species, etc.7 In (Gary, Gosling, and Forslund 1981), he showed how a weak (~1% density) beam initially produces a low level of waves with growth times &gt; 25 s. Because the growth rate of the waves is small, the ion beam propagates a long distance upstream from the bow shock before the waves grow to large amplitude. But in the process of propagating upstream, the beam ions and the waves are convected deep into the quasi-parallel portion of the foreshock, where they are slowed. The beam ions loses parallel momentum as they are pitch-angle scattered by the waves, producing intermediate velocity distributions (kidney shaped). This loss of energy and momentum by the beam, and the waves, causes the solar wind to be deflected and slowed, as observed by Bame et al. (1980). Since the compressibility (i.e., the density fluctuations computed from linear theory) of oblique waves8 is significantly larger than for parallel propagation, oblique waves can grow and produce density fluctuations in agreement with observations.\nIn Gary et al. (1984), four linear electromagnetic ion instabilities are compared (Section 21.6.1). Numerical solutions of the linear dispersion relation are presented to show that for parallel propagation the righthand resonant instability has a lower instability threshold than the non-resonant instability unless the beam speed or beam density is sufficiently large. For hot ion beams a left-hand resonant instability is also excited, and if there is a large temperature anisotropy in the beam (\\(T_{b,\\perp} \\gg T_{b,\\parallel}\\)), a left-hand ion cyclotron instability is also possible. Therefore, the deterministic factors for the driven instabilities would be\n\nbeam density \\(n_b\\)\nbeam velocity \\(V_b\\) (w.r.t. \\(V_A\\))\nbeam temperature \\(T_b\\)\nbeam pressure anisotropy\n\nIn Gary, Thomsen, and Fuselier (1986), linear theory of both the right-hand resonant and non-resonant instabilities driven by an energetic, cool ion beam is used to calculate the phase angle between the fluctuating velocity of the beam ions relative to the fluctuating magnetic field in order to determine whether gyrophase bunching of the beam ions is observable. Distinct gyrophase-bunched ions have been observed in the foreshock by ISEE. Peter’s linear calculations showed that for the non-resonant mode, the phase angle is \\(\\sim 0^\\circ\\), while for the resonant mode it is \\(\\sim 90^\\circ\\) for the most unstable wavenumber. Both observations and simulations support the right-hand resonant instability for generating the observable gyrophase bunching for the ion beam.\nDespite all these achievements, a major problem remains — the observed ULF waves are primarily propagating oblique to the magnetic field, contrary to linear theory that says the parallel mode has the largest growth rate and thus in time will become the dominant mode. Measurements by Cluster (Eastwood et al. (2005)) indicate a mean angle of \\(21^\\circ\\). An even more interesting suggestion is given later by Strumik et al. (2015). In their foreshock simulations they assume that the solar wind is essentially radial. They find that while parallel unstable modes dominate, oblique waves are also generated, and when properly averaged over phase space density, the “average” propagation direction is \\(\\sim 20^\\circ\\), consistent with Eastwood et al. (2005).9\n\n\n22.5.2 Transmission of Waves\nAn interesting question arises about the transmission of fast waves through the bow shock into the downstream. A list of possible mechanisms are summarized in Figure 22.15. (Turc et al. 2022) argued that the earthward magnetosonic disturbances can then propagate to and disturb the magnetopause, whereas shock reformation and mode conversion play only minor roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.15: Foreshock waves (purple wavy lines) are generated in the region upstream from the bow shock (left black curve) where the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines (dashed lines) are quasi-parallel to the shock normal \\(\\hat{n}\\) (shaded blue). Foreshock waves are convected towards the bow shock by the solar wind (red arrow) and transmit through the magnetosheath via mechanisms indicated in the white boxes along the bow shock: mode conversion, shock reformation, and modulation of shock compression. The transmitted waves propagate away from or towards Earth relative to the magnetosheath plasma (indicated by the wave vector \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)).\n\n\n\nAs usual in plasma physics, accompanying the ion foreshock we have electron foreshock at a much smaller scale.\nThe formation of ion/electron foreshocks requires counter-streaming of ions and electrons, respectively. Since there is only one velocity for each species in the electron/ion two-fluid equations, it is not possible to trigger this instability in a multi-moment model. Theoretically we may have an extremely simplified case where the ion counter-streaming is represented by two ion fluids, but there are very few studies on this topic. The minimum requirement may be gyrokinetics.",

    "text": "22.7 Magnetosphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.16: The magnetosphere with its current system.\n\n\n\n\n22.7.1 Magnetopause\nThe magnetopause is the abrupt boundary between a magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma. The collision frequency of particles in the plasma in the interplanetary medium is very low and the electrical conductivity is so high that it could be approximated to an infinite conductor. A magnetic field in a vacuum cannot penetrate a volume with infinite conductivity. Chapman and Bartels (1940) illustrated this concept by postulating a plate with infinite conductivity placed on the dayside of a planet’s dipole as shown in Figure 22.17. The field lines on the dayside are bent. At low latitudes, the magnetic field lines are pushed inward. At high latitudes, the magnetic field lines are pushed backwards and over the polar regions. The boundary between the region dominated by the planet’s magnetic field (i.e., the magnetosphere) and the plasma in the interplanetary medium is the magnetopause. Since the solar wind is continuously flowing outward, the magnetopause above, below and to the sides of the planet are swept backward into the geomagnetic tail as shown in the artist’s concept. The region (shown in pink in the schematic) which separates field lines from the planet which are pushed inward from those which are pushed backward over the poles is an area of weak magnetic field or day-side cusp. Solar wind particles can enter the planet’s magnetosphere through the cusp region. Because the solar wind exists at all times and not just times of solar flares, the magnetopause is a permanent feature of the space near any planet with a magnetic field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.17: Schematic representation of a planetary dipole magnetic field in a vacuum (right side) deformed by a region of plasma with infinite conductivity. The Sun is to the left. The configuration is equivalent to an image dipole (green arrow) being placed at twice the distance from the planetary dipole to the interaction boundary.\n\n\n\nIf one assumed that magnetopause was just a boundary between a magnetic field in a vacuum and a plasma with a weak magnetic field embedded in it, then the magnetopause would be defined by electrons and ions penetrating one gyroradius into the magnetic field domain. Since the gyro-motion of electrons and ions is in opposite directions, an electric current flows along the boundary.\n\n22.7.1.1 Estimation of the standoff distance\nThe location of the magnetopause is determined by the pressure balance between the internal magnetic field and external solar wind. As a first order estimation of the standoff distance to the magnetopause, we neglect the internal magnetospheric thermal pressure and let the dynamic ram pressure from the solar wind being equal to the magnetic pressure from the Earth’s magnetic field:10 \\[\n\\left( \\rho v^2 \\right)_\\textrm{sw} \\approx \\left( \\frac{4B(r)^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right)_\\textrm{m}\n\\] where \\(\\rho\\) and \\(v\\) are the density and velocity of the solar wind, and \\(B(r)\\) is the magnetic field strength of the planet in SI units.\nSince the dipole magnetic field strength varies with distance as \\(1/r^3\\) the magnetic field strength can be written as \\(B(r)=B_0/r^3\\), where \\(B_0\\) is the planet’s magnetic moment, expressed in \\([\\textrm{T}\\cdot \\textrm{m}^3]\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho v^2 \\approx \\frac{2B_0^2}{r^6 \\mu_0} \\\\\nr \\approx \\left( \\frac{2B_0^2}{\\mu_0 \\rho v^2} \\right)^{1/6}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe distance from Earth to the subsolar magnetopause varies over time due to solar activity, but typical distances range from \\(6-15 R_{\\oplus}\\). Empirical models (e.g. (Shue et al. 1997)) using real-time solar wind data can provide a real-time estimate of the magnetopause location.\nTable 22.2 summarizes the basic sizes of each planet in the solar system. Venus and Mars do not have a planetary magnetic field and do not have a magnetopause. The solar wind interacts with the planet’s atmosphere and a void is created behind the planet. In the case of the Earth’s moon and other bodies without a magnetic field or atmosphere, the body’s surface interacts with the solar wind and a void is created behind the body, often called wake. All planets may show the effect of inductance, depending on the conductivity of the ionosphere or ionosphere-like sphere. The interaction of IMF with a conductor induces current on the surface of the conductor and create an induced magnetic field which opposes the external field from penetrating into the conductor. This is a major contribution at Mars, a minor contribution at Mercury and Ganymede, and somehow being negligible at other large planets.\n\n\n\nTable 22.2: Solar system magnetopauses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanet\nMagnetic Moment11\nStandoff Distance12\nVariance13\n\n\n\n\nMercury\n0.0004\n1.5\n0\n\n\nVenus\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nEarth\n1\n10\n2\n\n\nMars\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nJupiter\n20000\n42\n25\n\n\nSaturn\n600\n19\n3\n\n\nUranus\n50\n25\n0\n\n\nNeptune\n25\n24\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.7.2 Transport of mass, momentum, and energy\nTransport of mass, momentum, and energy at the magnetopause boundary drives much of the magnetospheric dynamics and is thus an important topic in magnetospheric physics. The amount of solar wind plasma and energy that enters the magnetosphere is regulated by the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF): during southward IMFs, the major process is considered to be magnetic reconnections (Section 13.8), while during northward IMFs, the processes include cusp reconnection, plasma mixing/reconnection in Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, and wave-particle diffusive processes in large-amplitude ULF waves at the magnetopause boundary (?sec-klr).\nOne of the more common spectral features at the magnetopause boundary is the sharp transition in wave polarization from compressional, e.g., because of foreshock waves of the quasi‐parallel bow shock, to transverse (Alfvén) waves from the magnetosheath to the boundary layers. Mode conversion from compressional to Alfvén modes through the magnetopause can efficiently transport and heat plasma across the boundary. Multipoint measurements have verified that the dispersion of the broadband waves is consistent with the kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) [Chaston+,2007, 2008]. KAWs also provide a natural explanation for the observed dawn‐dusk asymmetry in plasma entry during northward IMF because they result from mode conversion of compressional foreshock waves, which typically bathe the dawn flank for the typical Parker spiral configuration.\nAccording to linear theory, when an MHD fast mode compressional wave propagates across in an inhomogeneous plasma, it is coupled with the shear Alfvén wave at the local Alfvén resonance \\(\\omega=k_\\parallel V_A\\), with \\(\\omega\\) being the wave frequency. This process can be very efficient when the fast wave propagates into a region where there is a sharp increase in the Alfvén velocity such as at the magnetopause boundary where the magnetic field increases and density decreases. Typically, the Alfvén velocity across the magnetopause increases by a factor of 10 such that an entire decade (in frequency) of wave power can be captured and localized in the boundary layer leading to massive particle transport. In the MHD description, the coupling occurs where the frequency matches the continuous spectrum and the wave becomes singular corresponding to a pileup of compressional wave energy.\nSingular behavior occurs at either the Alfvén resonance, \\(\\omega^2=k_\\parallel^2 v_A^2\\), or at the sound resonance, where the compressional wave couples with the Alfvén or sound wave that propagates only along the magnetic field. In higher frequency cases, the Alfvén resonance condition is modified because of the finite ion Larmor radius effects (Equation 16.27), where the Alfvén resonance singularity can be removed by including non‐MHD effects such as electron inertia or ion Larmor radius corrections in Equation 16.26. It can be shown that kinetic effects naturally arises from the two-fluid/kinetic theory, including the coupling to KAWs. For more equations, see Section 16.4.\nAt the resonance point, the fast wave solution is coupled to the KAW solution, and transversely polarized Alfvén waves are expected to be generated and radiate away from the mode conversion location. Because the group velocity of these waves is much smaller than the compressional wave, the amplitude of the transverse fluctuations is typically much larger than the amplitude of the compressional driver, consistent with magnetopause observations.\nAs been discussed in Chapter 16, when the azimuthal wave number \\(m\\), or \\(k_y\\) in the box model is zero, there should be no mode coupling. However, this is not true if the finite-frequency effect is considered (Section 16.4), as first noted by (1979).\n\n\n22.7.3 Dungey Cycle\nDungey (1961) was the first to propose a cycle of magnetospheric convection driven by magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetosphere. Magnetic field connected on the dayside of Earth is transported by the solar wind to the night side where it forms a long tail behind the Earth. This transfer of flux to the nightside forces the magnetosphere to undergo systematic changes in configuration that eventually lead to nightside magnetic reconnection, which returns flux to the dayside along the flanks of the magnetosphere via the different response modes.\n\n\n22.7.4 Vasyliunas Cycle\nThe Jovian equivalent to the Dungey cycle of the Earth’s magnetosphere, where the centrifugal force plays a critical role in affecting the plasma convection.\n\n\n22.7.5 Low-Latitude Boundary Layer\nThe Earth’s low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) is the region where magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas are mixed along the magnetospheric side of the low-latitude magnetopause. It has been suggested that three processes — magnetic reconnection at high-latitudes, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and Kinetic Alfvén waves — primarily contribute to the formation, all of which have been observed by in-situ satellites inside the LLBL. Recent studies further suggested that the couplings of these processes effectively enhance the formation rate.\n\n\n\n\nAngelopoulos, Vassilis, Wo Baumjohann, CF Kennel, F Vo Coroniti, MG Kivelson, R Pellat, RJ Walker, H Lühr, and G Paschmann. 1992. “Bursty Bulk Flows in the Inner Central Plasma Sheet.” Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 97 (A4): 4027–39. https://doi.org/10.1029/91JA02701.\n\n\nArnoldy, Roger L, MJ Engebretson, RE Denton, JL Posch, Marc R Lessard, NC Maynard, DM Ober, et al. 2005. “Pc 1 Waves and Associated Unstable Distributions of Magnetospheric Protons Observed During a Solar Wind Pressure Pulse.” Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 110 (A7). https://doi.org/10.1029/2005JA011041.\n\n\nBaker, Daniel N, TI Pulkkinen, V Angelopoulos, W Baumjohann, and RL McPherron. 1996. “Neutral Line Model of Substorms: Past Results and Present View.” Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 101 (A6): 12975–3010. https://doi.org/10.1029/95JA03753.\n\n\nBame, SJ, JR Asbridge, WC Feldman, JT Gosling, G Paschmann, and N Sckopke. 1980. “Deceleration of the Solar Wind Upstream from the Earth’s Bow Shock and the Origin of Diffuse Upstream Ions.” Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 85 (A6): 2981–90. https://doi.org/10.1029/ja085ia06p02981.\n\n\nEastwood, JP, A Balogh, EA Lucek, C Mazelle, and I Dandouras. 2005. “Quasi-Monochromatic ULF Foreshock Waves as Observed by the Four-Spacecraft Cluster Mission: 2.

    "text": "23.1 Current Systems\nElectric fields associated with the viscous interaction and reconnection-driven plasma flow are transmitted along field lines to the ionosphere where they drive currents through the ionosphere. The high latitude FAC are known as region-1 currents, while the lower latitude currents are called region-2 currents. The ionospheric current connecting these two FAC systems flows parallel to the projected electric field and is called the Pedersen current. Since the Pedersen current flows through a resistive ionosphere in the direction of the electric field it causes Ohmic heating \\(\\mathbf{j}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}&gt;0\\). The two shells of FAC form a solenoid so that the magnetic perturbations they create are confined to the region between them and cannot be detected on the ground. Because of the interaction of the motion of ionized gases with the neutral atmosphere, the ions and electrons undergo different drift motion. Ions, due to higher collision rates with the neutral atmosphere, have a component of motion perpendicular to the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift direction, while the electrons generally follow \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\). The non-dissipative (\\(\\mathbf{j}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=0\\)) Hall current flows at right angles to both the electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic effects of the Hall current driven by the region-1 and 2 currents can be observed on the ground and are known as the DP-2 current system.1\nIn the context of ionospheric energy dissipation, the different current systems can be classified into two types based on how energy is processed.\nBoth processes cause precipitation of charged particles that also deposit energy in the atmosphere.\nThe characteristic feature of the driven DP-2 current system is the existence of the eastward and westward electrojets flowing toward midnight along the auroral oval. Rough measures of the strength of these currents are the auroral upper (AU) and auroral lower (AL) indices. These are respectively the largest positive northward magnetic perturbation (H) measured on the ground under the eastward electrojet by any magnetic observatory in the afternoon to dusk sector, and the largest negative southward perturbation measured in the late evening to morning sector. Both AU and AL begin to grow in intensity soon after the IMF turns southward and dayside reconnection begins. The characteristic feature of the unloading DP-1 current system is the sudden development of an additional westward current that flows across the bright region of the expanding auroral bulge. This is the ionospheric segment of the substorm current wedge. The onset of this current is recorded in the AL index as a sudden decrease, corresponding to an increase in intensity of the westward current.",

    "section": "23.2 M-I Coupling",
    "text": "23.2 M-I Coupling\nIonospheric properties, principally conductivity, provide boundary conditions for magnetospheric convection, and the ionosphere is often treated as a passive part of the system. Especially during substorms, however, the boundary conditions change in a time-dependent and spatially localized fashion, allowing ionospheric feedback that can alter the magnetospheric dynamics. The coupling from the ionospheric perspective differs primarily in that the ionospheric conductance is anisotropic due to the influence of the neutral atmosphere, involving Hall as well as Pedersen conductivity. These conductivities are altered both by the connecting currents and the precipitating electrons associated with upward field-aligned currents, which increase Pedersen conductivity and field line tying. An important role is also played by field-aligned electric fields, set up locally, primarily in upward field-aligned current regions, which are the cause of auroral intensifications and, specifically auroral arcs.\nFor magnetosphere simulations, the simplest inner boundary is treated as a conducting sphere (\\(\\mathbf{B}_\\text{normal}=0\\), \\(\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{v}=0\\)). However, this is often not realistic enough to reveal the nature. In magnetosphere simulations, the location of tail main reconnection site will be closer to the Earth by simply applying a conducting boundary. The next level extension is to employ a magnetospheric-ionospheric electrostatic coupling model. This means that we seek nonzero \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) at the inner boundary. The inner boundary, where the MHD quantities are connected to the ionosphere, is taken to be a shell of radius \\(r_\\text{in}\\) (e.g. \\(r_\\text{in}\\sim 3\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\)). The ionosphere locates at \\(r_\\text{ion}\\sim 1000\\,\\text{km}\\sim 0.15\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\). Ideally \\(r_\\text{in}\\) shall be as close to \\(r_\\text{ion}\\) as possible, but typically it is restricted by computational limitations, such as extraneously high Alfvén speeds and very large \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) field gradients closer to the Earth. Inside this shell we do not solve the governing equations (MHD/PIC/Vlasov), but assume a static dipole field. The important physical processes within the shell are the flow of field-aligned currents (FACs) and the closure of these currents in the ionosphere. At each time step,\n\nThe magnetospheric FACs are mapped along the field lines from the inner boundary to the ionosphere assuming \\(j_\\parallel/B=\\text{const.}\\), which are the input to the ionospheric potential equation (Raeder, Walker, and Ashour-Abdalla 1995) \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\pmb{\\Sigma}\\cdot\\nabla\\Phi) = -j_\\parallel\\sin I\n\\tag{23.1}\\] where \\(\\pmb{\\Sigma}\\) is the conductance tensor, \\(\\Phi\\) is the electric potential, \\(j_\\parallel\\) is the mapped FAC density with the downward considered positive and corrected for flux tube convergence, and \\(I\\) is the inclination of the dipole field at the ionosphere, \\(\\sin I=\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-I)=\\hat{b}\\cdot\\hat{r}\\). The derivation from the charge conservation can be found in Section 9.8.7. There is another form derived by [Wolf 1983]: \\[\n\\nabla_\\perp\\cdot\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_P/\\cos^2\\delta & -\\sigma_H\\cos\\delta \\\\ \\sigma_H/\\cos\\delta & \\sigma_P \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot\\nabla_\\perp\\Phi =\nj_\\parallel\\cos\\delta\n\\tag{23.2}\\] where \\(\\delta\\) is the magnetic field dip angle: \\[\n\\cos\\delta = -2\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sqrt{1+3\\cos^2\\theta}}\n\\] for the northern hemisphere, where \\(\\theta\\) is the polar angle (magnetic colatitude). I DON’T KNOW THE RELATION BETWEEN THESE TWO!\nEquation 23.1 is solved on the surface of a sphere \\(r=r_\\text{ion}\\). Commonly there are two types of boundary conditions: (1) \\(\\Phi=0\\) at the equator (Raeder, Walker, and Ashour-Abdalla 1995), or (2) constant potential at or near the low‐latitude boundary (e.g. LFM, BATSRUS). From here, one can either choose a static analytic model of Hall and Pederson conductance that accounts for multiple physics, or simply adopt a uniform Pederson conductance, or the height-integrated conductivity, \\(\\Sigma_p = 5\\,\\text{Siemens}\\), while the Hall conductance \\(\\Sigma_H\\) is assumed to be zero. The latter one is simplified to solve \\[\n\\nabla^2\\Phi = -j_\\parallel\\sin I/\\Sigma_p\n\\]\n\nA more realistic conductance requires considering EUV and diffuse auroral contributions (???) as well. The solar EUV contribution to \\(\\pmb{\\Sigma}\\) is considered constant in time, but naturally it varies with the solar zenith angle. For example, the empirical formulas by [Moen and Brekke 1993] can be used. The solar EUV radiation is approximated by the 10.7 cm radio flux (commonly known as F10.7), a widely used proxy solar UV activity, whose standard values is taken to be \\(100\\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{W}/\\text{m}^2\\).\nThe total conductance can be then expressed as \\[\n\\Sigma_{P,H} = \\sqrt{(\\Sigma_{P,H}^{e-})^2 + (\\Sigma_{P,H}^{\\text{UV}})^2}\n\\]\nThis is because \\(\\sigma_{P,H}\\propto n_e\\), which in a stationary state is proportional to the square root of the production rate, and it is the production rates that can be summed linearly. (???)\nDoes this look well? Not yet. We know that while the high‐latitude ionospheric convection is driven by the solar wind and magnetosphere interaction, at lower latitudes atmospheric neutral winds start to dominate. The next level approximation needs to take this into account. Because there is a gap between \\(r_\\text{ion}\\) and \\(r_\\text{in}\\), the ionospheric footprint of their grid has a low‐latitude boundary somewhere in the midlatitudes, e.g., 45° when \\(r_\\text{in}\\sim 2\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\) (Figure 23.1). Global magnetospheric models, unless they are fully coupled to models of the inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere, lack details of the ionospheric convection at latitudes equatorward of their low‐latitude ionospheric boundary. To some extent, such details can be translated to the global model via the low‐latitude boundary condition used to solve Equation 23.2. The easy way is to set the ionospheric potential to zero everywhere on the boundary. This corresponds to no flow across the boundary in the ionosphere or the inner boundary of the magnetosphere simulation in the equatorial plane. The choice of this boundary condition is usually justified by the argument that it helps to shield the inner magnetosphere from the cross‐tail electric field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.1: A schematic depiction of the inner boundary of the magnetosphere simulation and its ionospheric mapping. The location of the low‐latitude boundary of the ionospheric grid is determined by the radius of the inner MHD boundary mapped along the dipole field from the equator. Point A (at 45°) denotes a typical location of the low‐latitude boundary, where the STANDARD and NEUMANN boundary conditions are applied, while point B is where the LOWERBC boundary condition is applied. The three inset plots at the bottom depict schematically the configuration of velocity and electric field vectors with respect to the surface of the ionosphere in a meridional plane. The inset plot titles identify the type of the boundary condition and the point where it is applied. Adopted from (Merkin and Lyon 2010).\n\n\n\n(Merkin and Lyon 2010) tested three different boundary conditions for the potential equation:\n\nSTANDARD: Dirichlet, the potential at the low‐latitude boundary is set to zero.\nNEUMANN: the electric field component normal to the low‐latitude boundary was set to zero. This condition requires all ionospheric plasma to move normal to the boundary.\nLOWERBC: Dirichlet, but the location of the low‐latitude boundary was moved to 2° above the equator, thus allowing the plasma to move across the magnetosphere inner boundary. (???) Equation 23.3 is singular at \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\), which is why the calculation has to stop just short of the equator. (???)\n\n\nSparse linear algebra, GMRES together with an imcomplete LU preconditioner (default for many modern solvers) are usually applied to solve the potential equation. This is generally an easy equation to solve mathematically.\nOnce the potential equation is solved the ionospheric potential is mapped back to the \\(r_\\text{in}\\) shell and used as a boundary condition for the magnetospheric flow by taking \\(\\mathbf{v}=(-\\nabla\\Phi)\\times\\mathbf{B}/B^2\\).\n\n\n23.2.1 Caveats\n\nThe mapping assumes conservation, which is not perfect. In practice \\(r_\\text{in}\\sim 4\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\) is a minimum requirement for reasonable FACs.\nMost numerical codes couples a Cartesian grid to a spherical ionosphere grid, while some couples a spherical grid to a spherical grid. For magnetosphere simulations we need a relatively simple but super fast electric potential solver, therefore structured mesh is often adopted. If a spherical grid is used, care must be taken near the pole since it is a singular from the grid but not physics. Equation 23.2 under spherical coordinates is written as\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\Big[ \\sin\\theta\\frac{\\Sigma_P}{\\cos^2\\delta}\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} - \\frac{\\Sigma_H}{\\cos\\delta}\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\phi} \\Big] \\\\\n+ &\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}\\Big[ \\frac{\\Sigma_P}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\phi}+\\frac{\\Sigma_H}{\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta}\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} \\Big] = j_\\parallel R^2\\cos\\delta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{23.3}\\]\n\nBe careful about distinguishing \\(E_\\parallel\\) and \\(j_\\parallel\\). \\(E_\\parallel = 0\\) from advection and Hall terms, but \\(j_\\parallel=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\hat{b}/\\mu_0\\) can be nonzero at the MHD inner boundary.\nHow important it is to use a more realistic conductance model? (Merkin and Lyon 2010) shows that different BCs may give &gt; 10% CPCP values, but I have no clue about the effect of a more complicated conductance.",

Assumptions are made.\nHow to solve each direction (coupled or independently)? For the ionosphere, along the field-line is treated differently than across the field-lines.\nAs the equations of motion are solved for, the source terms must be added. How to treat these with respect to solving in the different directions?\nBuild a simple 1D ionosphere model is easy (CAN I MAKE ONE MYSELF?).\nSteady-state - assume \\(\\partial \\mathbf{X}/\\partial t = 0\\). Strangly, this is applied in situations in which the value can change on a time scale much faster than the time-step. For example, the ion velocity is often assumed to be steady-state. Ion chemistry is sometimes assumed to be steady-state.\n\n23.3.1 Chemistry\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} = S - L\n\\] where \\(N\\) is the number density of the species, \\(S\\) represents the sources and \\(L\\) represents the losses. Losses can almost always be expressed as: \\[\nL = RMN\n\\] where \\(R\\) is the reaction rate, \\(M\\) is the density of the species it is reacting with.\nFor a steady-state, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS - L &= 0 \\\\\nN &= \\frac{S}{RM}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is quite stable, but can be very wrong in regions of slowly changing ion densities, such as in the F-region. This is perfect for the E-region, though. It is quite easy to implement in a simple environment, but can be much more complicated as non-linear terms are include (recombination, in which \\(M\\) can depend on \\(N\\)).\nAn explicit time step chemistry is trivial to implement in almost all situations, but it is also the least stable, since the loss terms can become larger than the source terms and the density can quickly be driven to negative values. Subcycling can help with this, but not always.\nAn implicit time step chemistry is relatively stable and easier to implement than steady-state. For example in GITM, there is a blend between sub-cycling and a simplified implicit scheme that switches depending on the size of the loss term compared to the density.\nNow we need to also look at the source terms. The ionization rates can be obtained from \\(Q_\\text{EUV}\\) and substituting \\(\\sigma_s^i \\lambda\\) instead of \\(\\sigma_s^a\\lambda\\) (not in \\(\\tau\\)). [Schunk and Nagy] Chapter 8 list a bunch of chemical equations.\nAfter that, we write down all the sources and losses, decide a time-stepping scheme, and run the model. However, if we don’t have any ion advection, the F-region will just build and build!\n\n\n23.3.2 Ion Advection\nIn the simplest form, we assume an advection speed and let the densities advect upward and downward.",

Because the ionosphere contains charged particles, it can behave as a conductor. The planet operates as a ground plane, and the resulting cavity behaves as a large waveguide. This is closely related to the concept of skin depth in EM and the cutoff in wave propagation.\nAt Earth, extremely low frequency (ELF) (&lt; 3 kHz) and very low frequency (VLF) (3–30 kHz) signals can propagate efficiently in this waveguide. For instance, lightning strikes launch a signal called radio atmospherics, which can travel many thousands of kilometers, because they are confined between the Earth and the ionosphere. The round-the-world nature of the waveguide produces resonances, like a cavity, which are at \\(\\sim 7\\) Hz.\nA brief introduction can be found on wiki.\n\n\n\n\nMerkin, VG, and JG Lyon. 2010. “Effects of the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Boundary Condition on the Global Magnetosphere.” Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 115 (A10). https://doi.org/10.1029/2010JA015461.\n\n\nRaeder, J, RJ Walker, and M Ashour-Abdalla. 1995. “The Structure of the Distant Geomagnetic Tail During Long Periods of Northward IMF.” Geophysical Research Letters 22 (4): 349–52. https://doi.org/10.1029/94GL03380.",

    "text": "24.2 Modeling\n3D Fokker-Planck diffusion model1 (e.g. (Glauert, Horne, and Meredith 2014)) has been built to model the radiation belt electrons. In the Earth’s radiation belts, the evolution of the phase-averaged phase-space density \\(f(p,r,t)\\) can be described by a diffusion equation (see also Equation 12.19): \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\sum_{i,j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial J_i}\\left[ D_{ij}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial J_j} \\right]\n\\tag{24.1}\\]\nHere \\(D_{ij}\\) are diffusion coefficients and \\(J_i\\) are the action integrals, \\(J_1 = 2\\pi m_e \\mu/|q|\\), \\(J_2 = J\\), and \\(J_3 = q|\\phi|\\), where \\(\\mu,J\\), and \\(\\phi\\) are the adiabatic invariants of charged particle motion, \\(m_e\\) is the electron mass, and \\(q\\) the charge. The adiabatic invariants are awkward variables to visualize and relate to data so many authors transform to other coordinates. One choice is to use pitch angle, energy, and \\(L^\\ast=2\\pi M/(|\\phi| R_\\text{E})\\) (Equation 7.48), where \\(M=8.22\\times 10^{22}\\, \\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^2\\) is the magnetic moment of the Earth’s dipole field and \\(R_\\text{E}\\) is the Earth’s radius, as the three independent variables.\nAssuming a dipole field, changing coordinates to equatorial pitch angle \\(\\alpha\\), kinetic energy \\(E\\), and \\(L^\\ast\\), and neglecting some cross derivatives, Equation 12.19 can be written as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} =& \\frac{1}{g(\\alpha)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha}\\bigg\\rvert_{E,L} g(\\alpha)\\left( D_{\\alpha\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha}\\bigg\\rvert_{E,L} + D_{\\alpha E}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\alpha,L} \\right) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{1}{A(E)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\alpha,L} A(E) \\left( D_{EE}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\alpha,L} + D_{E\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha}\\bigg\\rvert_{E,L} \\right) \\\\\n&+ L^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\mu,J}\\left( \\frac{D_{LL}}{L^2}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\mu,J} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{24.2}\\] where \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(\\alpha) = T(\\alpha)\\sin 2\\alpha \\\\\nA(E) = (E+E_0)(E(E+2E_0))^{1/2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and \\(E_0\\) is the electron rest mass energy. \\(T(\\alpha)\\) is related to the bounce period and in a dipole field can be approximated by \\[\nT(\\alpha) = \\big(1.3802 - 0.3198(\\sin\\alpha + \\sin^{1/2} \\alpha) \\big)\n\\]\n\\(D_{\\alpha\\alpha},\\, D_{\\alpha E}=D_{E\\alpha},\\, D_{EE}\\), and \\(D_{LL}\\) are the drift- and bounce-averaged pitch angle, mixed pitch angle energy, energy and radial diffusion coefficients, respectively. When we need to clarify the fact that they are drift and bounce averaged, they will be explicitly written as \\(\\left&lt; D_{\\alpha\\alpha} \\right&gt;^d, \\left&lt; D_{\\alpha E} \\right&gt;^d, \\left&lt; D_{EE} \\right&gt;^d\\), and \\(\\left&lt; D_{LL} \\right&gt;^d\\), respectively.\nThe bounce-averaged pitch angle and energy diffusion rates are defined by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left&lt; D_{\\alpha\\alpha} \\right&gt; &\\equiv \\left&lt; \\frac{(\\Delta\\alpha)^2}{2\\Delta t} \\right&gt; \\\\\n\\left&lt; D_{\\alpha E} \\right&gt; &\\equiv \\left&lt; \\frac{(\\Delta\\alpha \\Delta E)^2}{2\\Delta t} \\right&gt; \\\\\n\\left&lt; D_{EE} \\right&gt; &\\equiv \\left&lt; \\frac{(\\Delta E)^2}{2\\Delta t} \\right&gt;\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with units of \\(\\text{s}^{-1}, \\text{J}\\text{s}^{-1}\\), and \\(\\text{J}^2\\text{s}^{-1}\\), respectively.\nA loss term of the form \\(f/\\tau_L\\) can be added to represent losses to the atmosphere due to collisions. Here, \\(\\tau_L\\), the loss timescale, is equal to 1/4 of the bounce time in the loss cone and infinite elsewhere. As a first-order approximation, we can neglect the cross terms and simplify Equation 24.2 as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} =& \\frac{1}{g(\\alpha)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha}\\bigg\\rvert_{E,L} g(\\alpha)\\left( D_{\\alpha\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha}\\bigg\\rvert_{E,L}\\right) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{1}{A(E)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\alpha,L} A(E) \\left( D_{EE}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\alpha,L}\\right) \\\\\n&+ L^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\mu,J}\\left( \\frac{D_{LL}}{L^2}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\mu,J} \\right) \\\\\n&- \\frac{f}{\\tau_L}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{24.3}\\]\nThe first three terms on the right-hand side represent pitch angle, energy, and radial diffusion, respectively. The final term accounts for losses to the atmosphere. Pitch angle diffusion has contributions from wave-particle interactions and Coulomb collisions with the atmosphere, though the latter are only significant inside the loss cone. Energy diffusion is due to wave-particle interactions and radial diffusion to interactions with large-scale fluctuations in the Earth’s magnetic and electric fields. The diffusion coefficients are based on statistical wave models derived from data. Depending on the choice of the diffusion coefficients, the Fokker-Planck equation can be linear, quasi-linear, or nonlinear.\nLet us make our lives even simpler by considering only the radial diffusion and loss term. The quasi-linear assumptions are:\n\nBroadband wave spectrum (with random phase), typically assumed as a Gaussian centered around a single dominant mode\nLow amplitude fluctuations (no nonlinear interactions)\n“Resonance limit” (linear growth rate of instabilities goes to 0)\nULF wave-particle interactions lumped into the diffusion coefficient\n\nEven when quasi-linear theory works fine, there are multiple sources of uncertainties in the radial diffusion coefficient:\n\nBackground magnetic field model\nBounce + drift average eliminates MLT dependence\nAzimuthal wave structure (i.e. power distribution over mode numbers)\n\nGiven the limited observation data, we want to estimate the unknown parameters \\(D_{LL}, \\tau_L\\). This is called an inverse problem. In 2000, Brautigam and Albert proposed a dependence of the radial diffusion coefficent on \\(K_p\\) and L: \\[\nD_{LL} \\approx 10^{-0.506 K_p(t) - 9.325}L^10\n\\]\nThe standard statistical approach is to apply a Bayesian parameter estimation, where we are looking for a distribution of parameters and correcting results based on new observations. However, it is difficult to apply in high dimensions, which typically requires the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. For example, our assumption is that the parameters can be written in the following forms: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{LL}(L, t) &= 10^(a K_p(t) + b)L^c \\\\\n\\tau_L(L, t) &= \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{lr}\n(a_0 + a_1 L + a_2 L^2) / K_p(t) & \\text{for } L\\le L_{pp} \\\\ a_3 / K_p(t) & \\text{for } L &gt; L_{pp}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(L_{pp}\\) is the plasmapause location, which can be estimated with some approximations. We introduce a bunch of random variables, and the posterior distributions of these variables after MCMC give us the best fits.\nA new trend is to use physics-informed machine learning to learn the coefficients. First we may need to constrain the forms of the coefficients to avoid an ill-posed inverse problem. Let the physical loss term be described by a drift coefficient \\(C\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = L^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\mu,J}\\left( \\frac{D_{LL}}{L^2}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L}\\bigg\\rvert_{\\mu,J} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial Cf}{\\partial L}\n\\]\nThe job of Physical-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is to deduce the optimal \\(D_{LL}\\) and \\(C\\) based on statistics by embedding the expected form of the equation into the loss term in the neural network. As this is statistics, we can build and test any kind of relations between variables without physical interpretation, which has been critizised a lot. For example, one may ask how you can let the phase space distribution \\(f\\) depend only on \\(t\\) and \\(L\\)? The information is incomplete from a physics point of view, but datawise it may just “work”, in the sense that neural network is essentially a universal high-dimensional function approximator.\n\n24.2.1 Coupling physical processes at different time scales\nIf we only look at low frequency regime, the high frequency wave-particle interactions behave as a diffusion process to the plasma. Thus the coupling idea is not to simulate everything on the same time scale, but simulate the radiation belt effect by macroscopic diffusion coefficients.",

    "text": "25.1 Auroral Light Emission\nThere are numerous ancient legends and beliefs about the aurora from various parts of the world. Many of the mythological ideas, as well as more scientific theories from the eighteenth century, explained the aurora as sunlight reflected, refracted, or scattered by various divine or natural processes. Observations reveal that it consists of discrete spectral lines, which proves that auroral light is emitted by a gas, and rules out reflected or scattered sunlight. The strongest line the auroral spectrum is found to be \\(557.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\).\nAuroras are caused by charged particles with energy in the range from 10 eV to 30 keV. These particles collide in the upper atomosphere with atoms and molecules that are left in an excited state after the collision. About 90% of the aurora is caused by electrons, and the rest by protons. At altitudes about 100 km where most of the auroral light is emitted, the atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen as shown in Fig. ???. In these gases the quantum mechanically allowed transitions that produce strong spectral lins are all outside the visible part of the spectrum — otherwise air would not be transparent and colourless. The visible auroral emissions are due to transitions from forbidden metastable states, with low transition probabilities and long lifetimes. If the gas pressure is too high, these metastable states will relax to the ground state through collisions long before they decay by emitting light. However, at altitudes above 100 km collisions are sufficiently rare to allow the decay of an excited state of atomic oxygen. This state has an excitation energy of 4.17 eV and a lifetime of 0.8 s. It decays in a two step process. The green line is emitted in the first step, which takes the atom to a state at 1.96 eV. This intermediate state has a very long lifetime, 110 s, and the the red line emission at 630.0 nm that takes it to the ground state mainly occurs at altitudes above 200 km. This red line can also be produced by direct excitation to the state at 1.96 eV by collisions with low energy electrons. Other strong lines in the auroral spectrum are emitted by nitrogen. Molecular \\(\\mathrm{N}_2^+\\) ions are created in an excited state by collisions, and they decay to their ground state by emitting a bluish-voilet line at 427.8 nm. Sometimes the lowest part of strong auroras are colored red by emissions near 600 nm from neutral \\(\\mathrm{N}_2\\) molecules.\nFigure 25.1 shows the typical altitude distribution of the auroral emissions. The cross section for excitation of the different lines depends on the energy of the incoming auroral particles. Usually, the precipitating particles have higher energy at night than during the day. Low energy electrons give up their energy at higher altitudes, and produces more red emissions. Another difference between day and night is that resonant scattering by sunlight enhances the \\(\\mathrm{N}_2^+\\) line 427.8 nm relative to the green line.",

    "section": "25.2 Diffuse Aurora",
    "text": "25.2 Diffuse Aurora\nSome diffuse aurora is nearly always found in the auroral zone. On a clear and dark night it is often seen as a diffuse band, which may appear gray if the intensity is below the color threshold of the eye. Even if no aurora can be seen from the ground, we know from satellite observations of precipitating particles and auroral spectral lines in the UV-range that the diffuse aurora forms a rather continuous band aroud the auroral zone.\nMagnetosheath particles that enter through the magnetopause cusps are a source of diffuse aurora on the dayside. In the cusps there are field lines that connect the ionosphere to the magnetosheath, and magnetosheath particles with sufficiently small pitch angles will precipitate along these field lines. Around local noon, there will be a continuous flux of low energy (\\(\\le 100\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\)) particles, which at altitudes above 200 km cause a diffuse band of emissions at 630 nm.\nOn the nightside, and far into the evening and morning, diffuse auroras are caused by particles of plasmasheet origin. The energy spectrum of these particles extends from below 100 eV to above 20 keV. The continuous precipitation of electrons from the plasmasheet presents a problem, which has not been completely solved yet. Most of the plasmasheet is on closed field lines, and the loss cone in a stationary magnetosphere should be empty (because particles will be lost). To explain the diffuse aurora, we need some mechanisms that can scatter the particles into the loss cone.\nPlasma waves in the equatorial magnetosphere can cause strong pitch-angle scattering if they are resonant with the particles. Resonant in this context means that the parallel velocity of the particle and the phase velocity of the wave are related so that the particle feels an electric field that oscillates at the gyrofrequency. Significant changes in the velocities of the particles occur since they systematically gain or lose energy while they are resonant. At least for electrons with energy higher than a few keV, the required pitch-angle scattering can be provided by a type of waves in the whistler mode, known as magnetospheric hiss. However, the phase velocity of whistler mode waves may be too high to give resonance with lower energy electrons. Low energy electrons can be scattered efficiently by waves in the upper hybrid mode. Upper hybrid waves are electrostatic waves, but it is not clear that these waves are sufficiently common to explain the diffuse precipitation of low energy electrons.",

    "text": "25.3 Auroral Waves and Ion Heating\nPlasma waves play several roles on the auroral stage. As we have seen, waves near the equator provide the pitch angle scattering that causes diffuse aurora. Closer to Earth there are several types of plasma waves that are generated by the intense flux of particles precipitating into the aurora.\nDiscrete auroras are strong sources of whistler modes that appear rather different from whistlers generated by lightning. The auroral emissions are characterized by a broadband spectrum covering frequencies from a few kHz to hundreds of kHz, and they are continously generated with only slow amplitude variations. If the signal is amplified and connected to a loudspeaker a hissing noise is heard, and these waves are called auroral hiss. The auroral hiss propagates from the upper ionosphere to the equatorial magnetosphere where it contributes to the magnetospheric hiss. Auroral hiss also propagates to the ground, and at auroral latitudes it will cause noise in radio receivers tuned to low frequencies.\nAn interesting wave emission connected to discrete auroral arcs is called Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR). This is an intense radio wave radiation with peak intensity at frequencies just below 300 kHz, corresponding to a kilometric wavelength. However, the frequency can vary from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. The AKR is generated by a mechanism involving subtle relativistic effects ina low density plasma at a frequency very close to the local electron gyrofrequency. The highest frequencies are generated cloeet to Earth, where the magnetic field is strongest.The maximum power transmitted as AKR has been estimated to 1 GW, which makes auroras the strongest sources of radio waves from Earth. EM radiation at these frequencies can propagate freely out of the magnetosphere where the density is low, but it will be reflected from the ionosphere at the level where the wave frequency equals \\(\\omega_{pe}\\). Hence, AKR signals cannot be received on the ground, and although these emissions are very strong they were not discovered until 1965. In fact, the corresponding auroral emission from Jupiter, which is known as Jovian decametric radiation and has higher frequency, was observed by radio astronomers ten years earlier.\nElectrostatic plasma oscillations and other electrostatic waves are also generated above auroral arcs. Electrostatic waves with low frequencies, in the vicinity of the ion gyrofrequencies, have important effects on the magnetospheric dynamics. These waves are generated by the auroral electrons, but they are damped by the ions. The wave energy absorbed by the ions goes mainly into their perpendicular velocities. The magnetic moment then increases, and the ions are pushed out of the ionosphere by the magnetic mirror force \\(\\mu\\nabla B\\). This process can cause a flow of at least \\(10^{25}\\,O^+\\) per second from the auroral ionosphere during times of auroral activity. This flow gives the magnetosphere a significant content of ionospheric particles, and reduces the plasma density in the upper ionosphere above auroral arcs. In the auroral cavity dug out by ion heating the electron density is often about \\(3\\times10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\) down to altitudes below \\(1\\,\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\), at least when the ionosphere is in darkness. This density reduction is essential for the generation of AKR, and as we shall see also for the generation of discrete auroras.",

    "section": "25.4 Substorms and Discrete Aurora",
    "text": "25.4 Substorms and Discrete Aurora\nMagnetospheric substorms arise due to an imbalance between the dayside and nightside reconnection rates. As a simple example, this can arise during a sudden rotation of the IMF from northward to southward. A southward IMF leads to an increased reconnection rate at the magnetopause. More plasma and more magnetic flux is then transported to the magnetotail in \\(\\mathcal{O}(10^2)\\,\\mathrm{s}\\), and the pressure in the tail lobes increases. The plasmasheet is compressed, which on the ground can be seen as an equatorward motion and brightening of a pre-existing diffuse arc. The increased precipitation from the squeezed plasmasheet will also intensify ion heating, which leads to lower densities in the upper ionosphere above the auroral arc. As the density of the cross tail current increases and the neutral sheet becomes thinner, an unstable situation builds up. At this stage, reconnection starts in some part of the tail (Figure 25.2). This marks the onset of a magnetospheric substorm, and the process of storing energy in the magnetotail described above is often called the substorm growth phase.\nThe original usage of “substorm” comes from Akasofu and Chapman (1961), and was used to describe the short-term magnetic variations during the main phase of a magnetic storm. The current definition did not develop until a decade later, after it became clear that substorms and storms were distinctly different geomagnetic phenomena. The collection of phenomena that includes auroral breakup and expansion, the substorm current wedge, near-Earth dipolarization, and Pi2 pulsations, became collectively known as the magnetospheric substorm.\nThe concept of the substorm current wedge (SCW) has played an important role in understanding the coupling of the magnetotail to the ionosphere during substorms. It provides a simple explanation for the magnetic perturbations observed at mid and low latitudes during substorms, and is useful in understanding the magnetic variations seen in the auroral zone. In its simplest form, a model of the current wedge consists of a single loop with line currents into and out of the ionosphere on dipole field lines connected by a westward ionospheric line current and by an eastward magnetospheric line current (Figure 25.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.2: A schematic view of the essential physical elements of magnetospheric substorm processes on the Earth’s nightside. This includes magnetotail current systems, the near-Earth neutral line region, and reconfiguring magnetic fields in the substorm current wedge as suggested by the near-Earth neutral line model.\n\n\n\nWhen the magnetic field lines in the tail start to reconnect, part of the plasmasheet will be ejected from the tail and flow Earthward with a speed that often exceeds 400 km/s. The braking of this flow at the inner edge of the plasmasheet requires a substantial \\(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) force, and hence a substantial dusk-to-dawn current, which leads to dipolarization of the inner portion of the magnetic field. At the edges of the injection region, this current is diverted into field-aligned currents that drive the auroral electrojet, a strong westward current in the ionosphere. Note that the auroral electrojet via Ohm’s law implies a westward electric field and an equatorward flow of the ionospheric plasma. Flows from the reconnection region and dipolarization of the magnetic field are associated with field-aligned currents coupling to the ionosphere, whose net effect is then the SCW. This sequence of changes, from energy storage through explosive release, is called a magnetospheric substorm. The reconnection process is temporally and spatially varying, which structures the flows in scale sizes of the order of a few \\(\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\) and time scales of a few minutes.\nField-aligned auroral currents in the ionosphere are observed to have current densities of \\(10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}/\\mathrm{m}^2\\). Considering only field-aligned currents, the current density must decrease higher up where the flux tube widens. At altitudes around \\(1\\,\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\) the current density is still about \\(1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}/\\mathrm{m}^2\\). In the auroral cavity where the electron density \\(n_e\\) is about \\(3\\times10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\), we can estimate the velocity the electrons must have to carry this current as \\(v_\\parallel=j_\\parallel/en_e \\sim 2\\times10^7\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\\), which corresponds to a kinetic energy slightly higher than 1 keV. When the fast flow injected from the tail by reconnection is stopped, the field-aligned current is carried by electrons that must be accelerated to keV energies. These electrons will cause aurora, and the sudden buildup of this current leads to a breakup of the quiet auroral arc that existed during the growth phase of the substorm.\nThe auroral breakup occurs in the region of upward field-aligned current, at the western end of the electrojet. The upward current is carried by downgoing electrons that have been accelerated by \\(E_\\parallel\\) at altitudes around \\(1\\,\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{E}\\). When these electrons start to precipitate, a very bright and dynamic auroral display begins. A suitably located observer may see a large part of the sky filled with rapidly moving auroral forms. As illustrated in the classical drawings of an auroral substorm shown by Akasofu 1968 (viewing from the north pole), the aurora spreads poleward, and after a few minutes more stable discrete auroral arcs start to form.\nThe inertia of the plasma flowing in from the tail with high speed will carry it into a region where the ambient, mainly magnetic, pressure is higher than the pressure in the injected plasma. As the inflow continues the pressure increases, and the injected plasma will start to expand towards the evening and morning side of the magnetosphere. This happens somewhat further from Earth where the ambient magnetic pressure is lower, on field lines that reach the ionosphere poleward of the initial breakup. The azimuthal plasma flows associated with this expansion cause the discrete arcs that form poleward of the breakup.\nThe simple substorm current wedge model described here is only a crude approximation to the currents that actually exist in space. It is generally believed that the upward current is localized in the premidnight sector while the downward current is more broadly distributed along the auroral oval post-midnight.1 Upward currents are carried by downward moving electrons, while the downward current is a combination of upward flowing electrons and precipitating ions. The actual currents probably do not flow on the same L-shells. It has also been suggested that the current wedge includes currents closing in meridian planes. In this more complex model there is a second current wedge of opposite sense flowing on a lower L-shell with a different current strength. The effect of this loop on the ground is to reduce the apparent strength of the higher latitude current wedge.\nThe Dungey cycle is the source of the two-cell (DP-2) ionospheric convection pattern. Intervals of steady magnetospheric convection, where the dayside and nightside reconnection rates are roughly balanced, approach the idealized state originally envisioned by Dungey (1961). Yet reconnection is not a steady process, and even during intervals of SMC, when the solar wind driver is relatively constant, plasmasheet convection can be intermittent and bursty. Detailed examination of the responses reveals that a pair of field-aligned currents in the form of a current wedge forms during each of the phenomenological stages. Thus, the SCW system is a key phenomenon across all magnetospheric dynamics related to the Dungey cycle, present from weak to extreme activity conditions, and is the link between magnetospheric dynamics and the ionosphere.\n\n25.4.1 Knight’s relation\nBy studying the adiabatic motion of electrons in a parallel electric field, Knight [1973] derived a formula for the auroral current-voltage (C-V) relation. Analyzing data from sounding rockets, Lyons et al. [1979] found that the energy flux of precipitating electrons was proportional to the square of the potential drop. Soon after, it was noticed that for the parameters of interest in the upward current region, Knight’s relation could be approximated by [Fridman and Lemaire, 1980] (I feel like this is NOT the original Knight’s relation??? Kosta mentioned the linear relation between FAC and B?) \\[\nj_{z} \\approx -K \\Delta\\phi\n\\tag{25.1}\\] where \\(j_z\\) is the field-aligned current density below the potential drop and \\(\\Delta\\phi\\) is the potential difference between the ionosphere and the equatorial magnetosphere. The constant \\(K\\), known as the Lyons-Evans-Lundin constant, is given by \\[\nK=\\frac{n_{G}e^2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m T_G}}\n\\] where \\(N_G\\) and \\(T_G\\) are the density and temperature of electrons in the equatorial generator region. Notice that since \\(N_G\\) and \\(T_G\\) may vary in space and time, the term “constant” in this context means “independent of \\(\\phi\\)”. The linear C-V relation Equation 25.1 has since been adopted as a part of theoretical and numerical models. However, there are observations both support and against this relation.\nUsing a fluid description of the plasma, Rönnmark [1999] showed that within a purely electrostatic quasineutral model the potential drop should be proportional to the square of the upward field-aligned current \\[\n\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{m_e}{2e^3}\\frac{j_z^3}{n^2}\n\\tag{25.2}\\] where \\(n\\) is the density in the acceleration region above the ionosphere.\n\n\n25.4.2 Current circuit\nThe current circuit connected with a discrete auroral arc is shown in Figure 25.3. Comparing with Figure 25.2 we see that the flows have been rotated from radial to azimuthal. The length scales are also different, since the auroral electrojet is hundreds of kilometers long and the ionospheric current in Figure 25.3 which runs across an auroral arc is at most a few km. Still the physics is very similar. When pointing out some details, we will here use the geometry shown in Figure 25.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.3: Geometry of the auroral current circuit and the generator region in the equatorial magnetosphere.\n\n\n\nLet us assume that the auroral flux tube, extending from the ionosphere to the equatorial plane, can be separated into three parts.\n\nAt low altitudes we have the collision dominated ionosphere, where field-aligned currents are connected to horizontal currents.\nThe magnetospheric plasma above the ionosphere is collisionless. In a stationary state, and in the absence of collisions, the magnetic moment \\(\\mu\\) and the total energy \\(H\\) are conserved along the phase-space trajectory of a particle. These assumptions imply that there are no currents perpendicular to the magnetic field lines (???), and the field-aligned current in a flux tube is conserved in the second, main, part of the flux tube.\nThe third part is the equatorial generator region. Perpendicular currents are in the generator region driven by kinetic and dynamic pressure gradients, and the divergence of these perpendicular currents is diverted to field-aligned currents. In the real magnetosphere the boundaries between these parts may be rather diffuse, and the generator region may extend far from the equatorial plane.\n\nFor simplicity we assume that the main part of an auroral flux tube is separated from the ionosphere and the generator region by well-defined boundaries. Because of quasineutrality, the density of the light and mobile electrons is determined by the ion density. The ion density will remain approximately constant during transitions between different stationary states. Such transitions, for example increases of the field-aligned current, are accomplished by shear Alfvén waves propagating up and down the field lines. The time variation of \\(E_\\perp\\) associated with these Alfvén waves will cause an ion polarization current \\(j_\\perp\\) given by \\[\nk_\\perp = \\frac{n_i m_i}{B^2}\\frac{\\partial E_\\perp}{\\partial t}\n\\]\nCombining this with the ion continuity equation \\[\ne\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t} \\approx -\\partial_\\perp j_\\perp = \\frac{n_i m_i}{B^2}\\frac{\\partial \\partial_\\perp E_\\perp}{\\partial t}\n\\] we can integrate to find the density change \\(\\Delta n_i\\) during the growth of \\(E_\\perp\\). Let \\(L_\\perp\\) be the thickness of the current sheet that \\(j_\\perp\\) connects to. Choosing \\(E_\\perp=0.1\\,\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{m}\\) and \\(B=10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{T}\\) as typical values for the auroral acceleration region we find \\[\n\\bigg\\lvert \\frac{\\Delta n_i}{n_i} \\bigg\\rvert \\sim \\frac{m_i}{eB^2}|\\partial_\\perp E_\\perp| \\sim \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m}}{L_\\perp}\n\\]\nClearly, this process can increase the plasma density significantly only within extremely thin current sheets. On the other hand, if the current sheet has a thickness of a few hundred meters or more, the density will remain almost constant. Hence, it seems reasonable to consider the plasma density in the main part of the flux tube as fixed when the current and voltage vary.\nIn a state of steady field-aligned current the contribution to the current by ions of mass \\(m_i\\) is about a factor \\(\\sqrt{m_e/m_i}\\) smaller than the contribution by electrons of mass \\(m_e\\). If we as a first approximation consider this ratio as fixed, the ion and electron currents are separately conserved. In the main part of the flux tube, where the current is purely field-aligned, the plasma density will then be unaffected by the presence of a steady current. However, altitude variations in plasma properties such as ion composition and electron and ion temperatures may cause variations in the ratio between ion and electron current, and this will cause slow decreases or increases of the plasma density.\nPressure forces in the equatorial plane try to establish a strong velocity shear \\(\\partial_x u_y\\), which implies a strong \\(\\partial_x E_x\\) in Figure 25.3 (\\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\)). Recalling eq-ionosphere_potential_derivation we find that the gradient of the ionospheric electric field is determined by the field-aligned current as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{j_z}{\\Sigma_P}\n\\]\nAs long as there is no potential drop along the field lines, the magnetospheric and ionospheric electric fields are simply related, and the mapping of a strong velocity shera in the equatorial plane to the ionosphere demands a strong field-aligned current. However, a strong current through the auroral cavity means that the electrons must be accelerated by a potential drop (e.g. Equation 25.2).\nThe appearance of this potential drop on field lines that carry currents up from the ionosphere means that the ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields become decoupled. The frozen-in condition does not hold in the acceleration region, and this breakdown of ideal MHD also means that the equatorial plasma is free to flow without dragging the ionosphere along. The potential drop \\(\\Delta\\phi\\) limits the current density, and hence the braking \\(\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) force. Notice that it is the low altitude acceleration in this potential drop, which in the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons is observed as a peak at the energy \\(e\\Delta\\phi\\), that distinguishes the discrete from the diffuse aurora.\nThe field lines carrying current up from the ionosphere connect to regions with a strong inward gradient of the driving force, which is the outer part of the volume with enhanced pressure. When the brakes in this region are released, the flow will build up a narrower region of high pressure at larger \\(y\\). ??? Only the outer part of this smaller volume will continue to expand, and this process quickly creates a narrow flow channel in the \\(y\\)-direction. The outer edge of this channel maps to a discrete auroral arc in the ionosphere.\nIn the model described above, the flows are constrained to the \\(y\\)-direction. In the real magnetosphere, the flows can be deviated in the radial \\(x\\)-direction to form curls and vortices. As illustrated by Akasofu, the geometry of real auroral arcs is very complicated. The patterns are similar to the turbulence seen when water flows from a river into a lake.\nI still have many questions regarding the substorms and SCW. Reading the review by (Kepko et al. 2015) makes things worse: my impression is that there has not yet existed a model for explaining the whole current system. No wonder the sawtooth study with MHD-EPIC ended up in a strange way.\n\n\n25.4.3 Omega Band Auroras\nAuroral luminosity undulations of the poleward boundaries of diffuse auroras were first described by Akasofu and Kimball (1964) and were named “omega bands” due to the similarity of their shapes to inverted (poleward-opening) versions of the Greek letter Ω. Omega bands are generally observed in the post-midnight and morning sectors during the recovery phases of magnetospheric substorms. They typically have sizes of 400–1000 km and usually drift eastward at speeds of 0.3–2 km/s.\n\n\n25.4.4 Theta Auroras\nTheta auroras (transpolar aurora arcs) are thought to be linked to high latitude reconnections, which typically happens under northward IMF conditions.\nIMF \\(B_y\\) may also contribute to theta auroras as the twist of magnetic field lines together with high latitude reconnections can lead to the strong aurora arcs.\n\n\n25.4.5 Throat Auroras\nThroat Auroras, named after the finger-like structure on the dayside, are thought to be caused by transient reconnection and magnetopause depression with large \\(B_x\\) in the cusp region.\n\n\n25.4.6 Pulsation Auroras",

    "text": "26.1.1 Lorentz equation in tensor form\nIn order to derive the Guiding Center Approximation (GCA), we would use the tensor notations in relativity. The equation of motion for a charged particle in an EM field are written in a tensorial form as \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} = F_{\\mu\\nu} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\n\\tag{26.1}\\] where \\(x_\\mu\\) is the particle four-coordinate, \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the EM tensor and \\(\\tau\\) is the particle proper time.\nThe EM tensor is \\[\nF_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{e}{mc}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & B_z & -B_y & E_x \\\\\n-B_z & 0 & B_x & E_y \\\\\nB_y & -B_x & 0 & E_z \\\\\nE_x & E_y & E_z & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{26.2}\\]\n\n\n26.1.2 Fundamental assumptions\nThe GC formalism holds under two fundamental assumptions, namely:\n\nThe gyration radius must remain small compared to the scale length upon which the electromagnetic field changes significantly.\nThe particle undergoes many gyrations before the electromagnetic field changes appreciably (slowl-varying fields pproximation). If we let \\(\\rho\\) be the particle gyroradius (apart from a factor √2), \\(x_\\mu\\) the particle position, \\(X_\\mu\\) the GC position, \\(\\tau\\) the proper time and \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) the EM field tensor, the two conditions stated above can be mathematically expressed as \\[\n\\rho \\left| \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\alpha} \\right| \\ll \\left| F_{\\mu\\nu} \\right|\n\\tag{26.3}\\] and \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\left| \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\alpha} \\right| \\left| \\frac{\\mathbf{d}X_\\beta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right| \\ll \\left| F_{\\mu\\nu} \\right|\n\\tag{26.4}\\] where \\(\\omega\\) is the gyrofrequency. When the previous conditions hold, we can separate the particle trajectory into a gyration and a motion of the guiding center.\n\n\n\n26.1.3 Derivations of GC equation\nThe general solution of Equation 26.1 is a linear combination of the two fundamental solutions related to the four EM tensor eigenvalues \\(q=\\pm i\\omega\\) and \\(q=\\pm\\lambda\\), where \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega &= \\frac{e}{mc}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}(B^2 - E^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(B^2 - E^2)^2 + 4(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B})^2}} \\\\\n\\lambda &= \\frac{e}{mc}\\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}(B^2 - E^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(B^2 - E^2)^2 + 4(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B})^2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.5}\\]\n\\(\\omega\\) is a generalized relativistic form of the Larmor frequency \\(\\omega_\\xi = eB/(mc)\\) in the case when \\(E\\neq 0\\) (which can be verified by solving in the limit \\(E\\to 0\\)). The general solution \\(x_\\mu\\) of Equation 26.1 is \\[\nx_\\mu = \\xi_\\mu\\rho \\cos(\\omega\\tau) - \\eta_\\mu \\rho \\sin(\\omega\\tau) + \\alpha_\\mu \\nu \\cosh(\\lambda\\tau) + \\beta_\\mu \\nu \\sinh(\\lambda\\tau)\n\\tag{26.6}\\]\nNote that the first two terms are related to a periodic motion, that is the gyration around magnetic field lines with gyroradius \\(\\rho\\). Here \\(\\rho, \\nu\\) are constants defined by the initial conditions and \\(\\xi_\\mu,\\eta_\\mu,\\alpha_\\mu\\) and \\(\\beta_\\mu\\) are four-versors normalized in the manner \\[\n\\xi_\\mu^2 = \\eta_\\mu^2 = 1,\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\alpha_\\mu^2 = -\\beta_\\mu^2 = 1\n\\tag{26.7}\\]\nSolutions for \\(\\rho = 0\\) and \\(\\nu = 0\\) must be valid separately, so by replacing \\(x_\\mu\\) for these two particular cases inside Equation 26.1 we can see that \\(\\xi_\\mu,\\eta_\\mu,\\alpha_\\mu\\) and \\(\\beta_\\mu\\) form an orthogonal set of the Minkowsky space. The orthogonality relations between this set of four-vectors in particular states that the periodic motion (gyration) in the \\((\\xi_mu,\\eta_\\mu)\\)-plane is perpendicular to the acceleration motion in the \\((\\alpha_\\mu, \\beta_\\mu)\\)-plane, and will be useful later. At this point, another useful relation is retrieved from the squared velocity invariance \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = -c^2,\\quad\\text{which leads to}\\quad \\omega^2\\rho^2 - \\lambda^2\\nu^2 = -c^2\n\\tag{26.8}\\]\nSince we are only interested in cases in which gyration appears, the only singular eigenvalue case we must consider is the one with \\(\\lambda=0, \\omega\\neq 0\\), corresponding to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0\\) and \\(|\\mathbf{E}|\\to 0\\). The associated solution is \\[\nx_\\mu = \\xi_\\mu\\rho \\cos(\\omega\\tau) - \\eta_\\mu \\rho \\sin(\\omega\\tau) + U_\\mu \\tau\n\\tag{26.9}\\]\nHere the gyration motion with Larmor frequency \\(\\omega_\\xi = \\omega\\) is clearly shown, along with a uniform motion (drift) with velocity \\(U_\\mu = (\\gamma c, \\mathbf{U})\\) in the plane perpendicular to the \\((\\mathbf{E}, \\mathbf{B})\\)-plane.1 In this particular case, the squared velocity invariance Equation 26.8 becomes \\[\n\\omega^2\\rho^2 + U_\\mu^2 = -c^2,\\quad\\text{or}\\quad U_\\mu^2 = -c^2 - \\omega^2\\rho^2 &lt; -c^2\n\\tag{26.10}\\]\nEquation 26.10 is of crucial importance in the GCA formalism, because the drift motion \\(U_\\mu\\) is the mean motion separated from the gyration and corresponds to the GC motion itself, meaning that what we just found is a relation between the energy and momentum of a particle guiding center. It is very similar to the well-known formula of the squared four-velocity \\({U_\\mu^\\prime}^2=-c^2\\), the only difference being an additional term \\(\\omega^2\\rho^2\\). This suggests interpreting the motion of the GC as the one of a particle located in the center of gyration, performing no gyration and possessing a squared four velocity as stated in Equation 26.10, in agreement with part of the particle kinetic energy being stored in the gyration motion through the term \\(\\omega^2\\rho^2\\). By separating the spatial and temporal parts of \\(U_\\mu\\) and rearranging some terms inside Equation 26.10, we can get a relation for the GC Lorentz factor \\[\n\\gamma_\\text{GC} = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{|\\mathbf{U}|^2}{c^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2\\rho^2}{c^2}} = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\gamma^2|\\mathbf{v}|^2}{c^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2\\rho^2}{c^2}}\n\\tag{26.11}\\]\nAlthough we only considered a limit case, the same equation can be proven to be generally valid in the GCA formalism.\nWe now want to isolate the gyration motion in a general case. This is done by separating the motion as follows: \\[\nx_\\mu = \\xi_\\mu x + \\eta_\\mu y + x_\\mu^\\prime + X_\\mu\n\\tag{26.12}\\] where \\(x_\\mu\\) is the space-time position of the particle and \\(X_\\mu\\) is the position of the guiding center. We associate two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to describe the periodic motion in the \\((\\xi, \\eta)\\)-plane, and the term \\(x_\\mu^\\prime\\) will account for the periodic motions which do not lie in the same plane. To more easily describe the gyration, we also choose a new pair of variables \\[\n\\zeta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( x+ iy \\right)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\zeta^\\ast = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( x - iy \\right)\n\\tag{26.13}\\] so that \\(\\xi_\\mu x + \\eta_\\mu y = \\delta_\\mu\\zeta + \\sigma_\\mu\\zeta^\\ast\\). The new variables will allow us to choose \\(\\zeta_\\mu\\) and \\(\\delta_\\mu\\) in a more convenient way and let some factor \\(e^{i\\phi}\\) account for the initial conditions of the problem. We rewrite the particle coordinate using Equation 26.13 \\[\nx_\\mu = \\delta_\\mu\\zeta + \\sigma_\\mu\\zeta^\\ast + x_\\mu^\\prime + X_\\mu\n\\tag{26.14}\\]\nThe next step is substituting this expression into Equation 26.1 and expand the second derivative, which leads to a lengthy expression containing eight unkowns: \\(\\zeta,\\zeta^\\ast\\), two components of \\(x_\\mu\\) (the condition with the \\((\\sigma, \\delta)\\)-plane sets the other two), and four components of \\(X_\\mu\\).\nThe conditions for the GCA expressed in Equation 26.4 implicitly contain a parameter of smallness \\(\\epsilon =|u/\\omega L|\\ll 1\\), where u is the typical particle four-velocity and L the scale length upon which the change in the EM fields \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is comparable to \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) (slowly-varying fields approximation). This allows us to approximate \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}(x_\\mu)\\) (particle coordinate) by using a Taylor expansion about \\(X_\\mu\\) (the GC coordinate) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{\\mu\\nu}(x_\\mu) =& F_{\\mu\\nu}(X_\\mu) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\xi}(\\delta_\\xi \\zeta + \\sigma_\\xi \\zeta^\\ast) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\xi\\partial x_\\pi}\\left[ \\delta_\\xi\\delta_\\pi \\zeta^2 + \\sigma_\\xi\\sigma_\\pi {\\zeta^\\ast}^2 + (\\sigma_\\xi \\delta_\\pi + \\sigma_\\pi \\delta_\\xi)|\\zeta|^2 \\right] \\\\\n&+ \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\xi} x_\\xi^\\prime + ...\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe should now substitute \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}(x_\\mu)\\) inside Equation 26.1 using the new coordinates in order to get a quite long equation containing all quantities evaluated at the GC position \\(X_\\mu\\) up to 2nd−order, and group all 2nd−order terms on the right-end side as \\(G_\\mu\\) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\delta_\\mu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} + \\sigma_\\mu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\zeta^\\ast}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}+\\left( i\\omega\\delta_\\mu + 2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\\\\n&+\\left( -i\\omega\\sigma_\\mu + 2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta^\\ast}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\delta_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}\\zeta + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\sigma_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}\\zeta^\\ast \\\\\n&- \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\xi}\\left( \\delta_\\xi \\zeta + \\sigma_\\xi \\zeta^\\ast \\right)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} - F_{\\mu\\nu}\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\delta_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\zeta + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\zeta^\\ast \\right) \\\\\n&- \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\xi}\\left( \\delta_\\xi \\zeta + \\sigma_\\xi \\zeta^\\ast \\right) \\left( \\delta_\\nu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + \\sigma_\\nu\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta^\\ast}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right) \\\\\n&+ \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 X_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} - F_{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{d^2 x_\\mu^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} - F_{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_\\nu^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right) = G_\\mu\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.15}\\]\nAn expression for \\(\\zeta\\) is needed to further proceed, but since the derivation is quite long we will not explicitly derive it here. The basic idea is to use the orthogonality equations for the new four-vectors \\(\\sigma_\\mu\\) and \\(\\delta_\\mu\\) and the antisymmetry property of the EM tensor inside Maxwell’s equations written in tensorial form, and then assume that a solution for \\(X_\\mu\\) has already been found. Considered that \\(x_\\mu\\) is a 1st−order term in the GCA, by ignoring 2nd−order quantities and writing terms independent from \\(\\zeta\\) as a numerical value \\(P\\), then Equation 26.15 becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} + i\\Omega\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + \\frac{i}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Omega}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\zeta + \\Omega a \\zeta + P = 0\n\\tag{26.16}\\] where \\(\\Omega a \\zeta\\) contains all the linear terms in \\(\\zeta\\). Consequently, the corresponding solution \\(\\zeta\\), by analogy to the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation in quantum mechanics, is \\[\n\\zeta = \\rho_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_0}{\\Omega}}\\exp\\left[ -i\\left( \\Phi + \\int_{\\tau_0}^\\tau \\sigma_1 \\mathrm{d}\\tau \\right) \\right]\n\\tag{26.17}\\] to the 0th-order, being \\[\n\\Omega = \\omega - 2i\\sigma_\\mu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\delta_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau},\\quad \\Phi = \\int_{\\tau_0}^{\\tau}\\Omega\\mathrm{d}\\tau - \\phi,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sigma = a - \\frac{a^2}{\\Omega}\n\\tag{26.18}\\] The subscripts 0, 1 indicate the associated order of approximation for quantities defined above.\nSince now we know the expression for \\(\\zeta\\), we can write the 1st−order EOM for \\(X_\\mu\\). For this purpose, we require that in the left-end side of Equation 26.15 the terms containing the 1st− and 2nd−order derivatives of \\(X_\\mu\\) are balanced by the remaining nonoscillatory terms, that is \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 X_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} - F_{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_\\xi}\\left( \\delta_\\xi \\sigma_\\nu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta^\\ast}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + \\delta_\\nu \\sigma_\\xi \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\zeta}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right)\n\\tag{26.19}\\]\nHaving found the solution Equation 26.17 and making use once again of the orthogonality relations for \\(\\delta_\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\mu\\) and the tensorial Maxwell’s equations, we can write the equation of motion for the GC \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 X_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} - F_{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + \\rho_0^2 \\omega_0\\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial x_\\mu} = 0\n\\tag{26.20}\\] where \\(\\omega\\) (Equation 26.5) is the generalized Larmor frequency, \\(\\rho_0^2 \\omega_0 = \\mu_0 = mc\\gamma^2 v_\\perp^2 / 2eB\\) is the 0th-order approximation (apart from a constant factor) to the particle magnetic moment \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\omega_0 = eB/(mc)\\) represents the lowest-order approximation to the Larmor frequency in the case \\(E\\ll B\\).\nMore precisely, the magnetic moment should be regarded as constant only in the reference frame moving at \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\), because in that particular case \\(\\mathbf{E} = 0\\). Indeed, a formal analysis (Northrop and Teller (1960)) shows that the corresponding constant of motion in a general reference frame is actually an asymptotic series expansion in a smallness parameter \\(\\epsilon=u/(\\omega_0 L)\\) in the form \\(\\mu = (e/c)\\left[ \\mu_0 + \\epsilon \\mu_1 + \\epsilon^2 \\mu_2 + ... \\right]\\) so that \\(\\mu_0\\) is not constant and can still vary in compliance with the adiabatic theory. Nevertheless, extensive numerical testing confirms that the errors due to assuming \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mu_0 / \\mathrm{d}t \\approx 0\\) are at most of the same order of those introduced by the GC formalism, as a consequence of the slowly varying field condition which prevents sensible changes in the magnetic moment. Hence, we safely assume that \\(\\mu \\approx (e/c)\\mu_0\\) is invariant.\n\n\n26.1.4 First order solution for the GCA equations of motion\nAlthough deceitful simple, the GC equation of motion Equation 26.20 is more conveniently cast in a form in which the GC velocity appears explicitly, under the nearly-crossed (EM) fields condition \\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{E}_\\parallel \\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{B^2 - E_\\perp^2} \\ll 1\n\\tag{26.21}\\] where the subscripts \\(\\parallel\\) and \\(\\perp\\) indicate the parallel and perpendicular components of the electric field with respect to the magnetic field unit vector \\(\\hat{b}\\). It can be proven that Equation 26.21 allows the EM tensor field \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) to be split into a contribution \\(F_{\\mu\\ni}^{(0)}\\) constructed solely from \\(\\mathbf{E}_\\perp\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), plus a correction term \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}^{(1)}\\) depending on \\(\\mathbf{E}_\\parallel\\). A formal analysis leads to the conclusion that the GC four-velocity \\(U_\\mu \\equiv \\mathrm{d}X_\\mu/\\mathrm{d}\\tau\\) can be decomposed into a 0th-order contribution \\(\\mathrm{U}^{(0)}\\) (which contains the drift velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_E = c\\mathbf{E}_\\perp \\times\\mathbf{B}/B^2\\) as well as the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field line \\(v_\\parallel \\hat{b}\\)) plus 1st-order correction \\(\\mathbf{U}^{(1)}\\), leading to \\[\nU_\\mu = (\\gamma c, \\mathbf{U}) \\simeq (\\gamma c, \\gamma v_\\parallel \\hat{b} + \\gamma \\mathbf{v}_E + \\mathbf{U}^{(1)})\n\\tag{26.22}\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) is the particle Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma = (1- v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}\\). An equation for \\(\\mathbf{U}^{(1)}\\) can be derived from Equation 26.20 using a recursive approach as shown below, while from the spatial component one obtains an equation (to the same order) for the parallel component of the GC four-velocity \\(\\gamma v_\\parallel\\). These yield the (1st-order) GCA system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{X}}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\mathbf{v}_E + v_\\parallel \\hat{b} + \\frac{\\gamma_E^2}{B}\\hat{b}\\times\\left[ \\frac{mc\\gamma}{e}\\left( v_\\parallel\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{b}) + \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{v}_E) \\right) + \\mathcal{M}\\left( \\frac{B}{\\gamma_E} \\right) + \\frac{v_\\parallel E_\\parallel}{c}\\mathbf{v}_E \\right] \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\gamma v_\\parallel)}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{e}{m}E_\\parallel - \\gamma\\hat{b}\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{v}_E) - \\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma m}\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B}{\\gamma_E}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.23}\\] where \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{X}/\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathbf{U}^{(1)}/\\gamma\\) represents the velocity of the guiding center, \\(e/m\\) is the particle charge-to-mass ratio and \\(\\mu_0 = c\\mu/e\\). The operators \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) are defined as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}(x) &= \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial t} + v_\\parallel(\\hat{b}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{x} + (\\mathbf{v}_E\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{x} \\\\\n\\mathcal{M}(x) &= \\frac{\\mu}{e\\gamma}\\left[ \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_E}{c}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} + c\\nabla x \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.24}\\] where \\(\\gamma_E = (1 - E_\\perp^2/B^2)^{-1/2}\\) is the Lorentz factor associated to the drift velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\).\nIn the GCA Equation 26.23 information about motion perpendicular to the magnetic field is lost and the only component of the particle velocity that is actually evolved in time is \\(u_\\parallel\\), because the magnetic moment \\(\\mu_0\\approx c\\mu/e\\) is now considered a constant of motion. Each term on the right hand side of Equation 26.23 corresponds to a specific drift motion. Indeed, the first term represents the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) perpendicular drift, while the second one accounts for particle motion in the direction parallel to magnetic field. The first two terms in square bracket, \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{b})\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{v}_E)\\), describe the field curvature and polarization drifts2, respectively. The next term is the \\(\\nabla-B\\) drift, while the last one represents a relativistic drift in the direction given by \\(\\hat{b}\\times\\mathbf{v}_E\\).\nEquation 26.23 lose their validity when either \\(B\\to 0\\) (magnetic null) or \\(E_\\perp \\ge B\\), i.e. when the nearly-crossed EM fields condition, Equation 26.21, is violated. While the first condition can easily occur inside a current sheet, the second may occur in a non-ideal MHD regime only. Violation of either condition breaks down the GCA and can lead to severe numerical errors.\n\n\n26.1.5 Recursive solution\nAn explicit solution for Equation 26.20 can be found under Equation 26.21, which introduces a new parameter of smallness \\(\\lambda / \\omega \\ll 1\\).\n\n\n26.1.6 Energy conservation\nThe time component of Equation 26.20 leads to an evolutionary ODE for the particle energy as a function of time, namely \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma c^2}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{e}{m}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{X}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\cdot\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\mu}{m}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{B}{\\gamma_E} \\right)\n\\tag{26.25}\\]\nIn the time-independent case, Equation 26.25 clearly shows that, when the GC velocity is perpendicular to the electric field, no acceleration occurs and the particle energy is conserved. For numerical purposes, however, Equation 26.25 is not solved for retrieving the Lorentz \\(\\gamma\\)-factor, since large values of the right hand side could easily violate the condition \\(\\gamma\\ge 1\\) at the truncation level of the scheme, unless small time steps are taken. In practice, to an 1st-order approximation, the particle velocity can be decomposed into a parallel component \\(v_\\parallel\\), a drift component \\(v_E\\) and a gyration component \\(v_\\perp\\). This leads to the normalization condition \\[\n\\gamma^2( c^2 - v_\\parallel^2 - v_\\perp^2 - v_E^2) = c^2\n\\tag{26.26}\\]\nFrom the definition of the magnetic moment and the Larmor frequency \\(\\mu_0 = mc\\gamma^2 v_\\perp^2/(2eB) = \\gamma^2 v_\\perp^2/(2\\omega_0)\\), we compute the particle Lorentz factor as \\[\n\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{c^2 + \\gamma^2 v_\\parallel^2 + 2\\mu_0 \\omega_0}{c^2 - v_E^2}}\n\\tag{26.27}\\]\nEquation 26.27 replaces Equation 26.25 in common numerical solvers to get the Lorentz factor.\n\n\n26.1.7 Numerical implementation\nThe GCA Equation 26.23 contains a set of 4 ODEs with unknowns \\((\\mathbf{X}, u_\\parallel)\\).

    "section": "26.2 Hamiltonian Theory of Guiding Center Motion",
    "text": "26.2 Hamiltonian Theory of Guiding Center Motion\nFollowing the review by Cary and Brizard (2009).\nCanonical and noncanonical Hamiltonian formulations of guiding-center motion offer improvements over non-Hamiltonian formulations: Hamiltonian formulations possess Noether’s theorem (hence invariants follow from symmetries), and they preserve the Poincaré invariants (so that spurious attractors are prevented from appearing in simulations of guiding-center dynamics). Hamiltonian guiding-center theory is guaranteed to have an energy conservation law for time-independent fields—something that is not true of non-Hamiltonian guiding-center theories. The use of the phase-space Lagrangian approach facilitates this development, as there is no need to transform a priori to canonical coordinates, such as flux coordinates, which have less physical meaning.\n\n26.2.1 Noncanonical Hamiltonian guiding center theory\nThe guiding-center phase space consists of\n\nthe guiding-center position \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), essentially the center of the helix;\nthe guiding-center parallel velocity variable \\(u\\equiv \\hat{b}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\);\nthe (lowest-order) magnetic moment, \\[\n\\mu \\equiv \\frac{m |\\mathbf{w}|^2}{2B(\\mathbf{X}, t)}\n\\tag{26.29}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{v}_\\perp - \\mathbf{v}_E\\) is the perpendicular velocity in the local frame moving with the \\(\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) drift velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\equiv c\\mathbf{E}\\times\\hat{b}/B\\).\nand the ignorable gyrophase \\(\\zeta\\), which gives the location of the particle on the circle about the guiding center.\n\nAs there are still six variables parametrizing phase space, there is no loss of information in making the guiding-center transformation \\((\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v}) \\to (\\mathbf{X},u,\\mu,\\zeta)\\). For the sake of simplicity of notation, we occasionally use the gyroaction variable \\(J \\equiv mc/e\\mu\\) instead of the magnetic moment \\(\\mu\\) whenever we need to refer to the action-angle coordinates \\(J,\\zeta\\) associated with gyromotion.\nThe equations of motion for these variables are given by the guiding-center phase-space Lagrangian, \\[\n\\mathcal{L}_\\text{gc}(\\mathbf{X},u,\\mu,\\zeta;t) = \\left[ \\frac{e}{c}\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{X},t) + mu\\hat{b}(\\mathbf{X},t) \\right]\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} + J\\dot{\\zeta} - H_\\text{gc}\n\\tag{26.30}\\] in which the guiding-center Hamiltonian is given by \\[\nH_\\text{gc}(\\mathbf{X},u,\\mu;t) = \\frac{m}{2}u^2 + \\mu B(\\mathbf{X},t) + e\\phi(\\mathbf{X},t) - \\frac{m}{2}\\left| \\mathbf{v}_E \\right|^2\n\\tag{26.31}\\]\nThe arguments are shown here to emphasize that, for example, the magnetic-field strength \\(B(\\mathbf{X},t)\\) is evaluated at the guiding-center position \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), not at the particle position \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Here and throughout, the effects of a gravitational field may by found by adding the gravitational \\(m\\Phi_G\\) to the electrostatic potential energy \\(e\\Phi\\). In addition, we now drop the adjective phase space, as the guiding-center Lagrangian is always henceforth a phase-space Lagrangian.\nThe guiding-center Lagrangian Equation 26.30 comes not simply from gyrophase averaging, but from a transformation from the physical (particle) variables \\((\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v})\\) to the guiding-center variables \\((\\mathbf{X},u,\\mu,\\zeta)\\). The relation between the physical location \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and the guiding-center position \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is \\[\n\\mathbf{x} \\equiv \\mathbf{X} + \\pmb{\\rho}\n\\tag{26.32}\\] where \\(\\pmb{\\rho}\\) denotes the gyroradius displacement vector in the frame drifting with \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\). Here we simply note that the displacement vector \\(\\pmb{\\rho}\\equiv \\tilde{\\pmb{\\rho}} + \\bar{\\pmb{\\rho}}\\) has a part (denoted by tilde) that is explicitly gyrophase dependent and a part (denoted by bar) that is gyrophase independent. In what follows, we show that the latter part \\[\n\\bar{\\pmb{\\rho}} = \\frac{\\hat{b}}{\\Omega}\\times\\mathbf{v}_E = \\frac{c\\mathbf{E}_\\perp}{\\Omega B}\n\\tag{26.33}\\] denotes the guiding-center polarization displacement (Kaufman, Phys. Fluids, 1986). …\nOur guiding-center Lagrangian Equation 26.30 is obtained from an ordering in which the scalar potential \\(\\Phi\\) is one order lower than the particle kinetic energy, unlike previous derivations of the Hamiltonian theory of guiding-center motion. In this ordering, the electric drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_E\\) is of the same order as the perpendicular velocity \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), as in some non-Hamiltonian calculations (Northrop (1963)). As we will see, this ordering allows us to obtain the polarization drift in the same order as the curvature and \\(\\nabla B\\) drifts, although it appears differently in the theory. However, for consistency the parallel electric field \\(E_\\parallel = \\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\hat{b}\\) must be smaller by one order than the perpendicular field \\(\\mathbf{E}_\\perp\\) (Equation 26.21).\nThe variables \\((J,\\zeta)\\) appear in canonical form in the symplectic part of the guiding-center Lagrangian Equation 26.30 as \\(J\\dot{\\zeta}\\) while the guiding-center Hamiltonian \\(H_\\text{gc}\\) depends on \\(J\\) (or \\(\\mu\\)) alone. The Hamilton equations for \\((J,\\zeta)\\) are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{J} &= -\\frac{\\partial H_\\text{gc}}{\\partial \\zeta} \\equiv 0 \\\\\n\\dot{\\zeta} &= \\frac{\\partial H_\\text{gc}}{\\partial J} \\equiv \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.34}\\]\nEquation 26.34 shows that the gyroaction (or magnetic moment) is conserved by the guiding-center equations of motion. This also follows from Noether’s theorem since the gyrophase \\(\\zeta\\) is an ignorable coordinate, i.e., only its time derivative appears in the guiding-center Lagrangian Equation 26.30.\nIf one is concerned with only the motion of the guiding center and not the evolution of the gyrophase, the term linear in \\(\\dot{\\zeta}\\) can be dropped from the guiding-center Lagrangian, as it does not affect the equations of motion of the other variables, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(u\\). In the evolution equations for \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(u\\), the adiabatic invariant \\(\\mu\\) (or \\(J\\)) does appear but only as a guiding-center dynamical parameter.\nVariation of the guiding-center Lagrangian Equation 26.30 with respect to the variable \\(u\\) gives the Euler-Lagrange equation \\[\n0 = \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial u} = m\\hat{b}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} - \\frac{\\partial H_\\text{gc}}{\\partial u}\n\\] which yields \\[\nu \\equiv \\hat{b}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\n\\tag{26.35}\\]\nThus, the guiding-center Lagrangian Equation 26.30 dictates that \\(u\\) is the velocity of the guiding center in the direction of the magnetic field at the guiding center.\nLast, we vary the Lagrangian Equation 26.30 with respect to the guiding-center position \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), and obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\dot{u}\\hat{b} =& e\\mathbf{E} - \\mu\\nabla B + \\frac{m}{2}\\nabla |\\mathbf{v}_E|^2 - mu\\frac{\\partial\\hat{b}}{\\partial t} \\\\\n& + \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\times\\left( \\frac{e}{c}\\mathbf{B}+mu\\nabla\\times\\hat{b} \\right) \\\\\n\\equiv& e\\left( \\mathbf{E}^\\ast + \\frac{1}{c}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\times\\mathbf{B}^\\ast \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.36}\\] where the effective EM fields \\[\n\\mathbf{E}^\\ast \\equiv -\\nabla\\Phi^\\ast - \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}^\\ast}{\\partial t}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mathbf{B}^\\ast \\equiv\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}^\\ast\n\\tag{26.37}\\] are defined in terms of the effective EM potentials \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ne\\Phi^\\ast &\\equiv e\\Phi + \\mu B -\\frac{m}{2}|\\mathbf{v}_E|^2 \\\\\n\\mathbf{A}^\\ast &\\equiv \\mathbf{A} + \\frac{mc}{e}u\\hat{b}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.38}\\]\nThe guiding-center canonical momentum is now simply expressed as \\(e\\mathbf{A}^\\ast /c\\) and the guiding-center Hamiltonian is \\(e\\Phi^\\ast + mu^2/2\\).\nWe obtain the rate of change of the variable \\(u\\) by taking the scalar product of Equation 26.36 with the effective magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}^\\ast\\) \\[\n\\dot{u} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{B}^\\ast}{m B_\\parallel^\\ast}\\cdot\\left( \\nabla H_\\text{gc} + \\frac{e}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}^\\ast}{\\partial t} \\right) \\equiv \\frac{e}{m}\\frac{\\mathbf{B}^\\ast}{B_\\parallel^\\ast}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}^\\ast\n\\tag{26.39}\\] with \\(B_\\parallel^\\ast = \\hat{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}^\\ast\\) the effective magnetic field in the parallel direction.\nThe time derivative Equation 26.39 contains terms that are higher order (in gyroradius) compared with the dominant terms, which are all that is usually kept. These higher-order terms, however, are needed for energy conservation.\nThe guiding-center velocity \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\) comes from the vector product of Equation 26.36 with \\(\\hat{b}\\) which, using Equation 26.35, yields \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} &= \\frac{\\mathbf{B}^\\ast}{m B_\\parallel^\\ast}\\frac{\\partial H_\\text{gc}}{\\partial u} + \\frac{c\\hat{b}}{eB_\\parallel^\\ast}\\times\\left( \\nabla H_\\text{gc} + \\frac{e}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}^\\ast}{\\partial t} \\right) \\\\\n&= u\\frac{\\mathbf{B}^\\ast}{B_\\parallel^\\ast} + \\mathbf{E}^\\ast\\times\\frac{c\\hat{b}}{B_\\parallel^\\ast}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26.40}\\]\nIf the effective fields Equation 26.37 were replaced by the standard fields \\((\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{B})\\), Equation 26.39 and Equation 26.40 would be the equations of motion for a particle in straight, constant EM fields.\nThe guiding-center equations of motion Equation 26.39 and Equation 26.40 can be used to derive the guiding-center energy equation \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H_\\text{gc}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial H_\\text{gc}}{\\partial t} + \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\nabla H_\\text{gc} + \\dot{u}\\frac{\\partial H_\\text{gc}}{\\partial u} = e\\frac{\\partial\\Phi^\\ast}{\\partial t} -\\frac{e}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}^\\ast}{\\partial t}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\n\\tag{26.41}\\] which implies that the guiding-center energy \\(E_\\text{gc}\\equiv mu^2/2+e\\Phi^\\ast\\) is a constant of the motion for time-independent fields.\nAn important remark must be made here concerning the polarization drift, which is absent from the guiding-center velocity Equation 26.40. This drift, however, is critical for obtaining the dielectric response of a low-frequency plasma. Instead, it appears in the transformation Equation 26.32 itself, i.e., the derivative of this relation gives \\[\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\dot{\\mathbf{X}} + \\dot{\\tilde{\\pmb{\\rho}}} + \\mathbf{v}_\\text{pol}\n\\tag{26.42}\\] with \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_\\text{pol} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{\\pmb{\\rho}}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\tag{26.43}\\] representing the polarization drift, and where \\(\\dot{\\tilde{\\pmb{\\rho}}}=\\dot{\\zeta}\\partial \\tilde{\\pmb{\\rho}}/\\partial \\zeta + ...\\) consists of terms that oscillate on the gyroperiod time scale. The polarization drift is a pure derivative and, hence, can always be integrated. This implies, in particular, that the polarization drift cannot lead to diffusion even in a turbulent field. This is important, as the difference between the guiding center and the average location (found by dropping the second, oscillating term in Equation 26.32) is the polarization, the integral of the polarization drift. This difference must remain small or else the theory, which assumes that the particle remains close to \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), would break down.\nAn alternate set of guiding-center equations of motion may be derived in which the polarization drift appears explicitly in the guiding-center velocity \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\) by choosing \\(\\bar{\\pmb{\\rho}}\\equiv 0\\) instead of Equation 26.33.\n\n\n\n\nCary, John R, and Alain J Brizard. 2009. “Hamiltonian Theory of Guiding-Center Motion.” Reviews of Modern Physics 81 (2): 693. https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.81.693.\n\n\nMignone, Andrea, H Haudemand, and E Puzzoni. 2023. “A Guiding Center Implementation for Relativistic Particle Dynamics in the PLUTO Code.” Computer Physics Communications 285: 108625. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108625.\n\n\nNorthrop, Theodore G. 1963. “Adiabatic Charged-Particle Motion.” Reviews of Geophysics 1 (3): 283–304. https://doi.org/10.1029/RG001i003p00283.\n\n\nNorthrop, Theodore G, and Edward Teller. 1960. “Stability of the Adiabatic Motion of Charged Particles in the Earth’s Field.” Physical Review 117 (1): 215. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.117.215.\n\n\nVandervoort, Peter O. 1960. “The Relativistic Motion of a Charged Particle in an Inhomogeneous Electromagnetic Field.” Annals of Physics 10 (3): 401–53. https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-4916(60)90004-X.",

    "text": "27.1 Quasilinear Theory\nMore than 50 years since its inception, quasi-linear theory (QLT) [Jokipii (1966); Kennel and Engelmann 1966; Hall and Sturrock 1967; Hasselmann and Wibberenz 1970] is still very much the paradigm for phenomenological applications to Galactic cosmic rays. In QLT, the Fokker-Planck equation for the temporal evolution of the phase space density of CRs is derived in a perturbative approach where the force on a particle due to a turbulent magnetic field is evaluated along the unperturbed trajectory in a regular background field. The Fokker-Planck coefficients, most prominently the components of the spatial diffusion tensor, can be computed for a given model of turbulence, parametrised by the two-point function of the turbulent magnetic field. Famously, in QLT the interactions between plasma waves and particles are found to be resonant, meaning that particles of a certain gyroradius \\(r_L = v/\\Omega\\), \\(\\Omega\\) denoting the gyrofrequency, are only affected by waves with a wavenumber k that satisfies \\(k r_L \\mu \\approx 1\\) (for low-frequency waves like Alfvén waves), where \\(\\mu\\) is the cosine of the pitch-angle, that is the angle between the particle momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and the regular magnetic field \\(\\left&lt;\\mathbf{B}\\right&gt;\\), \\(\\mu \\equiv \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\left&lt; \\mathbf{B} \\right&gt; / (|\\mathbf{p}||\\left&lt; \\mathbf{B} \\right&gt;|)\\).\nWhile some of QLT’s predictions are qualitatively confirmed by data, e.g. the rigidity-dependence of the diffusion coefficients, there are a number of concerns. The most famous one is the \\(90^\\circ\\) problem: Due to the resonance condition, particles with pitch-angle close to \\(90^\\circ\\) (\\(\\mu\\approx 0\\)) can only be in resonance with very large wavenumbers k which for the usual turbulent spectra contain little energy. In the limit \\(\\mu\\rightarrow 0\\), the scattering rate vanishes and particles cannot change direction along the background field resulting in ballistic transport. This is obviously at variance with the diffusive transport inferred from observations.\nThe root cause of the \\(90^\\circ\\) problem is the assumption of unperturbed trajectories in QLT. This is remedied in non-linear theories, where the decay of correlations leads to a broadening of the resonance condition which allows for efficient enough scattering through \\(90^\\circ\\). However, any such extension of QLT requires additional assumptions, for instance on the form of temporal decorrelation of the particle’s trajectory.\nThe success and popularity of QLT can be ascribed to its conceptual simplicity and validity in a number of important environments, including the solar wind, the interstellar medium and galaxy clusters. In addition, QLT is simple in principle and thus allows for a straight-forward computation of the transport parameters, albeit it can become arbitrarily complex in practice. Finally, these results can be found to agree with inferences from observations, e.g. the normalisation and power law shape of the Galactic diffusion coefficient.",

    "text": "27.1.1 Derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation\nFor self-consistency, I will repeat all the equations here instead of linking to other parts of the note. Philipp Mertsch uses CGS unit in the following equations.\nCharged particles in electric and magnetic fields \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are subject to the Lorentz force, \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_L = e\\left( \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}/c \\right)\n\\tag{27.1}\\]\nIt is customary to decompose the magnetic field into a large-scale, homogeneous, regular background field, \\(\\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle\\) and a small-scale, turbulent, random field \\(\\delta\\mathbf{B}\\), that is \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\langle\\mathbf{B}\\rangle\\) with \\(\\langle\\delta\\mathbf{B}\\rangle = 0\\). The angled brackets denote averages over an ensemble of turbulent magnetic fields.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume in the following that the regular field is oriented along the z-direction, \\(\\langle\\mathbf{B}\\rangle = B_z\\hat{z}\\), unless stated otherwise. Large-scale electric fields are usually ignored, \\(\\langle\\mathbf{E}\\rangle = 0\\), as the large mobility of charges in astrophysical plasmas is efficiently shielding against regular electric fields (that is on scales much larger than the Debye length). Small-scale electric fields \\(\\delta\\mathbf{E}\\) are necessarily present, but from Faraday’s induction law, their magnitude can be estimated to be \\(|\\delta\\mathbf{E}| \\sim ( v_{\\text{A}} / c) |\\delta\\mathbf{B}|\\) with \\(v_\\text{A}\\) the Alfvén velocity and \\(v_A/c \\ll 1\\) in most astrophysical environments.1 Thus, to lowest order in \\((v_\\text{A}/c)\\), there is no electric field and as the magnetic force is not performing any work on the particle, particle energy is consequently conserved. Note that at higher orders in \\((v_\\text{A}/c)\\), the particle energy can change in a second-order Fermi type process. For simplicity, we constrain ourselves here to considering the lowest order case which results in pitch-angle scattering.\nA charged particle in a magnetic field forms a Hamiltonian system as long as dissipative processes (or any form of energy losses) can be ignored. A consequence of this is Liouville’s theorem, that is the conservation of phase space volume under canonical transformations. As time evolution is a canonical transformation, phases space volume is conserved in time. Together with particle number conservation this implies the conservation of phase space density \\(f = f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{p},t)\\). This is conveniently captured by what we will call Liouville’s equation, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{r}} f + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{p}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} f = 0\n\\tag{27.2}\\] encoding the incompressibility of the phase space flow. Here, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v},\\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{p}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = e\\left( \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{c} \\right)\n\\tag{27.3}\\] are the equations of motion. Note that a necessary condition for a Hamiltonian system is that the forces are conservative and differentiable (“p-divergence-free”, see more in (Bellan 2008)).\nA collisionless plasma under the influence of external \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) fields is an example of a Hamiltonian system. Its Hamiltonian is (Jackson 1998) \\[\nH = \\sqrt{(c\\mathbf{P} - e\\mathbf{A})^2 + m^2c^4} + e\\phi\n\\tag{27.4}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{p} + (e/c)\\mathbf{A}\\) is the canonical momentum, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) the potential vector, m the particle mass, e its charge and \\(\\phi\\) the electric potential. Therefore, the phase space density of this collisionless plasma satisfies Equation 27.2 and substituting the Lorentz force, Equation 27.1, in Equation 27.2 gives the Vlasov equation, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{r}} f + e \\left ( \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{c} \\right ) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} f = 0\n\\tag{27.5}\\] which together with Maxwell’s equations forms the basis of plasma kinetic theory. For a collisional plasma, a term needs to be added to the right-hand side, the famous collision operator. For a collisionless plasma (as appropriate for CRs) the right-hand side remains zero.\nConsidering turbulent fields, the phase space density also becomes a random field, \\(f = \\langle f\\rangle + \\delta f\\), with an expectation value, \\(\\langle f \\rangle\\), and fluctuations around it, \\(\\delta f\\), that satisfy \\(\\langle \\delta f \\rangle=0\\).\nIn any realistic astrophysical situation, it is of course impossible to know the small-scale turbulent field at all positions in order to exactly solve Equation 27.5. Instead, one can only hope to predict statistical moments of the phase space density for a statistical ensemble of turbulent magnetic fields. Traditionally, one is mostly interested in the first moment, the ensemble average, while higher order moments is also possible to obtain.\nFor the reason explained above, we will ignore \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) in the following. Averaging Equation 27.5 we find (Jokipii 1972) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\langle f \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d} t} &= \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{r}} \\langle f \\rangle + e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\langle \\mathbf {B} \\rangle}{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\langle f \\rangle \\\\\n&= - \\left \\langle e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\cdot \\nabla _{\\mathbf{p}} \\delta f \\right \\rangle \\neq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.6}\\]\nNote that unlike the phase space density \\(f\\), the ensemble averaged phase space density \\(\\langle f \\rangle\\) is not conserved, \\(\\mathrm{d}\\langle f\\rangle /\\mathrm{d}t \\neq 0\\). (More on this later!)\nOne way to glean some physical insight from Equation 27.6 is to identify its right-hand-side with a damping term, (Earl+ 1988; Webb 1989), \\[\n\\left \\langle e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} \\delta f \\right \\rangle \\to \\nu \\left( \\langle f \\rangle - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int\\mathrm{d}\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\, \\langle f \\rangle \\right)\n\\] (where \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}=\\mathbf{p}/|\\mathbf{p}|\\)), that is driving the phase space density towards isotropy at a rate \\(\\nu\\), an approach that can also be motivated by gas kinetic theory (Bhatnagar+ 1954). This way, Equation 27.6 can be solved and shown to lead to a spatial diffusion equation. The parallel diffusion coefficient can be identified as \\(\\kappa_\\parallel = v^2 / (3\\nu)\\) whereas the perpendicular diffusion coefficient satisfies \\(\\kappa_\\perp / \\kappa_\\parallel = (1 + \\Omega^2 / \\nu^2)^{-1}\\), a result referred to as the classical scattering limit (Gleeson 1969). Here, \\(\\Omega\\) is the particle’s gyrofrequency.\nIn QLT, however, a more systematic solution for \\(f\\) is sought through an equation for the temporal evolution of the fluctuations \\(\\delta f\\). Such an equation can be obtained by subtracting the ensemble-averaged Vlasov Equation 27.6 from the original Vlasov Equation 27.5, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\partial \\delta f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{r}} \\delta f + e \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\langle \\mathbf{B}\\rangle}{c}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\delta f \\\\\n& \\simeq -e \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\langle f \\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.7}\\] Here, we have chosen to ignore the difference \\[\ne \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} \\delta f - \\left \\langle e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} \\delta f \\right \\rangle\n\\] which is second order in perturbed quantities, \\(\\delta\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\delta f\\). This assumes, of course, that \\(|\\delta\\mathbf{B}|\\ll |\\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle|\\) and therefore \\(\\delta f \\ll \\langle f \\rangle\\). Equation 27.7 can now be integrated with the method of characteristics, the formal solution being \\[\n\\delta f = \\delta f_{0} - \\int _{t_{0}}^{t} \\mathrm {d} t' \\left[ e \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\langle f \\rangle \\right]_{P(t')}\n\\tag{27.8}\\] Here, \\(\\delta f_{0} \\equiv \\delta f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{p}, t_{0})\\) denotes the phase space density at time \\(t_0\\) and the subscript \\(P(t')\\) indicates that positions and momenta in the square brackets are to be evaluated along the characteristics of Equation 27.7, that is the solutions of the equations of motions, Equation 27.3 with \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) replaced by the regular field \\(\\langle\\mathbf{B}\\rangle\\) only (and again no electric field). These solutions \\(P\\) are commonly referred to as unperturbed orbits or unperturbed trajectories. For the homogeneous regular magnetic field \\(\\langle\\mathbf{B}\\rangle = B_z\\hat{z}\\) assumed here they are of course helices along the z-direction.\nWe can now substitue Equation 27.8 into Equation 27.6, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{r}} \\langle f \\rangle + e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\langle \\mathbf {B} \\rangle}{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\langle f \\rangle \\\\\n&\\simeq \\int _{t_{0}}^{t} \\!\\! \\mathrm {d} t' \\! \\left \\langle e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\! \\times \\! \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\! \\cdot \\! \\nabla _{\\mathbf{p}} \\left [ e \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\! \\times \\! \\mathbf{\\delta B}}{c} \\! \\cdot \\! \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\langle f \\rangle \\right ]_{P(t')} \\right \\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.9}\\] where we have dropped the term \\(\\propto \\delta f_0\\). At this stage, we can already see that the right-hand side will lead to diffusion terms (courtesy of the two momentum derivatives) and that it depends on the turbulent magnetic field’s two-point function, integrated along the unperturbed trajectory \\(P(t')\\). To make further progress, we consider the momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) in spherical coordinates, that is \\(\\mathbf{p} = p\\left( \\sqrt{1-\\mu^2}\\cos\\phi, \\sqrt{1-\\mu^2}\\sin\\phi, \\mu \\right)^T\\) and introduce the correlation lengths \\(l_c\\) and correlation times \\(\\tau_c\\) of the turbulent magnetic field, defined through2 \\[\n\\langle \\delta B^{2} \\rangle l_{\\text{c}} \\equiv \\int _{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm {d} \\Delta r \\, \\langle \\delta B(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta B(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{\\Delta r}) \\rangle\n\\tag{27.10}\\] \\[\n\\langle \\delta B^{2} \\rangle \\tau_{\\text{c}} \\equiv \\int _{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm {d} \\Delta t \\, \\langle \\delta B(t) \\delta B(t+\\Delta t) \\rangle\n\\tag{27.11}\\] Here, \\(\\delta B(t)\\) is short-hand for \\(\\left[\\delta B(\\mathbf{r}) \\right]_{P(t)}\\), that is \\(\\delta B(\\mathbf{r})\\) evaluated along the unperturbed trajectory at time t.\nThe right-hand side of Equation 27.9 is still rather unwieldy and further progress requires a number of assumptions. In addition to\n\nSmallness of perturbations, \\(|\\mathbf{\\delta B}| \\ll |\\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle|\\)\n\nthese are:\n\nGyrotropy: The ensemble-averaged phase space density \\(\\langle f \\rangle\\) does not depend on the azimuthal angle \\(\\phi\\), so \\(\\langle f \\rangle (\\mathbf{r}, p, \\mu, \\phi, t) \\to \\langle f \\rangle (\\mathbf{r}, p, \\mu, t)\\).\nAdiabatic approximation: The phase space density only varies on time-scales much larger than the correlation time of the turbulent magnetic field, \\(\\tau_c\\), \\[\n\\langle f \\rangle \\left / \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial t} \\right . \\gg \\tau _{\\text{c}}\n\\tag{27.12}\\]\nFinite correlation times: The correlation times of the turbulent magnetic field are much larger than the Larmor time, \\(\\tau_c \\gg \\Omega^{-1}\\).\nHomogeneous and stationary turbulence: the statistical moments are invariant under translations in space and time. In natural language, it means that the statistics of turbulence do not depend on when and where to take measurements.\n\nUnder these conditions, the ensemble averaged Vlasov equation ultimately results in a Fokker-Planck type equation (Fokker 1914; Planck 1917), also known as the Kolmogorov forward (Kolmogorov 1931) or as the Smoluchowski equation (Bogoliubov and Krylov 1939), describing diffusion in pitch-angle, \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial t} + v \\mu \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mu } \\left ( D_{\\mu \\mu } \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial \\mu } \\right ) \\, .\n\\tag{27.13}\\]\nFollowing the approach sketched above, the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, \\[\nD_{\\mu \\mu} \\equiv \\frac{\\langle (\\Delta \\mu )^{2} \\rangle }{2 \\Delta t}\n\\tag{27.14}\\] can be expressed in terms of the correlation function of the magnetic field. (HOW???)\nIf we had not decided to ignore any electric field, additional terms would have appeared in the Fokker-Planck Equation 27.13, relating to changes in momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and pitch-angle, with diffusion coefficients \\(D_{\\mu p} = D_{p\\mu}\\) and \\(D_{pp}\\) defined analogously to Equation 27.14.\nWe have furthermore assumed that \\(v_A / v \\ll 1\\) in order for \\(D_{xx}, D_{yy}, D_{xy}\\) and \\(D_{yx}\\) to be negligible. Not doing so, would have resulted in the additional terms \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left (D_{xx} \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial x} + D_{xy} \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial y} \\right ) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left (D_{yx} \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial x} + D_{yy} \\frac{\\partial \\langle f \\rangle }{\\partial y} \\right )\n\\] to be added to the right-hand side of Equation 27.13.\nIn summary, under the influence of a turbulent magnetic field, charged particles are performing a random walk in pitch-angle which in the ensemble average results in diffusion in pitch-angle (cosine).\n\n\n27.1.2 The diffusion approximation\nParticle transport can be conveniently categorised if the mean-square displacement in direction i, \\(\\langle \\Delta x_i^2 \\rangle\\), has a power law dependence,3 \\[\n\\langle \\Delta {r}_{i}^{2} \\rangle \\propto (\\Delta t)^{\\alpha}\n\\tag{27.15}\\] as \\[\n\\begin{array}{r@{\\quad } l}\n\\alpha &lt; 1: & \\text{sub-diffusive,} \\\\\n\\alpha = 1: & \\text{diffusive,} \\\\\n\\alpha &gt; 1:& \\text{super-diffusive, in particular} \\\\\n\\alpha = 2: & \\text{ballistic.}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIt seems clear that transport in any perturbative theory with \\(|\\mathbf{\\delta B}| \\ll |\\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle|\\) must be ballistic at early enough times: Particles just gyrate around \\(\\langle\\mathbf{B}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle \\Delta z^{2} \\rangle = (v \\mu \\Delta t)^{2}\\) while \\(\\langle \\Delta x^{2} \\rangle = \\langle \\Delta y^{2} \\rangle = 0\\) when integrated over full gyroperiods. At late times, that is for \\(t \\gg D_{\\mu\\mu}^{-1}\\), we would expect diffusive behaviour for the transport along the field.\nIn order to formalise this picture, we derive a spatial diffusion equation from the Fokker-Planck Equation 27.13. To this end, we decompose \\(\\langle f\\rangle\\) into an isotropic part, \\(g\\), and an anisotropic part, \\(h\\), \\[\n\\langle f \\rangle (p, \\mu, t) = g(p, t) + h(p, \\mu, t)\n\\] where \\[\ng(p, t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\mathrm{d}\\mu \\langle f \\rangle (p, \\mu, t)\n\\] and \\[\n\\int_{-1}^{1} \\mathrm{d}\\mu\\, h(p, \\mu, t) = 0\n\\]\nIf \\(g\\) varies only slowly with time and position, \\[\ng \\left / \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} \\right . \\gg \\tau_{\\text{sc}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g \\left / \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} \\right . \\gg \\lambda_{\\text{sc}}\n\\] where \\(\\tau_{\\text{sc}} \\sim D_{\\mu \\mu }^{-1}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{sc}} \\sim v \\tau_{\\text{sc}}\\) are the scattering time and mean-free path, respectively, the phase space density will be very isotropic, \\(h\\ll g\\). In this case, we can derive a spatial diffusion equation for the isotropic part \\(g\\) (e.g. Hasselmann and Wibberenz 1970), \\[\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z} \\left( \\kappa_{\\parallel} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} \\right) = 0\n\\tag{27.16}\\] with the parallel diffusion coefficient \\[\n\\kappa_{\\parallel} = \\frac{v^{2}}{8} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mathrm{d} \\mu \\frac{(1- \\ \\mu^{2})^{2}}{D_{\\mu\\mu}}\n\\tag{27.17}\\]\nFurthermore, we would expect the anisotropic part \\(h\\) to be dominated by the dipole anisotropy (???), that is \\(h\\approx h_1\\mu\\) with \\[\nh_{1} = \\frac{3}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mathrm{d} \\mu \\, \\mu \\, h(\\mu) = - \\frac{2}{v} \\kappa_{\\parallel} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}\n\\tag{27.18}\\]\n\n\n27.1.3 Computation of transport coefficients\nSo far, we have not specified the functional form of the Fokker-Planck coefficients, e.g. the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\), and its dependence on the two-point correlation function of turbulence \\(P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k})\\) that emerges in the derivation of the Fokker-Planck Equation 27.13. An alternative to the derivation of Section 27.1.1 is to directly compute the Fokker-Planck coefficients from solutions of the equations of motion. In fact, an arbitrary Fokker-Planck coefficient \\(D_{PQ}\\) can be defined in terms of the mean displacements of the variables in question, P and Q. For instance, the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient can be derived as the \\(t\\to\\infty\\) limit of the running diffusion coefficient, \\[\nd_{\\mu\\mu}(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left \\langle (\\Delta \\mu )^{2} \\right \\rangle\n\\tag{27.19}\\]\nThis is a consequence of the Taylor-Green-Kubo formula (Taylor 1922; Green 1951; Kubo 1957), \\[\nD_{\\mu\\mu} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d} t \\langle \\dot{\\mu}(0) \\dot{\\mu}(t) \\rangle\n\\tag{27.20}\\] where the dots denote derivatives with respect to time. For diffusive transport, Equation 27.14 and Equation 27.19 coincide, of course. Moreover, this allows computing the parallel diffusion coefficient \\(\\kappa_\\parallel\\) without the detour of computing \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\) first and then applying the diffusion approximation, Equation 27.17.\nFrom the equations of motion Equation 27.1, we find (HOW???) \\[\n\\dot{\\mu} = \\frac{e}{c p} \\left( \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right)_{z} = \\frac{1}{r_{\\text{g}} B_z} \\left(v_{x} \\delta B_{x}(\\mathbf{r}) - v_{y} \\delta B_{y}(\\mathbf{r}) \\right)\n\\tag{27.21}\\] and thus \\[\nD_{\\mu\\mu} = \\frac{1}{ B_{z} ^{2} r_{\\text{g}}^{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty }\\mathrm{d} t \\left[ v_{x}(t) v_{x}(0) \\mathcal{P}_{yy}(t) + v_{y}(t) v_{y}(0) \\mathcal{P}_{xx}(t) \\right]\n\\tag{27.22}\\]\nHere, we have defined \\[\n\\mathcal{P}_{ij}(t) \\equiv \\langle \\delta B_{i}(0) \\delta B_{j}(t) \\rangle\n\\tag{27.23}\\] and both the velocities and the magnetic fields are to be evaluated along unperturbed trajectories. Note that the fact that the Fokker-Planck coefficients only depend on the two-point function means that we can constrain ourselves to the Gaussian part of the turbulent magnetic field.\n\n\n27.1.4 Turbulence geometries and spectra\nTo make further progress, we need to specify the turbulence correlation tensor \\(\\mathcal{P}_{ij}\\). In the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation we had to assume that turbulence is homogeneous and stationary (assumption 5). In this case, the field can be represented very economically in Fourier space. To this end, we introduce the Fourier transform pair \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta \\tilde{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{k}, t) &= (2\\pi)^{-3/2} \\int_{-\\infty }^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}^{3} r \\, \\delta B_{j}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\mathrm{e} ^{\\imath \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\\\\n\\delta B_{j}(\\mathbf{x}, t) &= (2\\pi)^{-3/2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}^{3} k \\, \\delta \\tilde{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{k}, t) \\mathrm{e} ^{-\\imath \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.24}\\]\nNote that for the magnetic field to have real values, \\(\\delta B_{j}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta B^{*}_{j}(\\mathbf{r})\\), requires a relation between the Fourier components and their complex conjugates, \\[\n\\delta \\tilde{B}^{*}_{j}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\delta \\tilde{B}_{j}(-\\mathbf{k})\n\\]\nThe homogeneity and stationarity now guarantee that the two-point functions \\(\\langle \\delta B_{i}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\delta B_{j}(\\mathbf{r}', t') \\rangle\\) depend on the positions \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}'\\) and times \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) only through the differences \\(\\Delta \\mathbf{r} \\equiv (\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}')\\) and \\((t-t')\\). It is then easy to see that the two-point function in Fourier space is diagonal, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\langle \\delta \\tilde{B}_{i}(\\mathbf{k}, t) \\delta \\tilde{B}^{*}_{j}(\\mathbf{k}', t') \\rangle \\\\ &= \\! (2 \\pi )^{-3} \\!\\!\\! \\int \\!\\! \\mathrm {d} ^{3} r \\, \\mathrm {e} ^{ \\imath \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\!\\!\\! \\int \\!\\! \\mathrm {d} ^{3} r' \\mathrm {e} ^{-\\imath \\mathbf{k}' \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'} \\!\\! \\langle \\delta B_{i}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\delta B_{j}(\\mathbf{r}'\\!, t') \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\delta ^{(3)} (\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{k}') P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}, t-t')\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the turbulence correlation tensor \\(P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}, \\Delta t)\\) is the Fourier transform of the coordinate space two-point function \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}, \\Delta t) \\equiv & (2 \\pi )^{-3/2} \\int _{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm {d} ^{3} (\\Delta r) \\, \\mathrm {e} ^{\\imath \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{r}} \\\\ & \\times \\langle \\delta B_{i}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\delta B_{j}(\\mathbf{r} - \\Delta \\mathbf{r}\\!, t') \\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.25}\\]\nIt contains all the (statistical) information on the magnetic turbulence that enters into the computation of the Fokker-Planck coefficients:\n\ninformation on the turbulence geometry, for instance whether there is a preferred direction for the propagation of waves;\ninformation on the turbulence spectrum, that is the distribution of energy among different turbulent scales;\ninformation on the time-dependence of the correlations.\n\nOftentimes, it is assumed that \\(P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}, \\Delta t)\\) factorises into a magnetostatic correlation tensor \\(P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) \\equiv P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}, 0)\\) independent of time and a time-dependent dynamical correlation function \\(\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}, \\Delta t)\\), \\[\nP_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}, \\Delta t) = P_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) \\Gamma (\\mathbf{k}, \\Delta t)\n\\tag{27.26}\\]\nIn the magnetostatic approximation, we ignore any time-dependence altogether, so \\[\n\\Gamma \\equiv 1\n\\]\nWhile in reality \\(P_{ij}\\) may be arbitrarily complicated, three turbulence geometries have dominated much of the literature, both in analytical studies of transport coefficients and numerical test particle simulations. These three geometries are conceptually simple and particularly amenable to analytical computations of the components of the diffusion tensor and the other Fokker-Planck coefficients:\n\n3D isotropic turbulence\nslab turbulence\na composition of slab and 2D isotropic turbulence\n\n\n27.1.4.1 3D isotropic turbulence\nFor 3D isotropic turbulence the magnetostatic correlation tensor takes the form (Batchelor 1982) \\[\nP^{\\text{3D}}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = g^{\\text{3D}}(k) \\left( \\delta _{ij} - \\frac{k_{i} k_{j}}{k^{2}} + \\imath \\sigma(k) \\epsilon_{ijm} \\frac{k_{m}}{k} \\right)\n\\tag{27.27}\\]\nThe k-dependent real functions \\(g^{\\text{3D}}(k)\\) and \\(\\sigma(k)\\) allow modelling of the overall spectrum and of a wavenumber-dependent helicity, respectively. Note that for linearly polarised waves \\(\\sigma(k)\\equiv 0\\). The normalization of \\(g^{\\text{3D}}(k)\\) is fixed by requiring \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta B^{2} &\\equiv \\langle \\mathbf{\\delta B}^{2}(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle \\! = \\!\\! \\int \\mathrm {d} ^{3} k \\left ( P^{\\text{3D}}_{xx}(\\mathbf{k}) + P^{\\text{3D}}_{yy}( \\mathbf{k}) + P^{\\text{3D}}_{zz}(\\mathbf{k}) \\right ) \\\\ &= 2 \\int \\mathrm {d} ^{3} k \\, g^{\\text{3D}}(k) = 8 \\pi \\int _{0}^{\\infty } \\mathrm {d} k \\, k^{2} g^{\\text{3D}}(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.28}\\]\n\n\n27.1.4.2 Slab turbulence\nIn slab turbulence, it is assumed that all quantities are independent of the coordinates perpendicular to the background field (x and y) and that the turbulent field has no z-component. Consequently, the wave vectors \\(\\mathbf{k}\\parallel \\hat{z}\\) and if we further demand turbulence to be axisymmetric, the turbulence correlation tensor reads \\[\nP^{\\text{slab}}_{ij}(\\mathbf{k}) = g^{\\text{slab}}(k_{\\parallel }) \\frac{\\delta (k_{\\perp })}{k_{\\perp }} \\left ( \\delta _{ij} + \\imath \\sigma (k_{\\parallel }) \\epsilon _{ijz} \\right )\n\\tag{27.29}\\] for \\(i, j \\in x, y\\) and zero otherwise. In our case \\(k_\\parallel = k_z\\) and \\(k_{\\perp } = \\sqrt{k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2}}\\). Again, \\(\\sigma(k_\\parallel)\\) allows for wavenumber-dependent helicity, but vanishes for linear polarisation. The normalisation is then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta B^{2} &\\equiv \\int \\mathrm{d} ^{3} k \\left( P^{\\text{slab}}_{xx}( \\mathbf{k}) + P^{\\text{slab}}_{yy}(\\mathbf{k}) \\right) \\\\\n&= 4 \\pi \\int _{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d} k_{\\parallel} \\, g^{ \\text{slab}}(k_{\\parallel})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.30}\\]\nWhile slab turbulence might seem rather restrictive a turbulence model, it is quite attractive due to its simplicity. In addition, it could be argued that it is of physical relevance in situations where the turbulence is self-generated by anisotropies in the distribution of CRs (Kulsrud and Pearce 1969; Skilling 1975): It has been shown (e.g. Tademaru 1969) that the modes with wavevectors along the background magnetic field grow fastest.\n\n\n27.1.4.3 Composite (slab + 2D isotropic) turbulence\n\n\n27.1.4.4 Turbulence spectra\nHaving reviewed three simple turbulence geometries, we need to specify the spectral shapes \\(g(k)\\) in order to compute transport coefficients. In cascade models of turbulence, energy is injected on the largest scales in the so-called injection (energy) range. Non-linear interactions transfer energy to smaller scales over the so-called inertial range. At very small scales, the turbulent energy is dissipated in the so-called dissipation range. The scale separating the injection and inertial ranges is called the outer scale of turbulence and the scale separating the inertial and the dissipation range is called the dissipation scale.\nMost studies deal with one of two spectra. The first one is a simple power law with spectral index \\(q\\) and low wavenumber cut-off \\(k_0\\), corresponding to the outer scale \\((2\\pi/k_0)\\), \\[\ng_{\\text{PL}}(k) = \\left \\{ \\textstyle\\begin{array}{l@{\\quad }l} g_{0} (k/k_{0})^{-q} & \\text{for } k \\geq k_{0} \\, , \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{array}\\displaystyle \\right .\n\\]\nThe alternative is a broken power law with a flat spectrum below the wavenumber \\(k_0\\) and a power law slope \\(q\\) above, \\[\ng_{\\text{BPL}}(k) = g_{0} \\left ( 1 + \\left ( \\frac{k}{k_{0}} \\right )^{1/s} \\right )^{-q s} \\, .\n\\] Here, \\(s\\) is parametrising the softness of the break and \\(s\\to 0\\) corresponds to a sharp break. It is assumed that the broken power law form can potentially also capture turbulence in the injection range, that is for \\(k&lt;k_0\\).\n\n\n27.1.4.5 Slab turbulence with broken power law spectrum\nThe result for the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient in slab turbulence and for the broken power law spectrum (Shalchi 2009) is given as an example. \\[\ng^{\\text{slab}}(k_{\\parallel }) = \\frac{C \\left (q, \\frac{1}{2} \\right )}{2 \\pi k_{0}} \\delta B^{2} \\left ( 1 + \\left ( \\frac{k}{k_{0}} \\right )^{2} \\right )^{-q/2} \\, .\n\\tag{27.31}\\]\nThe function \\(C(q, s)\\) is fixed by the normalisation condition, see Equation 27.30, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{C(q, s)} & \\equiv \\frac{4}{k_{0}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm {d} k \\, \\left ( 1 + \\left( \\frac{k}{k_{0}} \\right )^{1/s} \\right)^{-q s} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{k_{0}} \\frac{\\Gamma (s(q-1)) \\Gamma (1+s)}{\\Gamma (q \\, s)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{27.32}\\]\nwhere \\(\\Gamma (\\cdot)\\) denotes the gamma function. We have assumed that \\(q&gt;1\\) in order for the k-integral in Equation 27.32 to converge. For \\(q=1\\), instead, we need to assume a cut-off, that is \\(g^{\\text{slab}} = 0\\) for \\(k_{\\parallel} &gt; k_{\\text{max}}\\).\nSubstituting Equation 27.31 into Equation 27.29 and Equation 27.22, one encounters the resonance function (Schlickeiser 2002) \\[\nR^{\\text{slab}} = \\pi \\delta (k_{\\parallel } \\mu v \\pm \\Omega )\n\\tag{27.33}\\]\nEventually, this simplifies to \\[\nD_{\\mu \\mu } = \\frac{\\pi }{2} C \\! \\left ( \\! q, \\frac{1}{2} \\! \\right ) q k_{0} \\frac{\\delta B^{2}}{B_{z}^{2}} \\frac{(1 - \\mu ^{2}) \\mu ^{q-1} (r_{\\text{L}} k_{0})^{q-2}}{(1 + \\mu ^{2} (r_{\\text{L}} k_{0}))^{q/2}}\n\\tag{27.34}\\]\n\n\n\n27.1.5 Field-line random walk\nThe computation of the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient in Equation 27.20 and Equation 27.22 is based on an evaluation of the turbulent part of the Lorentz force along trajectories around the homogeneous background field. As long as perturbations are small, this gives the dominant contribution to the parallel diffusion coefficient, Equation 27.17.\nFor perpendicular transport, however, there is another important contribution due to the fact that the field line is not perfectly homogeneous. Instead, the large-scale magnetic field evaluated for a particle along a field line changes direction with distance along this field line. Under certain conditions, this movement can be shown to be diffusive, see below. If the movement of the particle due to this effect is included in the computation of the mean-square displacements (or equivalently through the Taylor-Green-Kubo approach), this gives the so-called field-line random walk (FLRW) contribution to perpendicular transport. The contribution without this is oftentimes called the microscopic contribution.\nFor slab turbulence, the microscopic diffusion coefficient vanishes (the transport is in fact sub-diffusive), hence FLRW gives the only contribution. For other turbulence geometries, FLRW can also contribute, but might not be dominating.\nLet’s again assume the regular background field \\(\\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle = B_{z} \\hat{z}\\) to be dominating over the perturbations \\(\\delta\\mathbf{B}\\). The equation determining the field line \\(\\{ x(z), y(z) \\}\\) is \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}z} = \\frac{\\delta B_{x}}{B_{z}} \\, ,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}z} = \\frac{\\delta B_{y}}{B_{z}}\n\\] This can formally be integrated to obtain the mean square displacement in the perpendicular directions, e.g. \\[\n\\langle (\\Delta x)^{2} \\rangle \\! = \\! \\frac{1}{B_{z}^{2}} \\int _{0}^{z} \\!\\! \\! \\mathrm {d} z' \\!\\! \\int _{0}^{z} \\!\\!\\! \\mathrm {d} z'' \\langle \\delta B_{x}(\\mathbf{r}(z')) \\delta B_{x}(\\mathbf{r}(z'')) \\rangle\n\\tag{27.35}\\]\nIn slab turbulence, the integrand only depends on z and it is easy to show that the perpendicular mean-square displacement \\(\\langle (\\Delta r_{\\perp})^{2} \\rangle\\) is ballistic at small z and diffusive for large z, e.g. \\[\n\\langle (\\Delta x)^{2} \\rangle = \\left \\{ \\textstyle\\begin{array}{l@{\\quad } l} z^{2} \\left ( \\delta B_{x} / B_{z} \\right )^{2} & \\text{for } z \\to 0 \\, , \\\\ 2 \\kappa _{\\text{FLRW}} |z| & \\text{for } z \\to \\infty \\, , \\end{array}\\displaystyle \\right .\n\\] with the FLRW diffusion coefficient \\[\n\\kappa _{\\text{FLRW}} = \\frac{2 \\pi ^{2}}{B_{z}^{2}} g^{\\text{slab}}(0)\n\\]\nIn other turbulence geometries, the integrand in Equation 27.35 also depends on x and y, such that an explicit solution is not possible without further assumptions.\nIf particles are assumed to diffuse along field lines, \\(\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle \\propto \\Delta t\\), FLRW leads to subdiffusive perpendicular transport, \\(\\langle (\\Delta r_{\\perp})^{2} \\rangle \\propto \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\), a phenomenon known as compound (sub)diffusion (Jokipii 1966). Compound subdiffusion has been applied to a variety of environments like laboratory plasmas, the heliosphere, near-source transport as well as shock acceleration.\n\n\n27.1.6 Short-comings of QLT\nDespite its popularity, QLT exhibits a number of issues. The most well-known pathology of magnetostatic QLT is its inability to scatter particles through \\(90^\\circ\\). While present in a number of turbulence geometries, it is easiest illustrated in slab turbulence where the dependence of the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\) on the spectrum \\(g^{\\text{slab}}(k)\\) becomes very simple. In fact, inspecting Equation 27.34 we see that \\(D_{\\mu\\mu}\\to 0\\) for \\(\\mu\\to 0\\).\nThe root cause for the \\(90^\\circ\\) problem is the narrow resonance condition in magnetostatic QLT, \\(k_{\\parallel } \\mu \\, r_{\\text{L}} = \\pm 1\\) (Equation 27.33). Particles at finite \\(\\mu\\) are in resonance with waves of finite parallel wavenumber, \\(k_{\\parallel} = \\pm 1 / (\\mu r_{\\text{L}})\\). For \\(\\mu\\to 0\\), however, the resonant parallel wavenumber grows without bounds. With the turbulence spectra being falling power laws, however, there is only little energy at small scales and the pitch-angle scattering rate vanishes. In practice, there is of course no energy at all at scales below the dissipation scale.",

    "text": "27.2 Test Particle Simulation\nIn the absence of a widely accepted extension of quasi-linear theory, wave-particle interactions must also be studied in numerical simulations where the equations of motion are directly solved in a realisation of the turbulent magnetic field. The applications of such test particle simulations of cosmic rays are manifold: testing transport theories, computing parameters like diffusion coefficients or making predictions for phenomena beyond standard diffusion theories, e.g. for cosmic ray small-scale anisotropies.\nIdeally, one would test these non-linear theories beyond QLT by comparing their predictions with data from observations. While this approach is being followed by the heliospheric community, a difficulty remains in that the actual turbulence (if known) turns out to be much more complex than what is routinely assumed in analytical transport theories. Alternatively, transport theories can be tested by comparing their predictions with those from numerical experiments.\nTest particle simulations compute the transport of high-energy charged particles through prescribed EM fields without taking into account the effect of the high-energy particles on the EM fields. To this end, a realisation of the turbulent magnetic field is generated and the equations of motion are solved for test particles, that is the contributions of the CR particles to the EM fields are ignored. Given the trajectories of a large enough number of test particles, one can numerically compute the Fokker-Planck coefficients.\nIn addition to testing transport theories by comparing the analytically computed diffusion coefficients to simulated ones, there are at least two more applications of test particle simulations:\n\nFor sources at distances closer or similar to the scattering mean free path, the diffusive transport theory is not necessarily applicable. An often-cited pathology of computing solutions to the diffusion equation is superluminal propagation speeds. Lately, there has been increased interest in the transition between the ballistic and diffusive phases of transport and test particle simulations allow exploring this transition for given turbulent EM fields.\nAnalytical transport theories usually make predictions only for the ensemble-averaged phase-space density and it is usually assumed that the observed phase-space densities are close to the ensemble average. This has now been called into question, in particular in view of the observation of small-scale anisotropies observed in the arrival directions of TeV-PeV CRs. Test particle simulations naturally simulate CR distributions for individual realisations of the turbulent fields and thus provide direct access to such stochasticity effects.\n\nIt needs to point that if the density in the relativistic particles is high enough, the particles can generate their own waves and induce a modification of the turbulence. This is the scenario when test particles models are no longer valid to describe the physics.\n\n\n\n\nBellan, Paul M. 2008. Fundamentals of Plasma Physics.

    "text": "28.1 Conducting Boundary\nThe general boundary conditions on the EM field at an interface between medium 1 and medium 2 are\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{n}\\cdot (\\mathbf{D}_1 - \\mathbf{D}_2)= \\tau \\\\\n\\hat{n}\\times (\\mathbf{E}_1-\\mathbf{E}_2) =\\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\hat{n}\\cdot(\\mathbf{B}_1 - \\mathbf{B}_2) =0 \\\\\n\\hat{n}\\times (\\mathbf{H}_1-\\mathbf{H}_2) =\\mathbf{ K}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{28.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) is used for the interfacial surface change density (to avoid confusion with the conductivity), and \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is the surface current density. Here, \\(\\hat{n}\\) is a unit vector normal to the interface, directed from medium 2 to medium 1. We have learned from EM that at normal incidence, the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave falls off very rapidly with distance inside the surface of a good conductor. In the limit of perfect conductivity (i.e., \\(\\sigma\\rightarrow\\infty\\)), the wave does not penetrate into the conductor at all, in which case the internal tangential electric and magnetic fields vanish. This implies, from Equation 28.1, that the tangential component of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) vanishes just outside the surface of a good conductor, whereas the tangential component of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) may remain finite. Let us examine the behavior of the normal field components.\nLet medium 1 be a conductor, of conductivity \\(\\sigma\\) and dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon_1\\), for which \\(\\sigma /\\epsilon_1\\,\\epsilon_0\\,\\omega \\gg 1\\) , and let medium 2 be a perfect insulator of dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon_2\\). The change density that forms at the interface between the two media is related to the currents flowing inside the conductor. In fact, the conservation of charge requires that\n\\[\n\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{j} = \\frac{\\partial\\tau}{\\partial t} = -i\\, \\omega\\,\\tau\n\\]\nHowever, \\(\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{j} = \\hat{n}\\cdot\\sigma \\,\\mathbf{E}_1\\), so it follows from Equation 28.1 that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{n}\\cdot(\\epsilon_0\\epsilon_1\\mathbf{E}_1 - \\epsilon_0\\epsilon_1\\mathbf{E}_2) = \\frac{i\\sigma}{\\omega}\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1 \\\\\n\\left(1+ \\frac{i\\,\\omega\\,\\epsilon_0\\,\\epsilon_1}{\\sigma}\\right)\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_1 = \\frac{i\\,\\omega\\, \\epsilon_0\\,\\epsilon_2}{\\sigma}\\,\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, it is clear that the normal component of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) within the conductor also becomes vanishingly small as the conductivity approaches infinity.\nIf \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) vanishes inside a perfect conductor then the curl of \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) also vanishes, and the time rate of change of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is correspondingly zero. This implies that there are no oscillatory fields whatever inside such a conductor, and that the fields just outside satisfy\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}= -\\tau \\\\\n\\hat{n}\\times\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\hat{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0 \\\\\n\\hat{n}\\times\\mathbf{H}= -\\mathbf{K}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\hat{n}\\) is a unit normal at the surface of the conductor pointing into the conductor. Thus, the electric field is normal, and the magnetic field tangential, at the surface of a perfect conductor. For good conductors, these boundary conditions yield excellent representations of the geometrical configurations of the external fields, but they lead to the neglect of some important features of real fields, such as losses in cavities and signal attenuation in waveguides. Here is an estimation related to the skin depth.",

    "text": "28.2 Perfectly Matched Layer\nIn EM field solvers, often we need boundless free-space simulation to prohibit reflecting waves. Back in 1993, a techinque called perfectly matched layer (PML) for the absorption of EM waves was proposed to handle this problem, so that we don’t necessarily need to set boundaries sufficiently far enough from the scatterer when solving interaction problems. With the new medium the theoretical reflection factor of a plane wave striking a vacuum-layer interface is null at any frequency and at any incidence angle, contrary to the previously designed medium with which such a factor is null at normal incidence only. So, the layer surrounding the computational domain can theoretically absorb without reflection any kind of wave travelling towards boundaries, and it can be regarded as a perfectly matched layer. The new medium as the PML medium and the new technique of free-space simulation as the PML technique.\n\n28.2.1 Derivation\nThe theoretical derivation starts in discussing the transverse electric wave propagation. One key concept that confused me was the magnetic conductivity denoted as \\(\\sigma^\\ast\\). Maybe this is just a jargon: permeability is a magnetic analogy to conductivity in electric circuits. Reluctance in a magnetic circuit is inversely proportional to permeability just as electric resistance is inversely proportional to conductivity. The relationships between length and cross-sectional area are also the same. Consequently calling permeability “magnetic conductivity” is a fine way to reinforce the analogy and understand magnetic circuits using an electronic analogy.\nI guess I need to review my EM courses to fully understand the derivations.",

If we are interested in the interplay between the global plasma system and the kinetic processes, it is a natural question to ask how the behavior of the system depends on the ratio \\(d_g∕d_i\\). For example, in Ganymede’s magnetosphere \\(d_g∕d_i \\sim 10\\) and the kinetic effects have non-negligible contributions to the global system. On the other hand, if \\(d_g∕d_i\\) is a very large number, then the kinetic effects will be mostly limited in a small region.1\nFor quasi-neutral plasmas, \\(n_i = n_e \\rightarrow \\rho_i/\\rho_e = m_i/m_e\\), \\(q_i = q_e\\), \\(p_i = p_e\\). The ion scales are \\(\\sqrt{m_i/m_e}\\) times larger than the corresponding electron scales. For a proton-electron plasma, \\(\\sqrt{d_i/d_e} \\approx 43\\). A standard trick to reduce the computational requirement is to artificially reduce the mass ratio to a smaller value (\\(1836 \\ge d_i/d_e \\ge 25\\)). In terms of reconnection, we have found only a relatively weak dependence of the process on the mass ratio. In practice almost all numerical studies, especially in 3-D, use a reduced ion-electron mass ratio.\nTóth et al. (2017) proposed another scaling methods to increase the ion and electron mass-to-charge ratios by a kinetic scaling factor \\(f\\) while keeping the MHD quantities, the mass densities \\(\\rho_e\\) and \\(\\rho_i\\), the pressures \\(p_e\\) and \\(p_i\\), the bulk velocities \\(u_e\\) and \\(u_i\\), the magnetic field B, and the various constants \\(\\epsilon_0, \\mu_0\\), and c unchanged. A nice property of this scaling method is that the characteristic speeds (bulk velocity, thermal velocity, Alfvén speed) are not modified; in other words, this kinetic scaling has no effect on ideal/resistive MHD. A direct implication of this scaling is the solution on the kinetic scales is similar for different values of f, but the spatial and temporal scales are proportional to f.",

In this way it behaves more like a particle cloud.\nThe crucial assumption in the hybrid model is the quasi-neutrality, that is, the electrons move fast enough to cancel any charge-density fluctuations and \\(\\rho=0\\) is always satisfied. By assuming quasi-neutrality, we can\nThe electron density thus can be written by using ion densities \\(n_e \\approx n_i \\equiv \\sum_s q_s n_s /e\\). In addition, the electron bulk velocity may also be eliminated using Ampère’s law \\[\n\\mathbf{J} = \\mu_0^{-1}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}\n\\tag{30.1}\\] and the relation \\[\n\\mathbf{u}_e = \\mathbf{u}_i - \\mathbf{J}/n_e e\n\\tag{30.2}\\]\nThe basic equations used in the conventional PIC hybrid model first has a particle pusher for individual ions \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}_j}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v}_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}_j}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{q_j}{m_j}\\big( \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_j \\times \\mathbf{B} \\big)\n\\] where the subscript \\(j\\) and \\(e\\) indicate the indices for individual ions and the electron fluid and other notations are standard. The lowercase velocities are velocities for each macro-particle.\nAlternatively, if we rely on a Vlasov system, we directly solve for the distribution function \\(f(\\mathbf{r}_s, \\mathbf{v}_s, t)\\) from the Vlasov equation \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_s\\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_s} + \\mathbf{a}_s\\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_s} = 0\n\\] where \\[\n\\mathbf{a}_s = \\frac{q_s}{m_s}(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}_s\\times\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\nThe generalized Ohm’s law is used to determine the time evolution of the electric field, derived from the electron momentum equation assuming \\(m_e \\rightarrow 0\\), \\[\n\\mathbf{E} = - \\mathbf{u}_i \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 n_e e}(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{n_e e}\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e + \\mathbf{R}_{ei}\n\\tag{30.3}\\] where the current in the Hall term has already been replaced by the curvature of B. Note that the density has been written with electron number density, instead of ion density, to avoid the confusion for multiple ion species under the quasi-neutrality condition. The last term \\(\\mathbf{R}_{ei}\\) can either represent collision/physical resistivity, or artificial resistivity/numerical diffusion. For electromagnetic problems, it can include resistive and hyper-resistive terms of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = \\eta \\mathbf{J} + \\eta_H\\nabla^2\\mathbf{J}\n\\] where the resistivity \\(\\eta\\) may be thought of as accounting in a simple way for electron-ion collisions, and the hyper-resistivity \\(\\eta_H\\) may represent an electron viscosity and helps with numerical stability by damping grid-scale oscillations. In addition, \\(\\mathbf{R}_{ei}\\) can also include contributions from explicit friction or other momentum exchange terms in the particle collision models.\nThe magnetic fields evolve according to Faraday’s law \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\nThe Hall term supports Whistler waves, which usually place the strongest limit on the time step in hybrid PIC codes. The Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition for Whistler waves on the time step is typically \\(\\Omega_{ci}\\Delta t &lt; (\\Delta x/ d_i)^2/\\pi\\). Updating the magnetic field including the Hall term turns out to be a stiff problem, thus requires smaller time step sub-cycling in many practical cases. This is most useful when the grid resolution is very fine with \\(\\Delta x\\ll d_i\\).\nFinally, by determining the electron pressure tensor by using an appropriate equation of state, the evolution of the system can be followed in time. For example, let \\(\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e = P_e \\overleftrightarrow{I}\\) where \\(P_e\\) is the isotropic scalar electron pressure. In the simplest form \\[\nP_e = n_e k_B T_e\n\\] where \\(n_e \\approx n_i\\) and \\(T_e=T_i\\). Note however in a plasma electron pressure is usually higher than ion temperature, so this is a very crude assumption. Another commonly used assumption is an adiabatic process \\[\nP_e = n_e^\\gamma k_B T_e = n_0(n/n_0)^\\gamma k_B T_{e0}\n\\] where \\(\\gamma=5/3\\) is the adiabatic index for a monatomic ideal gas.\nFor more complicated systems with gradients in the initial conditions, a separate electron energy evolution equation is required. This takes the form \\[\n\\frac{\\partial P_e}{\\partial t} = -\\gamma \\nabla\\cdot(P_e \\mathbf{u}_e) + (\\gamma-1)\\mathbf{u}_e\\cdot\\nabla P_e + (\\gamma-1)(-\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{Q}_e + H_{ei})\n\\tag{30.4}\\] where the electron bulk velocity is inferred from Equation 30.2, with the current from Equation 30.1. If used in place of a simple equation of state, Equation 30.4 is integrated in time within the same numerical loop as the magnetic field evolution. For many problems, the electron heat flux may be modeled with a heat conductivity \\(\\kappa\\) as \\[\n\\mathbf{Q_e} = -\\kappa \\nabla T_e\n\\] where \\(\\kappa = \\kappa_e + \\kappa_0\\), \\(\\kappa_e\\) is given by a physical model and may depend on the local plasma conditions, and \\(\\kappa_0\\) is a small (\\(\\kappa_0\\sim 0.01 - 0.1 \\kappa_e\\) for models with a physical heat conductivity, or \\(\\kappa_0\\sim 0.01 n_0 d_i V_A\\) for magnetized simulations) constant numerical diffusion coefficient set separately for convenience that helps maintain numerical stability. Models for electron and ion energy exchange may be included through the term \\(H_{ei}\\), which can be captured by adding energy lost in each cell by ions in collisions models back to the local electron fluid cell. (???)\nIt is of course possible to incorporate the full electron pressure tensor effects to handle specially reconnection physics better.\nA more complete review is given by (Winske et al. 2023) for the hybrid-kinetic model assuming massless electrons. The essential problem in all hybrid algorithms is how to calculate the electric field at the next time step.",

There thus appears the whistler mode whose frequency diverges as \\(\\omega \\propto k^2\\). This means that the maximum phase velocity in the system increases rapidly without bound, implying numerical difficulty. The division-by-density issue originates from Equation 30.2 and appears in the Hall and electron pressure gradient terms. Consequently, a pure vacuum region is not allowed to exist in the simulation domain unless some ad hoc technique is used.\nOn the other hand, this can be restated as hybrid simulations with massless charge-neutralizing electrons are unrealistic if whistlers are involved. Either people use full particle models, or try to incoporate finite electron mass into the conventional hybrid model.\nThe finite electron inertia correction is proposed to solve the whistler-mode wave dispersion issue. The conventional way to include a finite electron inertia correction into the hybrid model is to introduce the following so-called generalized electromagnetic field \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{B}}\\), defined as \\[\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{E} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\big( \\frac{c}{\\omega_{pe}^2}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} \\big)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{B}} = \\mathbf{B} + \\nabla\\times\\big( \\frac{c^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B} \\big)\n\\] in which the terms proportional to \\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) represent electron inertia correction.\nFrom the equation of motion for the electron fluid, it may be shown that \\[\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}} = - \\mathbf{V}_i \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{n_i e}(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{n_i e}\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{P}_e - \\frac{m_e}{e}(\\mathbf{V}_e\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{V}_e\n\\] which is similar to the generalized Ohm’s law but now with the last term which also represents the correction. \\(\\mathbf{V}_e\\) is obtain from Equation 30.2.\nGiven the generalized electric field \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}\\), one can advance the generalized magnetic field \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{B}}\\) by using Faraday’s law, which can be easily checked to satisfy \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\widehat{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\times\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\]\nFurther simplifications are commonly adopted; for example, the electric field correction term and electron-scale spatial variation of density are often ignored. In this case, the magnetic field may be recovered by solving the equation \\[\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{B}} = \\big( 1 - \\frac{c^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}\\nabla^2 \\big)\\mathbf{B}\n\\] and \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{E}\\) is assumed. The nice feature with this approach is that the correction can be implemented as a post process to the each integration step of a standard procedure.",

    "text": "30.5 Normalization\nThere are five basic quantities in the hybrid model (length, mass, time, current density, and number density???) and three physical constants (\\(\\mu_0,q,m\\)). If we add temperature, then correspondingly \\(k_B\\) would appear. Usually even though the particle mass is a constant, we treat it as a parameter to represent a proton system or electron system or other particle system. Thus we need three (\\(5-2\\)) independent reference quantities for the normalized units in a hybrid model. For instance, We can take a magnetic field scale \\(B_0\\), number density scale \\(n_0\\), and mass scale \\(m_0\\). The general variable transformation from the original units to normalized units is \\[\n\\chi = \\chi_0\\tilde{\\chi}\n\\] where \\(\\tilde{\\chi}\\) denote the variable in the normalized units and the scale \\(\\chi_0\\) shall be in the original units (e.g. SI).\nTypically we use the inverse of gyrofrequency for the time scale \\[\nt_0 = \\Omega_{c0}^{-1} = \\frac{m_0}{e B_0}\n\\]\nand Alfvén speed for the velocity scale \\[\nv_0 = v_A = \\frac{B_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_0 m_0}}\n\\]\nThen the length scale is taken to be the ion skin-depth, or inertial length \\[\nL_0 = d_i = \\frac{c}{\\Omega_{c0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_0}{\\mu_0 e^2 n_0}}\n\\]\nA common trick we can use to speed up the simulation is to artificially increase the ion mass such that the length scale is increased \\(\\propto \\sqrt{m_0}\\). For example, in many global hybrid Earth magnetosphere models, \\(d_i\\) in the upstream solar wind is artificially increased to \\(0.1\\,\\text{R}_E\\) (by increasing the ion mass), which is 6.8 times the realistic \\(d_i=0.015\\,\\text{R}_E\\) for \\(n_{sw}=6\\,\\text{amu/cc}\\). If our grid resolution is \\(0.05\\,\\text{R}_E\\approx 300\\,\\text{km}\\) (which is common as of 2020s), we will have about 10 points per ion-scale wave, which is enough to resolve the ion-scale kinetics.\nHowever, a consequence of this scaling due to computational limitation must be emphasized. The reference Alfvén speed \\[\nV_{A0} = d_{i0}\\Omega_{i0}\n\\]\nwill also be larger than reality since we artificialy increase \\(d_{i0}\\) but not \\(\\Omega_{i0}\\).\nNote the difference between gyrofrequency and frequency, which differs by a factor of \\(2\\pi\\): \\[\n\\omega = 2\\pi f\n\\]\nI once made a mistake in dealing with a code that uses SI units. You may wonder how come the ion inertial length is defined by speed of light divided by the plasma ion frequency in the unit of \\([\\text{rad}/\\text{s}]\\), and time scale in the unit of \\(\\Omega_i^{-1}\\) which is \\([\\text{s}/\\text{rad}]\\). In practice, we do not include \\(2\\pi\\) in neither of them!\nThe pressure scale can be equivalently derived from the magnetic pressure or dynamic pressure \\[\nP_0 = \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0} = \\rho_0 v_0^2\n\\] Note the drop of the factor of 2 here: it is then kept in the dimensionless equations, e.g. \\(p_B^\\prime = {B^\\prime}^2/2\\).\nThe temperature scale is then \\[\nT_0 = \\frac{p_0}{n_0 k_B} = \\frac{B_0^2}{2\\mu_0 k_B n_0}\n\\]\nNote the factor of 2 appeared in the pressure and temperature scales: this is to make the derivations consistent.

    "text": "30.7 Boundary Conditions\n\n30.7.1 Open Boundary Conditions\nOpen boundary conditions allow plasma and magnetic flux to flow into or out of the simulation domain. Ion particles are absorbed at the open boundaries, and new particles are injected if necessary. The injected particle flux is sampled from a drifting multi-Maxwellian velocity distribution that matches specified densities, velocities, and pressure moments at the boundary.\nThe magnetic field is formally split into two components \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}_0 + \\mathbf{B}_1\\), with a fixed external field \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) and a time-varying component \\(\\mathbf{B}1\\). The external field is a vacuum field (\\(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_0 = 0\\)) generated by a system of currents outside the plasma. Examples are the interplanetary magnetic field and planetary dipole field in a global magnetosphere simulation, or the confinement fields generated by external coils in a magnetic mirror device. The particles are advanced in the total magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), In the field solver, only \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) is advanced in time, and \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) may be dropped when computing the plasma current density in the Hall term from \\(\\mu_0\\mathbf{J}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}_1\\). The advantage of splitting \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in this manner is that for the open boundary conditions, \\(\\mathbf{B}_0\\) is left fixed in the boundary ghost cells. Otherwise, the external field may change over time by diffusing at the boundaries. For the open boundary condition on the time-varying component of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), the field \\(\\mathbf{B}_1\\) in each ghost cell is set equal to the value of its neighbor within the simulation domain.\nThe electric field is handled differently. The electric field in ghost cells along an open boundary is advanced in time along with the electric field within the bulk cells. But when computing the electric field from the Ohm’s law Equation 30.3 in the a ghost cell, it is assumed that there are no gradients in either \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) or the plasma moments (\\(n\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_i\\)) normal to the boundary. The plasma moments, like the magnetic field, within the ghost cell are set equal to their neighboring values. So, for example, an open boundary in the \\(x\\) direction may have pressure gradient fields \\(E_y\\) and \\(E_z\\) from \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) gradients in \\(P_e\\), but there is no pressure gradient-driven component \\(E_x\\). Crucially, for an open \\(x\\) boundary, gradients in \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) (but not \\(x\\)) are retained in the Hall term \\(\\propto(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})\\times\\mathbf{B}\\). This treatment of the electric field at open boundaries significantly enhances numerical stability. Nevertheless, it is often necessary to also include a buffer region several cells wide with an enhanced hyper-resistivity \\(η_H\\) to dissipate residual oscillations.\n\n\n30.7.2 Magnetosphere Inner Boundary Conditions\nInner boundary condition is often the most tricky part in magnetopshere modeling. In Angeo3D [Lin+ 2014], the inner magnetosphere (\\(r&lt;6\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\)) is assumed to be dominated by a cold, incompressible ion fluid, which coexists with particle ions. The number density of the cold ion fluid is assumed to be \\[\nn_f = \\frac{n_\\text{eq}}{r^3}[1-\\tanh(r-6.5)]\n\\] where \\(r\\) is in the unit of \\(\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\), and \\(n_\\text{eq}=1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}\\).\nThe inclusion of the cold ion fluid in the inner magnetosphere simplifies the conditions for the fluid-dominant low-altitude, inner boundary. Ion particles are set to be reflected at the magnetospheric inner boundary (e.g. \\(r=3.5\\,\\text{R}_\\text{E}\\)). This simple reflection of the ion parallel velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_{i\\parallel}\\) means that loss cone effects are omitted. For a particle distribution with an isotropic pitch angle distribution in a dipole field, the particles in a full loss cone are only 0.3% of the total, which is reasonably neglected. \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is assumed to maintain the dipole field values at the inner boundary. The ionospheric conditions (1000 km altitude) are incorporated into the hybrid code, as in global MHD models (Raeder, Walker, and Ashour-Abdalla 1995). See Section 23.2.",

    "text": "31.2 How it Works\nIn plasma ray tracing, the refractive index of the plasma is calculated based on the plasma parameters, such as the density, temperature, and magnetic field, and the ray is then traced through the plasma using the calculated refractive index in the Snell’s law: \\[\nn_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\tag{31.2}\\] where \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the refractive indices of the media on either side of the interface, \\('theta_1\\) is the angle of incidence, and \\('theta_2\\) is the angle of refraction. This allows us to study how waves interact with plasma and how they can be used to probe and manipulate the properties of the plasma.\nThe ray tracing equations in Cartesian coordinates are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial \\mathbf{k}} = -\\frac{\\partial D/\\partial \\mathbf{k}}{\\partial D/\\partial \\omega} = \\mathbf{v}_g \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}} = \\frac{\\partial D/\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial D/\\partial \\omega}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with the dispersion relation \\[\nD(\\omega,\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{r}) = 0\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)\\) is the spatial location, \\(\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y, k_z)\\) is the wave vector, \\(\\omega\\) is the wave frequency, and \\(\\mathbf{v}_g\\) is the group velocity. The geometrical optics approximation is valid in cases where the wave length is much smaller than the system nonuniform length, which is usually well satisfied for high frequency waves such as ECW and LHW, but should be used with caution for low frequency waves such as ICW and AW.\nWritten in a more explicit way, The three first-order differential equations that relate the position of the ray to its direction and the properties of the medium are: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= v_g \\cos(\\theta) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= v_g \\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{v_g}{k} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}k}{\\mathrm{d}z}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the ray and the z-axis.1\nFor more thorough introduction, check out (Tracy et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n\nTracy, Eugene Raymond, Alain Jean Brizard, AS Richardson, and AN Kaufman. 2014.

    "text": "32.2 Wave Tests\n\n32.2.1 Linear wave\nLinearization of Equation 8.49 ends up in a system of equations \\(\\mathbf{W}_t = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{W})\\mathbf{W}_x\\), where \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) is composed of either the primitive variables or conserved variables in 1D, and the subscripts \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) are corresponding partial derivatives. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ideal MHD can be used to set the characteristic wave perturbations. See the details in Appendix A and B from (Stone et al. 2008).\nThe density, velocity, magnetic field, and total energy are all set to constant values initially. These values can be chosen so that the wave speeds are all well separated, and so that (in MHD) the wavevector is at an arbitrary angle to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The precise values chosen for the tests described here are given in the appropriate results section below.\nThe wave is added to as a perturbation to these constant values of the form \\(\\delta \\mathbf{U} = A \\mathbf{R} \\sin(2\\pi x)\\). Here \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) is the vector of conserved variables, \\(A\\) is an amplitude, and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is the right-eigenvector corresponding to the desired wave family. The components of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) for each test are listed in the appropriate results section below. For all the tests shown here, \\(A = 10^{-6}\\).\nThe length of the computational domain is set to be one wavelength. Periodic boundary conditions are used. After the wave has propagated one wavelength, we measure the error in the numerical solution by computing the norm of the vector resulting from summing the absolute value of errors in each variable over the grid,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon &= || \\Delta U || = \\sqrt{\\sum_k (\\Delta U_k)^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\sum_k (\\sum_{i=1}^{N_x} |U_{k,i}^n - U_{k,i}^0| / N_x)^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere, \\(U_{k,i}\\) is the numerical solution for the k-th component of the vector of conserved quantities at grid point \\(i\\) and time level \\(n\\), \\(U_{k,i}^0\\) is the initial numerical solution, and \\(N_x\\) is the number of grid points. Note the initial solution \\(U_{k,i}^0\\) is just the analytic solution which has been discretized to the grid. Since the discretization of the initial condition also introduces error, to measure the error in the integration algorithm it is important to compute errors relative to the initial condition \\(U_{k,i}^0\\) rather than the analytic solution. In 2D (3D), summation over \\(j(k)\\) is required as well.\nTo compare to the results given here, it is important to\n\nUse the same amplitude for the wave\nCompute the errors in exactly the same way\nCompute the errors at exactly the same time\n\nThis is an excellent quantitative test of the accuracy and convergence rate of a numerical algorithm. The only drawback is that it involves only linear amplitude oscillations. Thus, this test is not characteristic of the kind of problem codes are written to solve in the first place (after all, the dynamics of linear waves can be treated analytically). A code which does well on this test may still be very poor at shock-capturing. Still, it is nice to know an algorithm reduces to the correct answer in the linear regime. Moreover, since virtually all schemes are first-order for discontinuities such as shocks, smooth problems like this are the only way to measure the actual convergence rate of higher-order schemes.\nThis test has proved very useful at detecting coding bugs:\n\nThe errors for left- and right-going waves of the same family should be identical.\nIf the errors do not converge, something is wrong somewhere.\nIt is necessary to use double precision and very small wave amplitudes to eliminate round-off error and nonlinear effects.\n\n\n32.2.1.1 1D Adiabatic Hydrodynamics\nGiven Equation 8.49 (with \\(\\mathbf{B}=0\\)), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho &= 1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{u} &= \\mathbf{0} \\\\\np &= 1/\\gamma\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwith \\(\\gamma = 5/3\\).

We use twice as many grid points in the x-direction at every resolution (e.g. our highest resolution is \\(512 \\times 256\\)), thus the grid is rectangular, but each cell is square. The wave propagates along the diagonal of the grid, at an angle \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(0.5) \\approx 26.6\\) degrees with respect to the x-axis. Since the wave does not propagate along the diagonals of the grid cells, we guarantee the x- and y-fluxes are different; that is the problem is truly multi-dimensional.\n\n\n\n32.2.2 3D Adiabatic MHD\nNow we use a 3D grid of size \\(0 \\le x \\le 3\\) and \\(0 \\le y \\le 1.5\\), and \\(0 \\le z \\le 1.5\\). The grid is of size \\(2N\\times N \\times N\\). The wave propogates along the grid diagonal, again guaranteeing a truly multidimensional test. The background state is identical to the 1D test values.\n\n\n32.2.3 Anisotropic MHD\nThis test is taken from (Daldorff et al. 2014). The parallel and perpendicular pressures vary differently in the collisionless plasma even if the unperturbed plasma has isotropic pressure. The isotropic MHD solutions are not valid in models like anisotropic MHD, hybrid, or PIC.\nThe following equations are an exact solution of the anisotropic MHD equations (Equation 8.49 but replace the energy equation with two pressure equations as in Equation 8.14) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho &= \\rho_0\\left[ 1 + \\delta\\sin(kx-\\omega t) \\right] \\\\\nu_x &= V_f \\delta\\sin(kx-\\omega t) \\\\\nu_y &= 0 \\\\\nu_z &= 0 \\\\\np &= p_0\\left[ 1 + \\gamma\\delta\\sin(kx-\\omega t) \\right] \\\\\np_\\parallel &= p_0\\left[ 1 + \\delta\\sin(kx-\\omega t) \\right] \\\\\nB_x &= 0 \\\\\nB_y &= B_0 \\left(1+\\delta\\sin(kx-\\omega t)\\right) \\\\\nB_z &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(p = \\frac{p_\\parallel + 2p_\\perp}{3}\\) and \\[\nV_f = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\sqrt{\\frac{B_0^2 + 2 p_0}{\\rho_0}}\n\\] is the propagation speed of the fast wave moving perpendicular relative to the magnetic field direction. This corresponds to a case where \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) in Section 10.8.4. Note that \\(p\\) and \\(p_\\parallel\\) have different wave amplitudes, i.e. this solution is different from the isotropic (collisional) fast wave. Also note the \\(2p_0\\) (actually \\(2p_\\perp\\)) term instead of the usual \\(\\gamma p\\) term in the phase speed.\nInitially, we set \\(\\rho_0 = 1, p_0 = 4.5\\times 10^{-4}\\) and \\(B_0 = 0.04\\) which results in \\(V_f=0.05\\). The wavelength is set to \\(\\lambda=32\\) so that \\(k=2\\pi/\\lambda\\). The above solution also satisfies the Vlasov-Maxwell equations solved by a kinetic solver if the ion and electron gyro-radii are small relative to the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) and the propagation speed \\(V_\\mathrm{ph}\\) is much less than the speed of light \\(c\\).\n\n\n32.2.4 Circularly polarized Alfvén wave\nThe following relations describe a right-hand polarized Alfvén wave \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho &= 1.0 \\\\\np &= 0.1 \\\\\nv_\\parallel &= 0.0 \\\\\nv_\\perp &= 0.1\\sin(2\\pi x_\\parallel) \\\\\nv_z &= 0.1\\cos(2\\pi x_\\parallel) \\\\\nB_\\parallel &= 1.0 \\\\\nB_\\perp &= 0.1\\sin(2\\pi x_\\parallel) \\\\\nB_z &= 0.1\\cos(2\\pi x_\\parallel)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with \\(\\gamma = 5/3\\) and \\(x_\\parallel = (x \\cos\\alpha + y\\sin\\alpha)\\) where \\(\\alpha\\) is the angle at which the wave propagates with respect to the grid. Here \\(v_\\perp\\) and \\(B_\\perp\\) are the components of velocity and magnetic field (in the x-y plane) perpendicular to the wavevector. They are related to the components stored on the grid \\(B_x\\) and \\(B_y\\) via \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_\\perp &= - B_x\\sin\\alpha + B_y\\cos\\alpha \\\\\nB_\\parallel &= B_x\\cos\\alpha + B_y\\sin\\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBy inverting the system, we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_x &= B_\\parallel\\cos\\alpha - B_\\perp\\sin\\alpha \\\\\nB_y &= B_\\parallel\\sin\\alpha + B_\\perp\\cos\\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nGenerally the velocity and magnetic perturbation amplitudes are related by \\[\n\\frac{v_1}{B_1} = \\frac{V_A}{B_0}\n\\]\nFor 2D the computational domain is of size \\(L_x = 2L_y\\), with \\(N_x = 2N_y\\). Thus, the grid is rectangular, but each cell is square. The wave propagates along the diagonal of the grid, at an angle \\(\\alpha = \\tan^{-1}(0.5) \\approx 26.6\\) degrees with respect to the x-axis. Since the wave does not propagate along the diagonals of the grid cells, we guarantee the x- and y-fluxes are different; that is the problem is truly multi-dimensional.\nThe wave is an exact nonlinear solution to the MHD equations, allowing one to test the algorithm in the nonlinear regime.1 Although nonlinear amplitude Alfvén waves are subject to a parametric instability (Section 17.4) which causes them to decay into magnetosonic waves, the instability should not be present for the circularly polarized Alfvén waves. Since the problem is smooth, it can be used for convergence testing. Running the test with smaller pressure (higher β) and/or larger amplitudes is a good test of how robust is the algorithm.\nSee more in reference and (Tóth 2000).\n\n\n32.2.5 Whistler wave\nThis test involves the propagation of whistler waves taken from (Daldorff et al. 2014). This is an extension of the circularly polarized Alfvén wave with the Hall term. The whistler waves have variations in the transverse components of the magnetic field and the velocity. The longitudinal components, the density and the pressure are not perturbed. The following solution of the Hall MHD equations describes a right-hand polarized whistler wave propagating in the \\(+x\\)-direction: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_y &= -\\delta u\\cos(kx-\\omega t) \\\\\nu_z &= +\\delta u\\sin(kx-\\omega t) \\\\\nB_y &= +\\delta B\\cos(kx-\\omega t) \\\\\nB_z &= -\\delta B\\sin(kx-\\omega t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{32.5}\\] where the wave speed is (Equation 10.25) \\[\nv_\\mathrm{ph} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\frac{W}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{B_x^2}{\\rho} + \\frac{W^2}{4}},\\quad W=\\frac{m}{e}\\frac{kB_x}{\\rho}\n\\]\nNote that the wave speed depends on the wave number \\(k\\). The magnetic and velocity perturbations are related as (This is different from the usual Alfvénicity Equation 18.4??? But it reduces to the Alfvénicity condition if \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=v_A=B_x/\\sqrt{\\rho}\\).) \\[\n\\frac{\\delta u}{\\delta B} = \\frac{B_x}{v_\\mathrm{ph}\\rho}\n\\tag{32.6}\\]\nWe set \\(\\rho=1, u_x=0, B_x = 0.2\\) and \\(p=5.12\\times 10^{-4}\\), and wavelength \\(\\lambda = 32\\). This results in \\(v_\\mathrm{ph}=0.22059\\) that is about 10% faster than the Alfvén speed \\(V_A=0.2\\), so the Hall term is small but not negligible at this wavelength. The amplitude of the transverse magnetic field perturbation is set to \\(\\delta B = 0.01\\) which is 5% of the background field.\nThese parameters are chosen to satisfy\n\n\\(c \\gg v_\\mathrm{ph}\\)\n\\(m_e\\ll m_i\\)\n\\(\\beta\\ll 1\\)\n\\(\\omega\\ll \\Omega_e\\)\n\nsuch that the kinetic dispersion relation reduces to the Hall MHD dispersion relation for the right-hand polarized whistler waves.\n(Tenerani et al. 2023) shows the Alfvénic wave dispersion and damping relations with respect to \\(\\lambda/d_i\\). When we get close to but not necessarily below the ion inertial length (for \\(\\beta\\sim 1\\), \\(d_i\\) and \\(r_{iL}\\) are on the same order), these effects already take place from both Hall MHD and hybrid simulations.\nWhat I observe while doing this low-\\(\\beta\\) test with the hybrid-Vlasov code Vlasiator is that without the Hall term the wave profile will be quickly distorted starting from the trailing edge of the peaks and troughs of all quantities; with the Hall term the wave profile can be maintained much longer, and of course the phase speed is \\(v_W\\) which is faster than \\(v_A\\) as in the ideal MHD case. In Section 8.6.1, we learned that the Hall term in the Ohm’s law can be neglected under two cases, neither of which apply in this test as shown by the comparison of \\(V_A\\) and \\(v_W\\) above. This implies an important fact that in certain parameter spaces the classical Alfvén waves never exist; we may observe Alfvénic fluctuations (i.e. correlations between \\(\\delta\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\delta\\mathbf{B}\\)), but they may belong to whistler waves (R-waves), EMIC waves (L-waves), or KAWs.\n\n\n32.2.6 Light wave\n\n\n32.2.7 Firehose instability\n\n\n32.2.8 Mirror mode instability\n\n\n32.2.9 Langmuir wave\nLangmuir wave is a rapid electrostatic oscillation in plasma driven by Coulomb force. Here we assume cold plasma and immobile ions. From the fluid perspective, the governing equations are given in Equation 10.2: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} &= -n_0\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial t} &= -\\frac{e}{m}E_1 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial x} &= -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0}n_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe third equation can be alternatively written using the electric potential \\(\\phi\\) which is defined via \\(\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi = -\\partial \\phi/\\partial x\\), \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0}n_1\n\\]\nThen the full equations are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} &= -n_0\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial t} &= -\\frac{e}{m}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} &= \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0}n_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLangmuir oscillation can be driven self-consistently if there is a density perturbation in electrons, i.e. local charge imbalance. A classical test is to set the 1D periodic spatial domain between \\([0,2\\pi]\\) with 512 points, and time step \\(\\Delta t = 0.01\\). The initial perturbation density is \\(n_1 = 0.02n_0\\cos(x)\\), where \\(n_0\\) is the uniform background electron density. Temperature is set to 0. Total simulation time is 100.2\nThe electron equation of motion is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= -e E \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= v\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

At late times, the interaction of the blast wave with the CD at the edge of the evacuated bubble in the center produces filaments of dense gas by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. It is important these fingers are sharp and not diffused away. Moreover, for the hydrodynamical problem, the pattern of the fingers should be exactly symmetric top-to-bottom and left-to-right. For the MHD problem, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is suppressed, and no fingers are evident.",

    "text": "32.4 Instability Tests\n\n32.4.1 Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nWe use a square domain, \\(-0.5 \\le x \\le 0.5; -0.5 \\le y \\le 0.5\\). The boundary conditions are periodic everywhere. For \\(|y| &gt; 0.25\\), we set \\(\\rho = 1\\) and \\(u_x = -0.5\\), for \\(|y| \\le 0.25\\), \\(\\rho = 2\\) and \\(u_x = 0.5\\). The pressure is 2.5 everywhere, and \\(\\gamma = 1\\).4, giving a Mach number of about 0.377 in the \\(\\rho=2\\) gas, and about 0.267 in the \\(\\rho = 1\\) gas. The interface between the two oppositely directed streams is a discontinuity, that is a “slip surface”. We use different densities in the two fluids to make visualization of the interface easier.\nFor the MHD problem, the initial magnetic field is uniform everywhere with \\(B_x = 0.5\\).\nTo seed the instability, we add random numbers to both the x- and y-components of the velocity with peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.01.\nAt early times, one can check that the growth rate of the transverse component of the velocity agrees with the prediction from linear theory. This requires initializing a single-mode perturbation rather than a spectrum of perturbations as we have done here.\nAt late times, once the instability has gone fully nonlinear, it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons. However, the sharpness of the boundary between the two streams is an indication of the numerical diffusion of the scheme. For example, if the HLLE Riemann solver is used, diffusion at the interface is significant enough to suppress the instability.\n\n\n32.4.2 Rayleigh-Taylor instability\nFor the single-mode test, we use a rectangular domain, \\(-0.25 \\le x \\le 0.25; -0.75 \\le y \\le 0.75\\). The boundary conditions are periodic at \\(|x| = 0.25\\), and reflecting walls at \\(|y| = 0.75\\). For \\(y&gt;0\\) the density is 2.0, while for \\(y \\le 0\\) it is 1.0. A constant gravitational acceleration \\(g = 0.1\\) must be added to the equations of motion. The pressure is given by the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, that is \\(p = p_0 - 0.1\\rho y\\), where \\(p_0=2.5\\), and \\(\\gamma=1.4\\). This gives a sound speed of 3.5 in the low density medium at the interface.\nThe structures which appear in the nonlinear regime are very sensitive to the nature of the perturbations used to seed the instability. To avoid gridding errors associated with perturbing the interface, we instead perturb the velocities. For the single-mode perturbation, we set \\(u_y = 0.01[1 + \\cos(4\\pi x)][1 + \\cos(3\\pi y)]/4\\).\nFor the multimode perturbation, we use a domain of size \\(-0.25 \\le x \\le 0.25; -0.375 \\le y \\le 0.375\\), and set \\(u_y = A[1 + \\cos(8\\pi y/3)]/2\\), where \\(A\\) is a random number at each zone with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.01.\nThe way in which source terms are included in the algorithm can have a strong effect on the outcome of this test. For example, for Godunov schemes, if the source term is added using operator splitting, grid noise generated by the lack of an exact numerical equilibrium can perturb the interface and seed structure. If the source terms are included directly in the reconstruction and integration steps, it is able to hold hydrostatic equilibrium automatically.\nAt early times, one can check that the growth rate of the vertical component of the velocity agrees with the prediction from linear theory.\nAt late times, once the instability has gone fully nonlinear, it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons. However, the sharpness of the boundary between the two fluids is an indication of the numerical diffusion of the scheme. Also, the amount of fine scale struture induced by secondary KH instabilities is sensitive to the way the interface is perturbed, and how sharp the algorithm preserves the contact discontinuity. It is not always clear that sharper is better, however. For example the “contact steepener” in the PPM algorithm can introduce “stair stepping” in contact discontinuities in multidimensions, which in turn can cause KH rolls to be seeded by grid noise.",

    "text": "32.6 Reconnection Tests\n\n32.6.1 GEM challenge\nThis 2D setup is based on (Birn et al. 2001). The computation is carried out in a rectangular domain \\(-L_x/2 \\le x\\le L_x/2\\) and \\(-L_z/2\\le z \\le L_z/2\\). The system is taken to be periodic in the x direction with ideal conducting boundaries at \\(z=\\pm L_z/2\\). Thus the boundary conditions on the magnetic fields at the z boundaries are \\(B_z=\\partial B_x/\\partial z = \\partial B_y/\\partial z = 0\\) with corresponding conditions on the electric fields and particle or fluid quantities. Open boundary conditions are used for all quantities.\nThe equilibrium chosen for the reconnection challenge problem is a Harris equilibrium with a floor in the density outside of the current layer. The magnetic field is given by \\[\nB_x(z) = B_0 \\tanh(z/\\lambda)\n\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is the current sheet scale size, and the density by \\[\nn(z) = n_0 \\text{sech}^2(z/\\lambda) + n_\\infty\n\\]\nThe electron and ion temperatures, \\(T_e\\) and \\(T_i\\), are taken to be uniform in the initial state. We assume the plasma \\(\\beta = (p_i+p_e)/p_B=1\\) initially.\nThe normalization of the space and time scales of the system is chosen to be the ion inertial length \\(d_i=c/\\omega_{pi}\\) and the ion cyclotron frequency \\(\\Omega_i^{-1}\\), where \\(\\omega_{pi}^2 = n_0e^2/\\epsilon_0 m_i\\) is evaluated with the density \\(n_0\\) and the ion gyrofrequency \\(\\Omega_i = eB_0/m_i\\) is evaluated at the peak magnetic field. The velocities are then normalized to the Alfvén speed \\(v_A\\). In the normalized units, \\(B_0 = 1\\) and \\(n_0 = 1\\). Specific parameters for the simulations are \\(L_x = 25.6, L_z = 12.8, \\lambda=0.5, n_\\infty/n_0 = 0.2\\), and \\(T_e/T_i = 0.2\\). \\(m_i/m_e = 25\\) is assumed if required.\nThe initial magnetic island is specified through the perturbation in the magnetic flux, \\[\n\\psi(x,z) = \\psi_0 \\cos(2\\pi x/L_x)\\cos(\\pi z/L_z)\n\\] where the magnetic perturbation is given by \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\hat{y}\\times\\nabla\\psi\\), or more specifically, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_{1x} &= -\\psi_0\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{L_z}\\Big)\\cos(2\\pi x/L_x)\\sin(\\pi z/L_z) \\\\\nB_{1z} &= \\psi_0\\Big(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_x}\\Big)\\sin(2\\pi x/L_x)\\cos(\\pi z/L_z)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn normalized units \\(\\psi_0 = 0.1\\), which produces an initial island width which is comparable to the initial width of the current layer. The rationale for such a large initial perturbation is to put the system in the nonlinear regime of magnetic reconnection from the beginning of the simulation.\nThe initial setup is shown in Figure 32.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32.1: Initial density and magnetic field in the GEM current sheet setup.\n\n\n\n\n32.6.1.1 Why do we need to resolve ion inertial length\nPhysically, electrons and ions separate at the scale of ion inertial length. Numerically, Hall term is important only when cell size is small enough to resolve the ion initial length. The reason is as follows. The Ohm’s law is\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -(\\mathbf{U}+\\mathbf{U}_H)\\times\\mathbf{H}\n\\]\nAssume the typical flow velocity is Alfvén velocity: \\(\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{V}_A\\). The Hall velocity is estimated as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{U}_H = -\\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{ne} = -\\frac{\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0ne} \\sim -\\frac{|dB|}{\\mu_0ne\\Delta x} \\sim -\\frac{|B|}{\\mu_0ne\\Delta x}\n\\]\nThe approximation \\(dB\\approx B\\) is valid for relatively coarse grid size; for fine discrete cell sizes, this approximation does not hold, so magnetic field cannot cancel out in the following estimation. Let us now assume we can make this assumption. Then the ratio of Hall velocity and Alfvén velocity is:\n\\[\n\\frac{|\\mathbf{U}_H|}{|\\mathbf{V}_A|} = \\frac{c/\\omega_{pi}}{\\mu_0 \\Delta x}\n\\]\nIon inertial length is also important for PIC: if particle’s velocity is assumed to be Alfvén velocity, then ion inertial length is the same as ion gyroradius.\n\n\n\n32.6.2 Current sheet\nThe grid is a square with \\(-0.5 \\le x \\le 0.5\\) and \\(-0.5 \\le y \\le 0.5\\). The density and pressure are uniform everywhere, with \\(\\rho = 1\\) and \\(p = \\beta/2\\) where \\(\\beta\\) is an input parameter. For \\(|x| &gt; 0.25\\) we set \\(B_y / \\sqrt{4π} = 1\\), otherwise \\(B_y / \\sqrt{4π} = -1\\). The velocities are \\(u_x = A \\sin(2\\pi y)\\) (where \\(A\\) is an amplitude) and \\(u_y = 0\\). The “standard” test uses \\(\\beta = 0.1\\) and \\(A = 0.1\\), although part of the point of this test is to see how small (large) a value of \\(\\beta (A)\\) is required to break the code.\nAlthough we do not know the analytic solution for this problem, it may be an excellent test of the robustness of the algorithm. For ideal MHD, initially the solution should be nonlinearly (???) polarized Alfvén waves propagating along the field in the y-direction (which quickly generate magnetosonic waves since the magnetic pressure does not remain constant). However, because of the two current sheets in the problem (at \\(x = \\pm0.25\\)), reconnection inevitably occurs. Because \\(\\beta &lt; 1\\), this reconnection drives strong over-pressurized regions that launch magnetosonic waves transverse to the field. Moreover, as reconnection changes the topology of the field lines, magnetic islands will form, grow, and merge. The point of the test is to make sure the algorithm can follow this evolution for as long as possible without crashing. Keeping \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0\\) as the field toplogy undergoes complex changes could be important.",

    "text": "33.2 Phenomena\nWhen a current flows within a conductor, whether it be straight or in the form of a coil, a magnetic field builds up around it and this affects the way in which the current builds up after the circuit is made.\nIn terms of how inductance affects and electrical circuit, it helps to look at the way the circuit operates, first for a direct current (DC), and then for an alternating current (AC). Although they follow the same laws and the same effects result, it helps the explanation, the direct current example is simpler, and then this explanation can be used as the basis for the alternating current case.\n\n33.2.1 Direct current\nAs the circuit is made the current starts to flow. As the current increases to its steady value the magnetic field it produces builds up to its final shape. As this occurs, the magnetic field is changing, so this induces a voltage back into the coil itself, as would be expected according to Lenz’s Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33.1: An inductor in a circuit with battery and resistor.\n\n\n\nThe time constant \\(T\\) in seconds of the circuit which will include the inductor value \\(L\\) Henries and the associated circuit resistance, \\(R\\) Ohms can be calculated as \\(T = L/R\\). \\(T\\) is the time for the current \\(I\\) amps to rise to 0.63 of its final steady state value of V/R. The energy stored in the magnetic field is \\(\\frac{1}{2}L\\,I^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33.2: The rise in current when a steady voltage is applied to an inductor.\n\n\n\nWhen the current is switched off this means that effectively the resistance of the circuit rises suddenly to infinity. This means that the ratio \\(L / R\\) becomes very small and the magnetic field falls very rapidly. This represents a large change in magnetic field and accordingly the inductance tries to keep the current flowing and a back electromagnetic force (EMF) is set up to oppose this arising from the energy stored in the magnetic field.\nWhen the back EMF is set up, the very high voltages generated mean that sparks can appear across the switch contact, especially just as the contact is broken. This leads to pitted contacts and wear on any mechanical switches. In electronic circuits this back EMF can destroy semiconductor devices and therefore ways of reducing this back EMF are often employed.\n\n\n33.2.2 Alternating current\nFor the case of the AC passing through an inductor, the same basic principles are used, but as the waveform is repetitive, we tend to look at the way the inductor responds in a slightly different way as it is more convenient.\nBy its very nature, an alternating waveform is changing all of the time. This means that the resulting magnetic field will always be changing, and there will always be an induced back EMF produced. The result of this is that the inductor impedes the flow of the alternating current through it as a result of the inductance. This is in addition to the resistance caused but the Ohmic resistance of the wire.\nIt means that if the Ohmic resistance of the inductor is low, it will pass DC with little loss, but it can present a high impedance to any high frequency signal. This characteristic of an inductor can be used in ensuring that any high frequency signals do not pass though the inductor.\nA further aspect of inductance is that the reactance of an inductor and that of a capacitor can act together in a circuit to cancel each other out. This is known as resonance, and it is widely used in bandpass filters.",

They may also be would on ferromagnetic cores to further increase the level of inductance.\n\n33.3.1 Inductance of Wires and Coils\nStraight wires and coils have an inductance. Normally coils are used for inductors because the linking of the magnetic field between the different turns of the coil increases the inductance and enables the wire to be contained within a smaller volume.\nIf the wire was not coiled, then very long lengths of wire would often be needed making electronic components of this nature not viable. By coiling the wire the inductance is maximised enabling inductors to be incorporated into many electronic circuits.\nHowever, even the inductance of a straight wire can affect some electronic circuits. For most low frequency applications, the inductance of a straight wire can be ignored, but as the frequency increases into the VHF region and beyond, the inductance of the wire itself can become significant, and interconnections need to be kept short to minimise the effects.\nCalculations are available to enable the inductance of wires to be calculated quite accurately, but the inductance of coils is a little more complicated and depends upon a variety of factors including the shape of the coil and the constant of the material in and around the coil.\n\n\n33.3.2 Applications\nInductance is a very important aspect of electronic circuit design. Although inductors are not so widely used in low frequency electronic circuit designs because the size of the electronic components required to give the levels of inductance needed is large, they are widely used for much higher frequencies in radio frequency designs, as well as within EMC — where filtering is used, often using inductors to ensure that any interference is not able to pass along wires and cables. For example a simple form of inductor is often seen on computer cables where a ferrite is added around a cable to add inductance and prevent the signals from travelling along the cable and being transmitted, thereby giving rise to the possibility of interference to other systems.",

    "text": "34.1 What Is a Capacitor?\nA capacitor is a two-terminal electrical device that can store energy in the form of an electric charge. It consists of two electrical conductors that are separated by a distance. The space between the conductors may be filled by vacuum or with an insulating material known as a dielectric. The ability of the capacitor to store charges is known as capacitance.\nCapacitors store energy by holding apart pairs of opposite charges. The simplest design for a capacitor is a parallel plate, which consists of two metal plates with a gap between them. But, different types of capacitors are manufactured in many forms, styles, lengths, girths, and materials.",
