These are my notes about plasma physics from multiple courses and
textbooks, built via \href{https://books.huijzer.xyz}{Books.jl} and is
made possible by the Julia programming language
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bezanson2017julia}{Bezanson et al., 2017}) and
\href{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc}{pandoc}.

Thanks to Prof.~F. F. Chen, Y. Y. Lau, Yi Li, Yuming Wang, Richard
Fitzpatrick, Paul Bellan, and Gábor Tóth through my journey of learning
about plasmas. The backbone of the notes is
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2016introduction}{F. F. Chen, 2016}). I also
learned a lot from Richard Fitzpatrick's online
\href{https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasmahtml}{Plasma
Physics Course Notes}. Y. Y. Lau's graduate course notes also have many
references to (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan,

Definition: Plasma = \emph{ionized gas}

In plasma physics we usually use energy units ``eV'' instead of
temperature. Given Boltzmann constant \(k_B=1.38\times10^{-23}J/K\),

\[
1\text{eV}=(11600\text{K})\times k_B=1.602\times 10^{-19}\text{J} ([V]=[J]/[C])
\]

There are generally two kinds of plasma:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  High temperature(\(>1\text{keV}\)): fusion plasma
\item
  Low temperature(\(\sim 1\text{eV}-100\text{eV}\)): plasma processing,
  space propulsion
\end{enumerate}

At the beginning, it is important to get the idea of size. Starting from
two basic length scales:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(a_0\equiv \text{atomic scale }\)(\(\sim 10^{-10}\text{m}\))
\item
  n = number density (\(\sim 1/\text{cm}^3\) to \(10^{20}/\text{cm}^3\))
\end{itemize}

Physically, \(n\) represents the number of particles in a unit volume,
from which we know \(n^{-1/3}\) has unit of length. It means a typical
length for a single particle. Ionized state implies that
\(k_B T\gg E_i=\) ionization potential
energy\(\sim \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 a_0}\approx 14eV\)).

Gaseous state implies that \(n^{-1/3}\gg a_0\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
n^{-1/3}\gg a_0\sim\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 E_i}\gg \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0(k_B T)} \\
4\pi n^{-1/3} n \Big( \frac{\epsilon_0 k_B T}{e^2 n} \Big) \gg 1 \nonumber
\end{aligned}
\]

\(n^{2/3}\) has unit of \(\text{length}^{-2}\), indicating that the
other term should be in the unit of \(\text{length}^{2}\). This is
derived using dimensional analysis, which gives

\[
\lambda_{D}=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 k_B T}{e^2 n}}\equiv \textrm{Debye length}=740(\text{cm})\sqrt{\frac{T(\text{eV})}{n(\text{cm}^{-3})}}
\]

\[
\begin{split}
(4\pi)^{3/2}n{\lambda_{D}}^3 &\gg 1 \\
n{\lambda_D}^3 &\gg 1 \Rightarrow \text{Large number of particles in a sphere}
\end{split}
\]

This is necessarily satisfied for plasma under previous definitions.

Indication from the definition of plasma:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are large number of particles in a Debye sphere.
\end{enumerate}

\(\underline{\text{Ex}.1}\) laboratory plasma
\(10^{8}\text{cm}^{-3}\rightarrow 10^{20}\text{cm}^{-3}\). Tokamak
\(n=10^{14}\text{cm}^{-3}\), \(k_B T=10\text{keV}=10^4\text{eV}\),
\(n^{-1/3}=2.15\times10^{-5}\text{cm}\),
\(\lambda_D=7.4\times10^{-3}\text{cm} \gg n^{-1/3}\),
\(n{\lambda_{D}}^3\gg 1\).

\(L\gg\lambda_{D}\gg n^{-1/3}\), where \(L\) is the scale of the
physical system (\(\sim 1\text{mm}\text{ to }10\text{m}\)).

Put it in another way, a criterion for an ionized gas to be a plasma is
that it be dense enough that \(\lambda_D\) is much smaller than \(L\).

\(\underline{\text{Ex}.2}\) Interstellar plasma
\(n=1 \text{cm}^{-3}, T=1eV\),
\(\lambda_D=740\text{cm}\sqrt{\frac{1}{1}}=740\text{cm} \gg n^{-1/3}\),
\(n{\lambda_D}^3\gg1\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Particle kinetic energy \(\gg\) average Coulombic interaction energy.
\end{enumerate}

\[
\begin{split}
KE&\sim k_B T \\
PE&\sim \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0(n^{-1/3})}
\end{split}
\]

From the definition we can easily know that

\[
k_B T\gg \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 n^{-1/3}}\Rightarrow KE\gg PE
\]

This implies that particles are hard to be deflected by their
neighbours.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Particles are scattered mostly by accumulative, multiple small angle
  collisions rather than by large angle collisions. This naturally
  follows the above energy discussion, and will be explained in further
  detail later.
\item
  Collective interactions (the basics of all instabilities) dominate
  over Coulombic interactions between individual particles. This has an
  analogy to economy: one has nearly no effect on the whole, but the
  whole has huge effect on individuals. EM fields stand as a bridge
  between particles.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{occurrence-of-plasma-in-nature}{%
\section{Occurrence of Plasma in
Nature}\label{occurrence-of-plasma-in-nature}}

It is now believed that the universe is made of 69\% dark energy, 27\%
dark matter, and 1\% normal matter. All that we can see in the sky is
the part of normal matter that is in the plasma state, emitting
radiation. Plasma in physics, not to be confused with blood plasma, is
an ``ionized'' gas in which at least one of the electrons in an atom has
been stripped free, leaving a positively charged nucleus, called an ion.
Sometimes plasma is called the ``fourth state of matter''. When a solid
is heated, it becomes a liquid. Heating a liquid turns it into a gas.
Upon further heating, the gas is ionized into a plasma. Since a plasma
is made of ions and electrons, which are charged, electric fields are
rampant everywhere, and particles ``collide'' not just when they bump
into one another, but even at a distance where they can feel their
electric fields. Hydrodynamics, which describes the flow of water
through pipes, say, or the flow around boats in yacht races, or the
behavior of airplane wings, is already a complicated subject. Adding the
electric fields of a plasma greatly expands the range of possible
motions, especially in the presence of magnetic fields.

Plasma usually exists only in a vacuum. Otherwise, air will cool the
plasma so that the ions and electrons will recombine into normal neutral
atoms. In the laboratory, we need to pump the air out of a vacuum
chamber. In the vacuum of space, however, much of the gas is in the
plasma state, and we can see it. Stellar interiors and atmospheres,
gaseous nebulas, and entire galaxies can be seen because they are in the
plasma state. On earth, however, our atmosphere limits our experience
with plasmas to a few examples: the flash of a lightning bolt, the soft
glow of the Aurora Borealis, the light of a fluorescent tube, or the
pixels of a plasma TV. We live in a small part of the universe where
plasmas do not occur naturally; otherwise, we would not be alive.

The reason for this can be seen from the Saha equation, which tells us
the amount of ionization to be expected in a gas in thermal equilibrium:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:saha}{}{
\frac{n_i}{n_n}\approx 2.4\times 10^{21}\frac{T^{3/2}}{n_i} e^{-\frac{U_i}{k_B T}}
}\label{eq:saha}\end{equation}

Here \(n_i\) and \(n_n\) are, respectively, the density (number per
\(\text{m}^3\)) of ionized atoms and of neutral atoms, T is the gas
temperature in Kelvin, \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(U_i\) is
the ionization energy of the gas --- that is, the number of joules
required to remove the outermost electron from an atom. For ordinary air
at room temperature, we may take
\(n_n\approx 3\times 10^{25}\,\text{m}^{-3}\),
\(T\approx 300\, \text{K}\), and \(U_i = 14.5\,\text{eV}\) (for
nitrogen), where \(1\,\text{eV} = 1.6\times 10^{19}\,\text{J}\). The
fractional ionization \(n_i/(n_n + n_i) \approx n_i/n_n\) is
ridiculously low:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_n}\approx 10^{-122}
\]

As the temperature is raised, the degree of ionization remains low until
\(U_i\) is only a few times \(k_B T\). Then \(n_i/n_e\) rises abruptly,
and the gas is in a plasma state. Further increase in temperature makes
\(n_n\) less than \(n_i\), and the plasma eventually becomes fully
ionized. This is the reason plasmas exist in astronomical bodies with
temperatures of millions of degrees, but not on the earth. Life could
not easily coexist with a plasma --- at least, plasma of the type we are
talking about. The natural occurrence of plasmas at high temperatures is
the reason for the designation ``the fourth state of matter''.

Although we do not intend to emphasize the Saha equation, we should
point out its physical meaning. Atoms in a gas have a spread of thermal
energies, and an atom is ionized when, by chance, it suffers a collision
of high enough energy to knock out an electron. In a cold gas, such
energetic collisions occur infrequently, since an atom must be
accelerated to much higher than the average energy by a series of
``favorable'' collisions. The exponential factor in
Equation~\ref{eq:saha} expresses the fact that the number of fast atoms
falls exponentially with \(U_i/k_BT\). Once an atom is ionized, it
remains charged until it meets an electron; it then very likely
recombines with the electron to become neutral again. The recombination
rate clearly depends on the density of electrons, which we can take as
equal to \(n_i\). ni. The equilibrium ion fraction, therefore, should
decrease with \(n_i\); and this is the reason for the factor \(ni^{-1}\)
on the right-hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:saha}. The plasma in the
interstellar medium owes its existence to the low value of \(n_i\)
(about 1 per \(\text{cm}^3\)), and hence the low recombination rate.

\hypertarget{definition-of-plasma}{%
\section{Definition of Plasma}\label{definition-of-plasma}}

Any ionized gas cannot be called a plasma, of course; there is always
some small degree of ionization in any gas. A useful definition is as
follows:

\textbf{A plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles
which exhibits collective behavior.}

We must now define ``\emph{quasineutral}'' and ``\emph{collective
behavior}''. The meaning of quasineutrality will be made clear in Sect.
1.4 LINK?. What is meant by ``collective behavior'' is as follows.

Consider the forces acting on a molecule of, say, ordinary air. Since
the molecule is neutral, there is no net electromagnetic force on it,
and the force of gravity is negligible. The molecule moves undisturbed
until it makes a collision with another molecule, and these collisions
control the particle's motion. A macroscopic force applied to a neutral
gas, such as from a loudspeaker generating sound waves, is transmitted
to the individual atoms by collisions. The situation is totally
different in a plasma, which has charged particles. As these charges
move around, they can generate local concentrations of positive or
negative charge, which give rise to electric fields. Motion of charges
also generates currents, and hence magnetic fields. These fields affect
the motion of other charged particles far away.

Let us consider the effect on each other of two slightly charged regions
of plasma separated by a distance \(r\). ADD FIGURE! The Coulomb force
between A and B diminishes as \(1/r^2\). However, for a given solid
angle (that is, \(\Delta r/r =\) constant), the volume of plasma in B
that can affect A increases as \(r^3\). Therefore, elements of plasma
exert a force on one another even at large distances. It is this
long-ranged Coulomb force that gives the plasma a large repertoire of
possible motions and enriches the field of study known as plasma
physics. In fact, the most interesting results concern so-called
``collisionless'' plasmas, in which the long-range electromagnetic
forces are so much larger than the forces due to ordinary local
collisions that the latter can be neglected altogether. By ``collective
behavior'' we mean motions that depend not only on local conditions but
on the state of the plasma in remote regions as well.

The word ``plasma'' seems to be a misnomer. It comes from the Greek
πλάσμα, ατoς, τo, which means something molded or fabricated. Because of
collective behavior, a plasma does not tend to conform to external
influences; rather, it often behaves as if it had a mind of its own.

\hypertarget{concept-of-temperature}{%
\section{Concept of Temperature}\label{concept-of-temperature}}

Before proceeding further, it is important to review and extend our
physical notions of ``temperature''. A gas in thermal equilibrium has
particles of all velocities, and the most probable distribution of these
velocities is known as the Maxwellian distribution. For simplicity,
consider a gas in which the particles can move only in one dimension.
(This is not entirely frivolous; a strong magnetic field, for instance,
can constrain electrons to move only along the field lines.) The
one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution is given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:maxwellian_1d}{}{
f(v) = A \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2}mv^2/k_B T \right)
}\label{eq:maxwellian_1d}\end{equation}

where \(f\mathrm{d}u\) is the number of particles per \(\text{m}^3\)
with velocity between \(u\) and \(u+\mathrm{d}u\), \(\frac{1}{2}mu^2\)
is the kinetic energy, and \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant. The density
\(n\), or number of particles per \(\text{m}^3\), is given by

\[
n = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(v)\mathrm{d}v
\]

The constant \(A\) is related to the density \(n\) by

\[
A = n\left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{1/2}
\]

The width of the distribution is characterized by the constant \(T\),
which we call the temperature. To see the exact meaning of \(T\), we can
compute the average kinetic energy of particles in this distribution:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:average_kinetic_energy}{}{
E_\text{av} = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{2}mv^2f(v)\mathrm{d}v}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(v)\mathrm{d}v}
}\label{eq:average_kinetic_energy}\end{equation}

Defining \(y=v/v_\text{th}\) and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:thermal_speed}{}{
v_\text{th} = \left( 2k_B T/m \right)^{1/2}
}\label{eq:thermal_speed}\end{equation}

we can write Equation~\ref{eq:maxwellian_1d} as

\[
f(v) = A \exp(-v^2/v_\text{th}^2)
\]

and Equation~\ref{eq:average_kinetic_energy} as

\[
E_\text{av} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mA v_\text{th}^3 \int_{-\infty}^\infty [\exp(-y^2)]y^2\mathrm{d}y}{A v_\text{th}\int_{-\infty}^\infty [\exp(-y^2)]\mathrm{d}y}
\]

The integral in the numerator is integrable by parts:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty y\cdot[\exp(-y^2)]y\mathrm{d}y &= \left[ -\frac{1}{2}[\exp(-y^2)]y \right]_{-\infty}^\infty -\int_{-\infty}^\infty -\frac{1}{2}[\exp(-y^2)]\mathrm{d}y \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty [\exp(-y^2)]\mathrm{d}y
\end{aligned}
\]

Canceling the integrals, we have

\[
E_\text{av} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mA v_\text{th}^3\frac{1}{2}}{A v_\text{th}} = \frac{1}{4}m v_\text{th}^2 = \frac{1}{2}k_B T
\]

Thus the average kinetic energy is \(\frac{1}{2}k_B T\).

It is easy to extend this result to three dimensions. Maxwell's
distribution is then

\[
f(v_x, v_y, v_z) = A_3 \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2}m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)/k_B T \right]
\]

where

\[
A_3 = n\left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{3/2}
\]

Because a Maxwellian distribution is isotropic (i.e.~the form is
symmetric in \(v_x,v_y,\) and \(v_z\)), we can separate each dimension.
The average kinetic energy is then 3 times the single dimension result

\[
E_\text{av} = \frac{3}{2}k_B T
\]

The general result is that \(E_\text{av}\) equals \(\frac{1}{2}k_B T\)
per degree of freedom.

Since \(T\) and \(E_\text{av}\) are so closely related, it is customary
in plasma physics to give temperatures in units of energy. To avoid
confusion on the number of dimensions involved, it is not
\(E_\text{av}\) but the energy corresponding to \(k_B T\) that is used
to denote the temperature. For
\(k_B T = 1\,\text{eV}=1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\text{J}\), we have

\[
T = \frac{q}{k_B} = 11600
\]

Thus the conversion factor is

\[
1\,\text{eV} = 11600\,\text{K}
\]

By a 2-eV plasma we mean that \(k_B T=2\,\text{eV}\), or
\(E_\text{av}=3\,\text{eV}\) in three dimensions.

It is interesting that a plasma can have several temperatures at the
same time. It often happens that the ions and the electrons have
separate Maxwellian distributions with different temperatures \(T_i\)
and \(T_e\). This can come about because the collision rate among ions
or among electrons themselves is larger than the rate of collisions
between an ion and an electron. Then each species can be in its own
thermal equilibrium, but the plasma may not last long enough for the two
temperatures to equalize. When there is a magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\),
even a single species, say ions, can have two temperatures. This is
because the forces acting on an ion along \(\mathbf{B}\) are different
from those acting perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\) (due to the Lorentz
force). The components of velocity perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\) and
parallel to \(\mathbf{B}\) may then belong to different Maxwellian
distributions with temperatures \(T_\perp\) and \(T_\parallel\).

Before leaving our review of the notion of temperature, we should dispel
the popular misconception that high temperature necessarily means a lot
of heat. People are usually amazed to learn that the electron
temperature inside a fluorescent light bulb is about
\(20000\, \text{K}\). ``My, it doesn't feel that hot!'' Of course, the
heat capacity must also be taken into account. The density of electrons
inside a fluorescent tube is much less than that of a gas at atmospheric
pressure, and the total amount of heat transferred to the wall by
electrons striking it at their thermal velocities is not that great. For
example, the temperature of a cigarette ash is high enough to cause a
burn, but the total amount of heat involved is not. Many laboratory
plasmas have temperatures of the order of \(1,000,000\,\text{K}\)
(\(100\,\text{eV}\)), but at densities of only \(10^{18}-10^{19}\) per
\(\text{m}^3\), the heating of the walls is not a serious consideration.

\section{Debye Shielding}\label{sec:debye}}

(Problem 4 on P27
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan, 2008}))

A fundamental characteristic of the behavior of plasma is its ability to
shield out electric potentials that are applied to it. Suppose we tried
to put an electric field inside a plasma by inserting two charged balls
connected to a battery (Fig. 1.3 ADD IT!). The balls would attract
particles of the opposite charge, and almost immediately a cloud of ions
would surround the negative ball and a cloud of electrons would surround
the positive ball. (We assume that a layer of dielectric keeps the
plasma from actually recombining on the surface, or that the battery is
large enough to maintain the potential in spite of this.) If the plasma
were cold and there were no thermal motions, there would be just as many
charges in the cloud as in the ball, the shielding would be perfect, and
no electric field would be present in the body of the plasma outside of
the clouds. On the other hand, if the temperature is finite, those
particles that are at the edge of the cloud, where the electric field is
weak, have enough thermal energy to escape from the electrostatic
potential well. The ``edge'' of the cloud then occurs at the radius
where the potential energy is approximately equal to the thermal energy
\(k_BT\) of the particles, and the shielding is not complete. Potentials
of the order of \(k_BT/e\) can leak into the plasma and cause finite
electric fields to exist there.

Let us compute the approximate thickness of such a charge cloud. Let us
put a point charge \(q_T\) into a quasi-neutral gas of charged
particles. The gas is in \emph{local thermodynamic equilibrium} (LTE)
with ion and electron temperatures \(T_e\) and \(T_i\) (They are not
necessarily the same, and in fact, quite different in nature.). (ADD
FIGURE!) We wish to compute \(\phi(x)\). For simplicity, we assume that
the ion-electron mass ratio \(M/m\) is infinite, so that the ions do not
move but form a uniform background of positive charge. To be more
precise, we can say that \(M/m\) is large enough that the inertia of the
ions prevents them from moving significantly on the time scale of the
experiment.

Maxwell distribution:

\[
f(\mathbf{v})=n_0\Big( \frac{m}{2\pi kT}\Big)^{3/2}\exp\Big( -\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\Big)
\]

In the presence of a potential energy \(q\phi\)m the distribution
function follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})=n_0\Big( \frac{m}{2\pi kT}\Big)^{3/2}\exp\Big( -\frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2+q\phi(\mathbf{x})}{kT}\Big)
\]

It would not be worthwhile to prove this here. What this equation says
is intuitively obvious: There are fewer particles at places where the
potential energy is large, since not all particles have enough energy to
get there.

Note that the concept of temperature is valid in LTE. From the Boltzmann
equation,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\nabla_x\cdot(f\mathbf{v})+\nabla_v\cdot(f\mathbf{a})=0 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla_x f+\frac{\mathbf{F}}{m}\cdot\nabla_v f=0
\end{aligned}
\]

If we neglect the time derivatives, we obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:LTE_Vlasov}{}{
(\mathbf{v}_j\cdot\nabla)f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v}_j)+\big[-\frac{1}{m_j}\nabla(q_j\phi)\cdot\nabla_v\big]f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v}_j)=0
}\label{eq:LTE_Vlasov}\end{equation}

The LTE distribution is in a Maxwellian shape,

\[
f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v}_j)=n_j(\mathbf{r})\Big( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\Big)^{3/2}\exp\Big( -\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}\Big)
\]

Substitute into Equation~\ref{eq:LTE_Vlasov}, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
(\mathbf{v}_j\cdot\nabla)n_j +\frac{\mathbf{v}_j\cdot\nabla(q\phi)}{k_BT_j}n_j=0 \\
\Rightarrow n_j(\mathbf{r}) = n_{j0} \exp\Big[ -\frac{q_j\phi_j(\mathbf{r})}{k_BT_j} \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

Then we get the Boltzmann distribution of each species with a separate
temperature for each.

Consider a uniform plasma with \(n_i=n_{i0}e^{-e\phi/k_B T_i}\),
\(n_e=n_{e0}e^{e\phi/k_BT_e}\), and with the quasi-neutral assumption,
\(n_{e0}=n_{i0}=n_0\). Introduce a point charge \(q_T\) in the initially
neutralized plasma. Poisson equation gives

\[
\nabla^2 \phi=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}=-\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\Big[ e(n_e-n_i) +q_T \delta(\mathbf{r})\Big]
\]

Due to symmetry, \(\phi=\phi(r)\). When the temperature is high,
\(q\phi(r)\ll kT\), the exponent is small and we can expand in a Taylor
series and leave only the first order term. In spherical coordinates,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla^2\phi=\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\Big( r^2\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} \Big)& \nonumber \\
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\Big( r^2\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} \Big)+\frac{e}{\epsilon_0}\Big( \underbrace{ n_{e0}e^{e\phi/k_BT_e} - n_{i0}e^{-e\phi/k_B T_i} }_{\approx n_0\big[ e\phi/k_BT_e +e\phi/k_BT_i  \big]}\Big)&= -\frac{q_T}{\epsilon_0}\delta(\mathbf{r}) \\
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\Big( r^2\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} \Big) -\underbrace{\frac{e^2n_0}{\epsilon_0}\Big( \frac{1}{k_B T_e}+\frac{1}{k_BT_i}\Big) }_{ \frac{1}{{\lambda_D}^2}\equiv \frac{1}{{\lambda_{Di}}^2}+\frac{1}{{\lambda_{De}}^2}}\phi&=-\frac{q_T}{\epsilon_0}\delta(\mathbf{r}) \\
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\Big( r^2\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} \Big) -\frac{1}{{\lambda_D}^2}\phi&=-\frac{q_T}{\epsilon_0}\delta(\mathbf{r})
\end{aligned}
\]

where

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:debye_length}{}{
\lambda_D=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 k_BT^\ast}{n_0e^2}}
}\label{eq:debye_length}\end{equation}

is the Debye length,
\(T^\ast=\Big( \frac{1}{T_e}+\frac{1}{T_i} \Big)^{-1}\). The Debye
length, is a measure of the shielding distance or thickness of the
sheath. Note that larger density indicates better shielding effects, as
one would expect, since each layer of plasma contains more electrons.
Furthermore, \(\lambda_D\) increases with increasing \(k_B T^\ast\).
Without thermal agitation, the charge cloud would collapse to an
infinitely thin layer. Finally, most commonly it is the \emph{electron}
temperature (\(T^\ast\approx T_e\)) which is used in the definition of
\(\lambda_D\) because the electrons, being more mobile than the ions,
generally do the shielding by moving so as to create a surplus or
deficit of negative charge. Only in special situations is this not true.

For \(r>0\) (away from the charge),

\[
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\Big( r^2\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} \Big) -\frac{1}{{\lambda_D}^2}\phi=0
\]

Let \(\phi(r)=\frac{F(r)}{r}\), we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2F}{\mathrm{d}r^2}-\frac{F}{{\lambda_D}^2}&=0 \\
\Rightarrow F&=Ae^{-r/\lambda_D}+\cancel{Be^{r/\lambda_D}} (r>0) \nonumber \\
&=Ae^{-r/\lambda_D}
\end{aligned}
\]

Anticipate when \(r\rightarrow 0\),
\(\phi(r)\rightarrow \frac{q_T}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}\approx \frac{A}{r}\).
So

\[
\phi(r)=\frac{q_t}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}e^{-r/\lambda_D}
\]

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:electric_potential}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ElectricPotential.png}
\caption{Electric potential.}\label{fig:electric_potential}
}
\end{figure}

The electric potential drops very quickly
(Figure~\ref{fig:electric_potential}). In other words, if you insert a
charge into a neutral plasma, its potential will only effect within a
small range. Recall the Gauss`s law,

\[
\oint\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}=\frac{Q_T}{\epsilon_0}\rightarrow\textrm{ as }R\rightarrow \infty, \textrm{ E goes to zero.}
\]

The following are useful forms of Equation~\ref{eq:debye_length}:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_D &= 69 (T_e/n)^{1/2}\,\text{m},\quad T_e \text{ in K} \\
\lambda_D &= 7430 (k_B T_e/n)^{1/2}\,\text{m},\quad k_BT_e \text{ in eV}
\end{aligned}
\]

We are now in a position to define ``quasineutrality.'' If the
dimensions \(L\) of a system are much larger than \(\lambda_D\), then
whenever local concentrations of charge arise or external potentials are
introduced into the system, these are shielded out in a distance short
compared with \(L\), leaving the bulk of the plasma free of large
electric potentials or fields. Outside of the sheath on the wall or on
an obstacle, \(\nabla^2\phi\) is very small, and \(n_i\) is equal to
\(n_e\). It takes only a small charge imbalance to give rise to
potentials of the order of \(k_BT/e\). The plasma is ``quasineutral'';
that is, neutral enough so that one can take \(n_i\simeq n_e\simeq n\),
where \(n\) is a common density called the \emph{plasma density}, but
not so neutral that all the interesting electromagnetic forces vanish.
Plasma may be considered neutral over a length scale larger than Debye
length.

\hypertarget{criteria-for-plasmas}{%
\section{Criteria for Plasmas}\label{criteria-for-plasmas}}

We have given two conditions that an ionized gas must satisfy to be
called a plasma. A third condition has to do with collisions. The weakly
ionized gas in an airplane's jet exhaust, for example, does not qualify
as a plasma because the charged particles collide so frequently with
neutral atoms that their motion is controlled by ordinary hydrodynamic
forces rather than by electromagnetic forces. If \(\omega\) is the
frequency of typical plasma oscillations and \(\tau\) is the mean time
between collisions with neutral atoms, we require \(\omega \tau > 1\)
for the gas to behave like a plasma rather than a neutral gas.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\lambda_D \ll L\)
\item
  \(N_D \gg 1\)
\item
  \(\omega\tau > 1\)
\end{enumerate}

Often in lectures people think the condition 1 and 2 are equivalent;
they are NOT exactly. The argument would be that condition 1 is valid
when the distribution is Maxwellian, which happens to be the equilibrium
distribution for large number of particles; condition 2 is the
statistical priori for that to be valid.

\hypertarget{plasma-frequency}{%
\section{Plasma Frequency}\label{plasma-frequency}}

Besides the length scale, we are also interested in time scale. The
plasma frequency,

\[
\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n\,e^2}{\epsilon_0\,m}}
\]

is the most fundamental time-scale in plasma physics. Clearly, there is
a different plasma frequency for each species. However, the relatively
fast electron frequency is, by far, the most important, and references
to ``the plasma frequency'' in most textbooks invariably mean the
electron plasma frequency.

\(\omega_p\) corresponds to the typical electrostatic oscillation
frequency of a given species in response to a small charge separation.
For instance, consider a one-dimensional situation in which a slab
consisting entirely of one charge species is displaced from its
quasi-neutral position by an infinitesimal distance \(\delta x\). The
resulting charge density which develops on the leading face of the slab
is \(\sigma=e\,n\,\delta x\). An equal and opposite charge density
develops on the opposite face. The \(x\)-directed electric field
generated inside the slab is of magnitude
\(E_x= -\sigma/\epsilon_0 =- e\,n\,\delta x/\epsilon_0\). Thus, Newton's
law applied to an individual particle inside the slab yields

\[
m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \delta x}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = e\,E_x = -m\,\omega_p^{~2}\,\delta x
\]

giving \(\delta x = \delta x_0\,\cos\omega_p t\).

Plasma frequency is closely associated with plasma oscillation and
waves. A more thorough derivation is given in
Section~\ref{sec:oscillations}. Note that plasma oscillations will only
be observed if the plasma system is studied over time periods \(\tau\)
longer than the plasma period \(\tau_p\equiv 1/\omega_p\), and if
external actions change the system at a rate no faster than
\(\omega_p\). In the opposite case, one is clearly studying something
other than plasma physics (e.g., nuclear reactions), and the system
cannot not usefully be considered to be a plasma. Likewise, observations
over length-scales \(L\) shorter than the distance \(v_t\,\tau_p\)
traveled by a typical plasma particle during a plasma period will also
not detect plasma behaviour. In this case, particles will exit the
system before completing a plasma oscillation. This distance, which is
the spatial equivalent to \(\tau_p\), is called the \emph{Debye length},
and takes the form

\[
\lambda_D \equiv \sqrt{T/m}\,\,\omega_p^{-1}.
\]

Note that

\[
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0\,T}{n\,e^2}}
\]

is independent of mass, and therefore generally comparable for different
species. Clearly, our idealized system can only usefully be considered
to be a plasma provided that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:length_limit}{}{
\frac{\lambda_D}{L} \ll 1
}\label{eq:length_limit}\end{equation}

and

\[
\frac{\tau_p}{\tau}\ll 1
\]

Here, \(\tau\) and \(L\) represent the typical time-scale and
length-scale of the process under investigation. It should be noted
that, despite the conventional requirement \ref{eq:length_limit}, plasma
physics is capable of considering structures on the Debye scale. The
most important example of this is the Debye sheath: i.e., the boundary
layer which surrounds a plasma confined by a material surface.

\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B}) &= (\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} + (\mathbf{A}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B} + \mathbf\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}) + \mathbf{A}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}) \\

\nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}) &= \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2\mathbf{A}
\end{aligned}
\]

In most cases Einsten notation shall be used to derive all the
identities:

\[
y = \sum_{i=1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3
\]

is simplified by the convention to

\[
y = c_i x^i
\]

The upper indices are not exponents but are indices of coordinates,
coefficients or basis vectors. That is, in this context \(x^2\) should
be understood as the second component of \(x\) rather than the square of
\(x\) (this can occasionally lead to ambiguity). The upper index
position in \(x^i\) is because, typically, an index occurs once in an
upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term.

A basis gives such a form (via the dual basis), hence when working on
\(\mathbf{R}^n\) with a Euclidean metric and a fixed orthonormal basis,
one has the option to work with only subscripts. However, if one changes
coordinates, the way that coefficients change depends on the variance of
the object, and one cannot ignore the distinction. (See this
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation\#Superscripts_and_subscripts_versus_only_subscripts}{wiki

The differential of line segments in a fluid is:

\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{l}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}
}\label{eq:line_diff}\end{equation}

\emph{Proof}. Let the two line segments \(\mathbf{l}_1\) and
\(\mathbf{l}_2\) be expressed as starting point vectors and end point
vectors:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{l}_1&=\mathbf{r}_2 -\mathbf{r}_1 \\
\mathbf{l}_2&=\mathbf{r}_2^\prime -\mathbf{r}_1^\prime

The velocity difference can be written as

\[
\mathbf{v}(x_2,y_2,z_2)-\mathbf{v}(x_1,y_1,z_1) = \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial x}(x_2-x_1) +\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial y}(y_2-y_1) +\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial z}(z_2-z_1) =(\mathbf{l}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v}

So

\[
\mathbf{l}_2=\mathbf{l}_1+\mathbf{l}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}\cdot\Delta t\Rightarrow \frac{\mathbf{l}_2-\mathbf{l}_1}{\Delta t}=\mathbf{l}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}

An idea of \emph{analytic continuation} is introduced here. In practice,
an analytic function is usually defined by means of some mathematical
expression --- such as a polynomial, an infinite series, or an integral.
Ordinarily, there is some region within which the expression is
meaningful and does yield an analytic function. Outside this region, the
expression may cease to be meaningful, and the question then arises as
to whether or not there is any way of extending the definition of the
function so that this ``extended'' function is analytic over a larger
region. A simple example is given as follows.

\emph{Ex.1} Polynomial series

\[
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n
\]

which describes an analytic function for \(|z|<1\) but which diverges
for \(|z|>1\). However, the function

\[
g(z)=\frac{1}{1-z}
\]

is analytic over the whole plane (except at \(z=1\)), and it coincides
with \(f(z)\) inside the unit circle.

Such a function \(g(z)\), which coincides with a given analytic \(f(z)\)
over that region for which \(f(z)\) is defined by which also is analytic
over some extension of that region, is said to be an \emph{analytic
continuation} of \(f(z)\). It is useful to think of \(f(z)\) and
\(g(z)\) as being the same function and to consider that the formula
defining \(f(z)\) failed to provide the values of \(f(z)\) in the
extended region because of some defect in the mode of description rather
than because of some limitation inherent in \(f(z)\) itself. {[}c.f.

\(v\) over the real axis, at \(v=\omega/k\) you will encounter a
singular point. Actually, this integration is convergent if and only if
\(\Im(\omega)>0\). \(-\frac{1}{i\omega}\) is the \emph{analytic
continuation} of \(f(\omega)\) for all complex \(\omega\) except
\(\omega=0\).

To calculate the integral around singular points, we may take advantage
of the Cauchy integral formula and the residual theorem.

\textbf{Theorem 2.1} Cauchy integral

Let \(C_\epsilon\) be a circular arc of radius \(\epsilon\), centered at
\(\alpha\), with subtended angle \(\theta_0\) in counterclockwise
direction. Let \(f(z)\) be an analytic function on \(C_\epsilon+\)inside
\(C_\epsilon\). Then

\[
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0}\int_{c_\epsilon}\frac{f(z)dz}{z-\alpha}=i\theta_0 f(\alpha)
\]

\emph{Proof:} On \(C_\epsilon\), \(z=\alpha+\epsilon e^{i\theta}\),
\(dz=i\epsilon e^{i\theta}\mathrm{d}\theta\).

\[
LHS=\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0}\int_{C_\epsilon}\frac{f(\alpha+\epsilon e^{i\theta})i\epsilon e^{i\theta}\mathrm{d}\theta}{\epsilon e^{i\theta}}=i\theta_0 f(\alpha).
\] □

\textbf{Theorem 2.2} Residue

Let \(f(z)\) be an analytic function on a closed contour \(C+\)inside
\(C\). If point \(\alpha\) is inside \(C\), we have

\[
f(\alpha)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_c \frac{f(z)dz}{z-\alpha}
\]

\emph{Proof}:

\(\frac{f(z)}{z-\alpha}\) is analytic within region bounded by
\(C+L_1-C_\epsilon+L_2\), where \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) are two paths that
connects/breaks \(C\) and \(C_\epsilon\). Therefore

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{C}+\int_{L_1}-\int_{C_\epsilon}+\int_{L_2}\frac{f(z)}{z-\alpha}dz=0 \\
\Rightarrow \oint_{C}\frac{f(z)}{z-\alpha}dz=\oint_{C_\epsilon}\frac{f(z)}{z-\alpha}dz=2\pi i f(\alpha) \textrm{ as }L_1\rightarrow -L_2,\epsilon\rightarrow0 .
\end{aligned}
\] □

There is also a purely algebraic proof available.

Note that the value of \(f(z)\) on \(C\) determines value of
\(f(\alpha)\) for all \(\alpha\) within \(C\). This has a close relation
to the potential theory. Actually, what Cauchy-Riemann condition says
physically is that the potential flow is both irrotational and
incompressible!

\textbf{Theorem 2.3} Residual theorem

Let \(f(z)\) be an analytic function on \(C+\)inside \(C\). If point
\(\alpha\) is inside \(C\), we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:residual_thm}{}{
\oint_c \frac{f(z)dz}{z-\alpha}=2\pi i f(\alpha)\equiv 2\pi i \text{Res}\Big[ \frac{f(z)}{z-x};z=\alpha \Big]
}\label{eq:residual_thm}\end{equation} □

Khan Academy has a \href{https://youtu.be/YWIseo5LwgQ}{nice video} on
this. Applying this powerful theorem, we can calculate many integrals
analytically which contain singular points.

\emph{Ex.3}

\[
f(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv \frac{e^{iv}}{v-\omega}=2\pi ie^{i\omega},\,\Im(\omega)>0
\]

Pick a semi-circle contour \(C_R\) in the upper plane of complex v. Let
\(C\) be a closed contour of a line along the real axis \(\Re(v)\) and
the semi-circle \(C_R\). \(e^{iv}\) is analytic along and inside \(C\),
so

\[
f(\omega)=\Big(\oint_C-\int_{C_R}\Big)\frac{dv e^{iv}}{v-\omega}=2\pi i e^{i\omega}-\int_{C_R}\frac{dv e^{iv}}{v-\omega}=2\pi i e^{i\omega} \textrm{ as } R\rightarrow \infty
\]

\[
\Big( e^{iv}=e^{i(v_r+iv_i)}=e^{iv_r}e^{-v_i},v_i>0 ; v-\omega\rightarrow\infty\Big)
\]

\(2\pi ie^{i\omega}\) is the \emph{analytic continuation} of
\(f(\omega)\) for all \(\omega\). Analytic continuation is achieved if
we deform the contour integration in the complex \(v\) plane.

\emph{Ex.4}

\[
\frac{\epsilon(\omega)}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\chi(\omega)
\]

where

\[
\begin{aligned}
\chi(\omega)&=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv \frac{\partial g/\partial v}{v-\omega/k},\ Im(\omega)>0 \\
&=\int_L dv\frac{\partial g(v)/\partial v}{v-\omega/k}, \textrm{for all complex $\omega$, as long as $L$ lies below $\omega$}
\end{aligned}
\]

Landau integral: pick a trajectory \emph{under} the singular point in
the complex plane to achieve the integration.

FIGURE NEEDED!

Let \(C_\epsilon\) be a small semi-circle under \(\omega/k\). Then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\epsilon(\omega)}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\Big[  P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv\frac{\partial g(v)\partial v}{v-\omega/k}+\int_{C_\epsilon}dv\frac{\partial g(v)\partial v}{v-\omega/k} \Big] \notag \\
&=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\Big[  P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv\frac{\partial g(v)\partial v}{v-\omega/k}+i\pi\frac{\partial g(v)}{\partial v}\big|_{v=\frac{\omega}{k}} \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(P\) denotes the principle value integral. This is the same as
Equation~\ref{eq:landau_residue} that will be discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:landau}.

\hypertarget{helmholtzs-theorem}{%
\section{Helmholtz's Theorem}\label{helmholtzs-theorem}}

Helmholtz's theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem of vector
calculus, states that any sufficiently smooth, rapidly decaying vector
field in three dimensions can be resolved into the sum of an
irrotational (curl-free) vector field and a solenoidal (divergence-free)
vector field.

Let \(\mathbf{F}\) be a vector field on a bounded domain
\(V \subseteq \mathbf{R}^3\), which is twice continuously
differentiable, and let S be the surface that encloses the domain V.
Then \(\mathbf{F}\) can be decomposed into a curl-free component and a
divergence-free component:

\[
\mathbf{F}=\nabla \Phi +\nabla\times\mathbf{A}
\]

where

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(\mathbf{r})&= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\nabla^\prime\cdot\mathbf{F}^\prime(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}dV^\prime -\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_s \widehat{\mathbf{n}}^\prime\cdot\frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}dS^\prime \\
\mathbf{A} &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\nabla^\prime\times \mathbf{F}^\prime(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}dV^\prime -\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_s \widehat{\mathbf{n}}^\prime\times\frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}dS^\prime
\end{aligned}
\]

and \(\nabla^\prime\) is the nabla operator with respect to
\(\mathbf{r}^\prime\), not \(\mathbf{r}\).

If \(V = \mathbf{R}^3\) and is therefore unbounded, and \(\mathbf{F}\)
vanishes faster than \(1/r\) as \(r\rightarrow\infty\), then the second
component of both scalar and vector potential are zero. That is,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(\mathbf{r})&= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\nabla^\prime\cdot\mathbf{F}^\prime(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}dV^\prime  \\
\mathbf{A} &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\nabla^\prime\times \mathbf{F}^\prime(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}dV^\prime
\end{aligned}
\]

\hypertarget{toroidal-and-poloidal-decomposition}{%
\section{Toroidal and Poloidal
Decomposition}\label{toroidal-and-poloidal-decomposition}}

The earliest use of these terms cited by the Oxford English Dictionary
(OED) is by Walter M. Elsasser (1946) in the context of the generation
of the Earth's magnetic field by currents in the core, with ``toroidal''
being parallel to lines of latitude and ``poloidal'' being in the
direction of the magnetic field (i.e.~towards the poles).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:toroidal_poloidal}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/toroidal_poloidal.png}
\caption{Toroidal-Poloidal Decomposition.}\label{fig:toroidal_poloidal}
}
\end{figure}

The OED also records the later usage of these terms in the context of
toroidally confined plasmas, as encountered in magnetic confinement
fusion. In the plasma context, the toroidal direction is the long way
around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by z in the
slab approximation or \(\zeta\) or \(\phi\) in magnetic coordinates; the
poloidal direction is the short way around the torus, the corresponding
coordinate being denoted by y in the slab approximation or \(\theta\) in
magnetic coordinates. (The third direction, normal to the magnetic
surfaces, is often called the ``radial direction'', denoted by x in the
slab approximation and variously \(\psi\), \(\chi\), r, \(\rho\), or
\(s\) in magnetic coordinates.)

In vector calculus, a topic in pure and applied mathematics, a
poloidal--toroidal decomposition is a restricted form of the Helmholtz
decomposition. It is often used in the spherical coordinates analysis of
solenoidal vector fields, for example, magnetic fields and
incompressible fluids.

For a three-dimensional vector field \(\mathbf{F}\) with zero divergence

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}=0
\]

This \(\mathbf{F}\) can be expressed as the sum of a toroidal field
\(\mathbf{T}\) and poloidal vector field \(\mathbf{P}\)

\[
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{T}+\mathbf{P}
\]

where \(\widehat{r}\) is a radial vector in spherical coordinates
\((r,\theta,\phi)\). The toroidal field is obtained from a scalar field,
\(\psi(r,\theta,\phi)\) as the following curl,

\[
\mathbf{T}=\nabla\times(\widehat{r}\Psi(\mathbf{r}))
\]

and the poloidal field is derived from another scalar field
\(\phi(r,\theta,\phi)\) as a twice-iterated curl,

\[
\mathbf{P}=\nabla\times\nabla\times(\widehat{r}\Phi(\mathbf{r}))
\]

This decomposition is symmetric in that the curl of a toroidal field is
poloidal, and the curl of a poloidal field is toroidal. The
poloidal--toroidal decomposition is unique if it is required that the
average of the scalar fields \(\Psi\) and \(\Phi\) vanishes on every
sphere of radius \(r\).

\hypertarget{magnetic-dipole-field}{%
\section{Magnetic Dipole Field}\label{magnetic-dipole-field}}

If there's no current,

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_0 \mathbf{J} = 0 \Rightarrow B=-\nabla V
\]

The divergence free condition for magnetic field then yields a laplace
equation

\[
\Delta V = 0
\]

for the Gauss potential \(V\). The solution of Laplace equation within a
certain volume has been first described by Gauss and reads in complex
notation

\[
V(\mathbf{r},t) = Re \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{l} \Big\{ R_0 \big( \frac{R_0}{r}\big)^{l+1} G_{lm}^\ast(t)Y_{lm}^\ast(\theta,\phi) + R_0\big( \frac{r}{R_0} \big)^{l} C_{lm}^\ast(t)Y_{lm}^\ast(\theta,\phi) \Big\}
\]

where \(R_0\) is a constant coefficient, and the complex internal Gauss
coefficients

\[
G_{lm}^\ast(t) = G_{lm}(t) - i H_{lm}(t)
\]

and external coefficients

\[
C_{lm}^\ast(t) = C_{lm}(t) - iD_{lm}(t)
\]

adopting all time variability as well as the complex spherical harmonics

\[
Y_{lm}^\ast(\theta,\phi) = e^{im\phi}_{lm}(\cos{\theta})
\]

with associated Legendre polynomials \(P_{lm}(\cos{\theta})\).
e.g.~\(P_{00}(\cos\theta) = 1,\ P_{10} = \cos\theta,\ P_{11} = \sin\theta\).

\emph{Ex 1.} Planet dipole field

Let the radius of the planet be \(R\) (the same as the coefficient).
Then the Gauss potential for the dipole reads

\[
V = \frac{R^3}{r^2}\big[ G_{10}\cos\theta + G_{11}\cos\phi\sin\theta + H_{11}\sin\phi\sin\theta \big]
\]

Let dipole moment be \(\mathbf{m} = (G_{11},H_{11},G_{10})\) in
Cartesian coordinates, we have

\[
\mathbf{B} = -\nabla V = -\nabla \Big[ \frac{R^3\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{r}}{r^3} \Big]
\]

This is why in literature we often see dipole moments in the unit of
\([\text{nT}]\): it is equivalent to the equatorial field strength
\(B_{\text{eq}}\) at the planet's surface. If we specify the dipole
moment \(M\) in \([\text{T}\text{m}^3]\), then
\(B_{\text{eq}}=M/R_\text{E}^3\).

When we expand the gradient operator, we have

\[
\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{3(\mathbf{m}\cdot\widehat{r})\widehat{r}-\mathbf{m}}{r^3}
\]

In spherical coordinates \((r,\theta,\varphi)\) aligned with the dipole
moment,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dipole_spherical}{}{
\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{m}{r^3} (-2\cos\theta, -\sin\theta, \,0)
}\label{eq:dipole_spherical}\end{equation}

It is usually convenient to work in terms of the latitude,
\(\vartheta = \pi/2 - \theta\), rather than the polar angle, \(\theta\).
An individual magnetic field-line satisfies the equation

\[
r = r_\mathrm{eq}\,\cos^2\vartheta
\]

where \(r_\mathrm{eq}\) is the radial distance to the field line in the
equatorial plane (\(\vartheta=0^\circ\)). It is conventional to label
field lines using the L-shell parameter, \(L=r_\mathrm{eq}/R_E\). Here,
\(R_E = 6.37\times 10^6\,\mathrm{m}\) is the Earth's radius. Thus, the
variation of the magnetic field-strength along a field line
characterized by a given \(L\)-value is

\[
B = \frac{B_E}{L^3} \frac{(1+3\,\sin^2\vartheta)^{1/2}}{\cos^6\vartheta}
\]

where
\(B_E= \mu_0 M_E/(4\pi\, R_E^{~3}) = 3.11\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{T}\) is
the equatorial magnetic field-strength on the Earth's surface.

In Cartesian representation,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dipole_cartesian}{}{
\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{1}{r^5}
\begin{pmatrix}
(3x^2-r^2) & 3xy & 3xz \\
3yx & (3y^2-r^2) & 3yz \\
3zx & 3zy & (3z^2-r^2)
\end{pmatrix}
\mathbf{m}
}\label{eq:dipole_cartesian}\end{equation}

Note that \((x,y,z)\) and \(r\) are all normalized to the radius of the
planet \(R\).

\hypertarget{greens-function}{%
\section{Green's Function}\label{greens-function}}

The Vlasov theory and the 2-fluid theory only tell us when instability
will happen, but neither tell us the severity of instability. To know
the magnitude of instability mathematically, we can introduce Green's
function

\[
G(x,t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{ikx-i\omega(k) t}dk
\]

where \(t\) is the beam's pulse length and \(x\) is the propagation
distance. At \(t=0\), we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
G(x,0)&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{ikx}dk=\frac{1}{2i\pi x}e^{ikx}\bigg|_{k=-\infty}^{k=\infty} \\
&=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2i\pi x}\big[ \cos{kx}+i\sin{kx}-\cos{kx}+i\sin{kx} \big] \\
&=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\sin{kx}}{x}=\delta(x)
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\delta(x)\) is the \(\delta\)-function.

The integral \(\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sin x}{x}\mathrm{d}x\) is called
the Dirichlet integral. It is a very famous and important generalized
improper integral. Here at least you can see that

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}G(x,0)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin kx}{x}\mathrm{d}x=1\quad \textrm{and}\quad G(0,0)=\infty
\]

\hypertarget{linearization}{%
\section{Linearization}\label{linearization}}

In linear wave analysis, we need to check how small perturbations evolve
in the PDEs. For plasma physics, it is usually very useful to transform
into a magnetic field guided coordinates, with the notation
\(\parallel\) being parallel to the background magnetic field and
\(\perp\) being perpendicular to the background magnetic field
\(\mathbf{B}\). Besides the perturbation of plasma moments
(i.e.~density, velocity, pressure, etc.), we also need the perturbations
to the magnitude of the magnetic field B and the unit vector
\(\hat{\mathbf{b}}\). Linearzing \(B^2 = \mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{B}\), we
find

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perturb_b}{}{
\delta B = \hat{\mathbf{b}}\cdot\delta\mathbf{B} = \delta B_\parallel
}\label{eq:perturb_b}\end{equation}

Linearzing \(\hat{\mathbf{b}} = \mathbf{B}/B\), we obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perturb_bhat}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\delta\hat{\mathbf{b}} = \delta\Big(\frac{\mathbf{B}}{B}\Big) = \frac{\delta\mathbf{B}B - \delta B\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \frac{\delta\mathbf{B}}{B} - \frac{\delta \mathbf{B}_\parallel}{B} = \frac{\delta \mathbf{B}_\perp}{B}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:perturb_bhat}\end{equation}

The divergence-free of magnetic field gives

\[
\mathbf{k}\cdot\delta\mathbf{B} = k_\parallel \delta B_\parallel + k_\perp \delta B_\perp = 0
\]

Thus

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perturb_k_bhat}{}{
\mathbf{k}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{b}} = \mathbf{k}\cdot\frac{\delta \mathbf{B}_\perp}{B} = \frac{k_\perp \delta B_\perp}{B} = -k_\parallel\frac{\delta B_\parallel}{B} = -k_\parallel\frac{\delta B}{B}
}\label{eq:perturb_k_bhat}\end{equation}

These seemingly trivial relations have profound implications in physics.
Equation~\ref{eq:perturb_b} tells us that the perturbation of magnetic
field magnitude has only contribution from the parallel component, which
is why in satellite observations people only look at parallel
perturbations for compressional wave modes.
Equation~\ref{eq:perturb_bhat} tells us that the perturbation in the
unit vector is only related to the perpendicular fluctuations.

\hypertarget{sec:WKB}{%

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ODE_Omode}{}{

}\label{eq:ODE_Omode}\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH):

\[

\]

In general, a second order ODE

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 u(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + a_1(x)\frac{du(x)}{\mathrm{d}x} + a_2(x)u(x) = 0
\]

can be rewritten to get rid of the first derivative. Let

\[
u(x) = E(x) e^{-\frac{1}{2}\int^x a_1(x)\mathrm{d}x}
\]

we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:2nd_ODE}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + k^2(x) E(x) = 0
}\label{eq:2nd_ODE}\end{equation}

where

\[
k^2(x) = a_2(x) - \frac{{a_1}^2}{4} -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mathrm{d} a_1(x)}{\mathrm{d}x}
\]

Note that the lower bound of the integral is left on purpose to account
for a constant. We will concentrate at special points, i.e.~zeros
(cutoff) and poles (resonance) of
\(k^2(x)\equiv \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}n^2(x)\).

First, we will introduce \emph{Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin-Jeffreys}
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WKB_approximation}{WKBJ}) solution
to Equation~\ref{eq:2nd_ODE}:

\[
E(x) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(x)}}e^{\pm i\int^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime}.
\]

\emph{Proof}.

For simplicity, here we use a simple harmonic oscillation analogy.
Consider

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + \Omega^2(t)x(t) = 0
\]

Assume \(\Omega \gg 1\), and \(T\) is the time scale over which
\(\Omega\) changes appreciably. We would anticipate solutions like

\[
\begin{aligned}
&x(t)\sim e^{\pm i \Phi(t)} \\
&\dot{x}(t) \sim \pm i \dot{\Phi}(t) x(t) \\
&\ddot{x}(t) \sim - \dot{\Phi}^2(t) x(t) \cancel{\pm i \ddot{\Phi}(t)x(t)} \\
\Rightarrow &\dot{\Phi}(t) = \Omega(t),\ \text{or } \Phi(t) = \int^t \Omega(t^\prime) \mathrm{d}t^\prime + \text{const.}
\end{aligned}
\]

Write \(x(t) = A(t)\sin{[\Phi(t)]}\), where \(A(t)\) is slowly varying
in time, \(\dot{A}(t)\ll \Omega A\), which is almost a periodic motion.
From adiabatic theory in classical mechanics,
\(\oint pdq \simeq \text{const.}\), we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\oint mv_x \mathrm{d} x \simeq \text{const.} \\
\oint m\dot{x}\dot{x}\mathrm{d}t \simeq \text{const.}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then in a period \(2\pi/\Omega\),

\[
\frac{2\pi}{\Omega}\oint m\dot{x}^2dt =\frac{2\pi}{\Omega}\oint mA^2 \Omega^2\cos^2\Phi \mathrm{d}t \simeq \text{const.}
\]

which leads to

\[
mA^2\Omega \simeq \text{const.},\ A\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}}
\]

Thus the general form of solution can be written as

\[
x(t)\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}}e^{\pm i \Phi(t)} \sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{\pm i \int^t \Omega(t^\prime)\mathrm{d}t^\prime+\text{const.}}
\]

□

Note:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There is no lower limit to the integral, because it is like adding a
  constant.
\item
  This solution is valid if \(k\cdot L > O(3)\), where \(L\) is the
  length scale over which \(k^2(x)\) changes appreciably. (???)Formally
  the condition should be \(kL\gg 1\). Apparently near resonance
  (\(k\rightarrow\infty\)), the condition breaks down, then how do we
  reconcile the solution? There are more discussions coming up and
  applications in Section~\ref{sec:waves} and Section~\ref{sec:flr}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sec:airy}{%
\subsection{Airy Function}\label{sec:airy}}

We want to develop a general method for cut-off and resonance. Away from
the turning point \(x_t\),

\[
E_{\text{WKBJ}}(x) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(x)}}e^{\pm i\int^x k(x)\mathrm{d}x}
\]

Near \(x=x_t\), we can use a linear approximation for \(k^2(x)\) (first
term in the Taylor expansion),

\[
k^2(x) \approx -{k_0}^2 a(x-x_t)
\]

Then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + k^2(x)E &= 0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}x^2} - {k_0}^2 a (x-x_t) E &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(\frac{x-x_t}{l}=\zeta\), we have

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}\zeta^2} - l^2 {k_0}^2 a l \zeta E(\zeta) = 0
\]

If we choose \(l\) s.t. \(l^3 {k_0}^2 a =1\) (non-dimensional
treatment), we obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:stokes}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}\zeta^2} - \zeta E(\zeta) = 0
}\label{eq:stokes}\end{equation}

which is equivalent to the case where \(k^2(\zeta)=-\zeta\) that shows
the linear approximation. Equation~\ref{eq:stokes}, known as the
\emph{Airy equation} or \emph{Stokes equation}, is the simplest
second-order linear differential equation with a turning point (a point
where the character of the solutions changes from oscillatory to
exponential). From the WKBJ theory, we get the solution

\[
E_{\text{WKBJ}} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(x)}}e^{\pm i\int^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime}
= \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
\zeta^{-1/4}e^{\mp\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}} & \text{if } \zeta > 0 \\
(-\zeta)^{-1/4}e^{\pm i \frac{2}{3}(-\zeta)^{3/2}} & \text{if } \zeta < 0
\end{array} \right.
\]

Note that the solution blows up at \(\zeta=0\) (turning point)
miserably. For \(\zeta>0\), one solution is exponentially decay while
the other is exponentially growing; for \(\zeta<0\), the two solutions
are oscillatory. Solutions can also be found as series in ascending
powers of \(\zeta\) by the standard method. Assume that a solution is
\(E=a_0+a_1\zeta+a_2\zeta^2+...\) Substitute this in Stokes Equation and
equate powers of \(\zeta\) will give relations between the constants
\(a_0,a_1,a_2\),etc., and lead finally to

\[
\begin{aligned}
E = &a_0\Big\{ 1+\frac{\zeta^3}{3\cdot2} +\frac{\zeta^6}{6\cdot5\cdot3\cdot2} + \frac{\zeta^9}{9\cdot8\cdot6\cdot5\cdot3\cdot2} + ... \Big\} \\
&+a_1\Big\{ \zeta+\frac{\zeta^4}{4\cdot3} +\frac{\zeta^7}{7\cdot6\cdot4\cdot3} + \frac{\zeta^{10}}{10\cdot9\cdot7\cdot6\cdot4\cdot3} + ...  \Big\}
\end{aligned}
\]

which contains the two arbitrary constants \(a_0\) and \(a_1\), and is
therefore the most general solution. The series are convergent for all
\(\zeta\), which confirms that every solution of Stokes Equation is
finite, continuous and single valued.

This form is usually not easy to interpret in physical sense. Besides
this, we can find a more useful solution to Equation~\ref{eq:stokes}
using the integral representation. An equivalent but maybe more
intuitive approach is to solve Equation~\ref{eq:stokes} with Fourier
transform; a coefficient \(2\pi\) naturally appears. Both approaches
reach the same results.

Write

\[
E(\zeta) = \int_a^b \mathrm{d}t e^{t\zeta} f(t)
\]

where the integral represents a path in the complex t plane from \(a\)
to \(b\). Then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}\zeta^2} &= \int_a^b \mathrm{d}t\ t^2 e^{t\zeta} f(t) \\
\zeta E(\zeta) &= \int_a^b \mathrm{d}t \zeta e^{t\zeta} f(t) = \int_a^b \mathrm{d}t \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(e^{t\zeta}) f(t) \\
&=e^{t\zeta} f(t) \Big|_a^b -\int_a^b dte^{t\zeta} f^\prime(t)
\end{aligned}
\]

The limits \(a,b\) are be chosen so that the first term vanishes at both
limits. Then Equation~\ref{eq:stokes} is satisfied if

\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
e^{t\zeta} f(t) \Big|_a^b  = 0\\
t^2 f(t) = -\frac{\mathrm{d} f(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} \Rightarrow f(t) = Ae^{-\frac{1}{3}t^3}
\end{array} \right.
\]

where \(A\) is a constant. The solution is now written as

\[
E(\zeta) = \int_a^b \mathrm{d}t Ae^{t\zeta-\frac{1}{3}t^3}
\]

The limits \(a\) and \(b\) must therefore be chosen so that
\(e^{t\zeta-\frac{1}{3}t^3}\) is zero for both. (Note that \(\zeta\) is
a constant.) This is only possible if \(t=\infty\) and the real part of
\(t^3\) is positive:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Re(t^3) > 0 \Leftrightarrow 2\pi n -\frac{1}{2}\pi < \arg{t^3} < 2\pi n + \frac{1}{2}\pi \\
\Leftrightarrow 2\pi n -\frac{1}{2}\pi < 3 \arg{t} < 2\pi n + \frac{1}{2}\pi
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(n\) is an integer. Figure~\ref{fig:stokes_sol} is a diagram of
the complex t-plane, and \(a\) and \(b\) must each be at \(\infty\) in
one of the shaded sectors. They cannot both be in the same sector, for
then the integral would be zero. Hence the contour may be chosen in
three ways, as shown by the three curves \(C_1,C_2,C_3\), and the
solution would be

\[
E(\zeta) = \int_{C_1,C_2,C_3} \mathrm{d}t\ e^{t\zeta-\frac{1}{3}t^3}
\]

This might appear at first to give three independent solutions, but the
contour \(C_1\) and be distorted so as to coincide with the two contours
\(C_2+C_3\), so that

\[
\int_{C_1} = \int_{C_2} + \int_{C_3}
\]

and therefore there are only two independent solutions.

\emph{Proof}.

Note that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(e^{A}\neq 0\ \forall |A|<\infty\);
\item
  \(e^{A}=0 \Leftrightarrow\, A\rightarrow \infty\,\text{and}\,\Re(A)<0\).
\end{enumerate}

Therefore we have

\[
e^{-\frac{1}{3}t^3}\rightarrow 0\,\text{as}\, t\rightarrow \infty\,\text{and}\,\Re\Big(\frac{1}{3}t^3\Big)>0
\] In polar coordinates, let \(t=|t|e^{i\theta}\). Then

\[
t^3 = |t|^3 e^{i3\theta} = |t|^3 \big( \cos{3\theta} + i\sin{3\theta} \big)
\]

\[
\Re\Big(\frac{1}{3}t^3\Big)>0 \iff \cos{3\theta}>0 \iff 3\theta \in (-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}),\ (\frac{3\pi}{2},\frac{5\pi}{2}),\ (-\frac{3\pi}{2},-\frac{5}{2}\pi)
\]

□

Jeffreys (1956) defines two special
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_function}{Airy functions}
\(Ai(x), Bi(x)\) as follows

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:airy_func}{}{
\begin{aligned}
Ai(\zeta) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_1} \mathrm{d}t e^{-\frac{1}{3}t^3 + \zeta t} \\
Bi(\zeta) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \Big[\int_{C_2}+\int_{C_3}\Big]\mathrm{d}t e^{-\frac{1}{3}t^3 + \zeta t}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:airy_func}\end{equation}

Obviously he took the Fourier transform such that a coefficient \(2\pi\)
naturally appears. In Equation~\ref{eq:airy_func}, the contour \(C_1\)
can be distorted so as to coincide with the imaginary t-axis for almost
its whole length. It must be displaced slightly to the left of this axis
at its ends to remain in the shaded region at infinity. Let \(t=is\).
Then the Airy function of the first kind in Equation~\ref{eq:airy_func}
becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
Ai(\zeta) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i(\zeta s+\frac{1}{3}s^3)}ds \\
&=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\cos\Big(\zeta s+\frac{1}{3}s^3\Big)ds
\end{aligned}
\]

It is known as the Airy integral, which is the solution for
\(y\rightarrow 0\) as \(x\rightarrow\infty\). The other linearly
independent solution, the Airy function of the second kind, denoted
\(Bi(x)\), is defined as the solution with the same amplitude of
oscillation as \(Ai(x)\) as \(x\rightarrow -\infty\) which differs in
phase by \(\pi/2\):

\[
Bi(\zeta) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\Big[e^{-\frac{s^3}{3}+s\zeta} + \sin\Big(\zeta s+\frac{1}{3}s^3\Big)\Big]ds
\]

\(Ai(x)\) and \(Bi(x)\) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:airy}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:airy}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{_build/im/KeyNotes_plot_airy_.png}
\caption{Airy functions.}\label{fig:airy}
}
\end{figure}

As an interesting experiment, we can check if \(Ai(x)\) is recovered
from solving the second order ODE numerically:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Julia]
function plot_airy_ode()
   # Initial Conditions: y → 0 as x → ∞
   x₀ = [airyai(10.0)]
   dx₀ = [airyaiprime(10.0)]

   # Define the problem

      ddu .= t*u
   end

   # Pass to solvers
   prob = SecondOrderODEProblem(airy_equation, dx₀, x₀, tspan)
   sol = solve(prob, DPRKN6())

   # Extract solutions

\hypertarget{fig:airy_ode}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{_build/im/KeyNotes_plot_airy_ode_.png}
\caption{Numerical solution of Airy function of the first
kind.}\label{fig:airy_ode}
}
\end{figure}

Here we start from the right boundary and move towards the left.

Now, to find approximations for Airy functions, we use the method of
\emph{steepest descent}. This approximation is based on the assumption
that major contribution to the integral is from near the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point}{saddle point}. As an
example of saddle point, consider a complex function
\(\exp{f(z)}=e^{-z^2}\), where \(z=x+i y\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(z=\text{real} = x\), \(e^{-z^2}=e^{-x^2}\);
\item
  If \(z=\text{imag}=iy\), \(e^{-z^2}=e^{y^2}\).
\end{itemize}

The procedure goes as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Detour path of integral s.t. it passes through the saddle point of the
  integral, along the direction of steepest descent.
\item
  Obtain major contribution by integrating the Gaussian function.
\end{enumerate}

\[
I=\int_C \mathrm{d}t e^{f(t)},\quad f(t) = f(t_s) + (t-t_s)f^\prime(t_s) + \frac{1}{2}(t-t_s)^2 f^{\prime\prime}(t_s) + ...
\]

where \(f^\prime(t_s)=0\) at the saddle point \(t=t_s\) simplifies \(I\)
to the integral of a Gaussian function.

For \(Ai(\zeta)\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &= t\zeta -\frac{1}{3}t^3 \\
f^\prime(t_s)& = \zeta - {t_s}^2 = 0 \\
f^{\prime\prime}(t_s)& = -2t_s
\end{aligned}
\]

Consider \(\zeta>0\) (where the solution is either exponentially
decaying or growing.) Then

\[
\begin{aligned}
t_{s1} = -\sqrt{\zeta},\quad t_{s2} = \sqrt{\zeta} \\
f(t_{s1}) = -\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2},\quad f^{\prime\prime}(t_{s1}) = 2\zeta^{1/2}
\end{aligned}
\]

So

\[
\begin{aligned}
Ai(\zeta) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_1} \mathrm{d}t\ e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}+\zeta^{1/2}(t-t_s)^2}+... \\
&\approx\frac{1}{2\pi i} e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}\int_{C_1}\mathrm{d}t\ e^{\sqrt{\zeta}(t-t_s)^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(e^{\sqrt{\zeta}(t-t_s)^2}=e^{-\rho^2}\), where
\(\rho=\text{real}\) is the direction of steepest descent, and
\(\rho=\text{imag}\) is the direction of steepest ascent.

\[
\begin{aligned}
i\rho &= \pm \zeta^{1/4} (t-t_s) \\
\mathrm{d}t&=\frac{i \mathrm{d}\rho}{\zeta^{1/4}} \Rightarrow\ \mathrm{d}t \text{ is purely imaginary along steepest descent.}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then for \(\zeta>0\)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:airy_approxi_positive}{}{
\begin{aligned}
Ai(\zeta) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{id\rho}{\zeta^{1/4}}e^{-\rho^2} \nonumber \\
&=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}\zeta^{1/4}}e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}} \text{ as}\ \zeta\rightarrow \infty
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:airy_approxi_positive}\end{equation}

The ratio of accuracy is shown in the following table (LABEL???). In
practice, it is already a very good approximation when \(\zeta>3\).
(think of \(kL\gg 3\) for WKBJ solution! ???)

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llllll@{}}
\toprule
\(\zeta\) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 6 & \(\infty\) \\
\midrule
\endhead
ratio & 0.934 & 0.972 & 0.983 & 0.993 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Now, consider \(\zeta<0\). When \(\zeta\rightarrow-\infty\), we
anticipate oscillating behavior of \(Ai(\zeta)\). \(\zeta=-|\zeta|\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
f(t) &= \zeta t-\frac{1}{3}t^3 = -t|\zeta| - \frac{1}{3}t^3 \\
f^\prime(t) &= -|\zeta| - t^2 = 0 \\
f^{\prime\prime}(t) &= -2t
\end{array} \right. \\
\Rightarrow &f(t_{s1}) = i\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2} \\
&f^{\prime\prime}(t_{s1}) = 2i\sqrt{|\zeta|}
\end{aligned}
\]

so the contribution from \(t_{s1}\) is

\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}e^{i\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}}\int_{t_{s1}} e^{\frac{1}{2}(2i\sqrt{|\zeta|})(t-t_s)^2+...}
\]

Let \(-\rho^2=i\sqrt{|\zeta|}(t-t_{s1})^2\), differentiate on both sides
to get

\[
\mathrm{d}t = \pm\frac{e^{i\pi/4}}{|\zeta|^{1/4}}\mathrm{d}\rho
\]

Again, \(\rho=\text{real}\) is the direction of steepest descent at
\(t=t_{s1}\). Do the same to \(t_{s2}\), then by summing them up we have
for \(\zeta<0\),

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:airy_approxi_negative}{}{
\begin{aligned}
Ai(\zeta) &\approx \frac{1}{2\pi i} \Big[ e^{i\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i\pi/4}}{|\zeta|^{1/4}}\mathrm{d}\rho e^{-\rho^2} - e^{-i\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-i\pi/4}}{|\zeta|^{1/4}}\mathrm{d}\rho e^{-\rho^2} \Big] \\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \Big[ \frac{e^{i\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}+i\pi/4}}{{|\zeta|^{1/4}}} \sqrt{\pi} - \frac{e^{-i\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}-i\pi/4}}{{|\zeta|^{1/4}}} \sqrt{\pi} \Big]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:airy_approxi_negative}\end{equation}

An interesting application of the gradient descent method is to find
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling\%27s_approximation}{Stirling's
approximation}. Mathematically, we can proof that

\[
n! =\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\ e^{-t}t^n = \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\ e^{-t+n\ln{t}} \equiv \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\ e^{f(t)}
\]

and by following the steepest descent method,

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &= -t +n\ln{t} \\
f^\prime(t) &= -1 + n\frac{1}{t}=0 \\
f^{\prime\prime}(t) &= -n\frac{1}{t^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

we can find the approximation Stirling formula

\[
\begin{aligned}
n! &\approx \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\ e^{-n+n\ln{n}-\frac{1}{2n}(t-t_s)^2} \\
&=e^{-n}n^n \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\ e^{-\frac{1}{2n}(t-t_s)^2} \\
&=\sqrt{2n\pi}e^{-n}n^n
\end{aligned}
\]

The following table (LABEL???) show the goodness of approximation of
Stirling formula. In practice, it is already a very good approximation
when \(n>3\).

\subsection{Uniformly Valid WKBJ Solution Across the Turning
Point}\label{uniformly-valid-wkbj-solution-across-the-turning-point}}

In this section, we present the WKBJ solution that is uniformly valid
everywhere, even at the turning point.

Consider the standard equation,

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2E(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+k^2(x)E(x) = 0
\]

Let \(x=0\) be the turning point, i.e.~we assume that \(k^2(x)\) is a
monotonically decreasing function of \(x\) with \(k(0)=0\). For the
region \(x>0\), we first identify the exponentially decaying factor of
the Airy function, \(Ai(\zeta)\), to be the phase integral in the WKBJ
solution:

\[
-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2} = i \int_0^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime
\]

Note that this yields \(\zeta=\zeta(x)\), \emph{a known function of x}
(I confuse myself later about \(\zeta\) and \(x\)\ldots). The branch for
\(\zeta(x)\) is to be chosen so that for \(x>0\), \(\zeta\) is real and
positive.

We next verify that the uniformly valid solution to the standard
equation is simply

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:WKBJ_uniform_valid_sol}{}{
E(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\zeta^\prime(x)}}Ai(\zeta)
}\label{eq:WKBJ_uniform_valid_sol}\end{equation}

where the prime denotes a derivative. For large values of \(\zeta\), we
can use the asymptotic formula of \(Ai\)
Equation~\ref{eq:airy_approxi_positive}, and notice that

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\zeta^{1/2}\zeta^\prime = ik(x) \\
\zeta^\prime(x) = -i \frac{k(x)}{\zeta^{1/2}}
\end{aligned}
\]

we can see that Equation~\ref{eq:WKBJ_uniform_valid_sol} reduces to the
standard WKBJ solutions for large values of \(\zeta\)

\[
E(x)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\zeta^\prime(x)}}Ai(\zeta) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(x)}} e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(x)}}e^{ i \int_0^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime}
\]

We can also show that Equation~\ref{eq:WKBJ_uniform_valid_sol} is valid
for small values of \(\zeta\), i.e.~near the turning point at \(x=0\).
(Hint: Near \(x=0\), \(k^2(x)\) may be approximated by a linear function
of \(x\). This linear approximation then yields \(\zeta(x)\) as a linear
function of \(x\) according to
Equation~\ref{eq:WKBJ_uniform_valid_sol}.)

\emph{Ex}. Choose a smooth plasma density profile which monotonically
increases with \(x\) s.t.

\[
\frac{\omega_{pe}^2(x)}{\omega^2} = 1 + \tanh{x}
\]

and launch a wave of frequency \(\omega\) from \(x=-\infty\), the vacuum
region, toward the positive \(x\)-direction with
\(\frac{\omega^2}{c^2} = 10 \text{m}^{-2}\). (This is like launching a
wave from low \(B\) region into high \(B\) region.) Numerically
integrate the wave equation Equation~\ref{eq:ODE_Omode},

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} \Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}(x)}^2}{\omega^2} \Big]E = 0
\]

from some large positive values of \(x\), we get the results in
Figure~\ref{fig:Omode_sol}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:Omode_sol}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/WKBJ_sol_Omode.png}
\caption{Comparison between the WKBJ solution, uniformly valid solution
and numerical integral solution for the O-mode with monotonically
increasing density with \(x\).}\label{fig:Omode_sol}
}
\end{figure}

We know that away from \(x_t\), WKBJ solution works. To the left of
\(x_t\) (with \(\zeta<-3\)), Equation~\ref{eq:airy_approxi_negative}
gives

\[
Ai(\zeta) = \frac{1}{2i\sqrt{\pi}|\zeta|^{1/4}}\Big[ e^{i \frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}+i\frac{\pi}{4}} - e^{-\frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}-i\frac{\pi}{4}} \Big]
\]

Choose the branch s.t. \(\zeta{x}>0\) if \(x>x_t\); \(\zeta(x)<0\) if
\(x<x_t\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
E(x) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\zeta^\prime(x)}}Ai(\zeta) \\
&= \frac{C_3}{\sqrt{k(x)/|\zeta|^{1/2}}}\frac{1}{|\zeta|^{1/4}}\Big\{ e^{i \frac{2}{3}|\zeta|^{3/2}+i\frac{\pi}{4}} - c.c \Big\} \\
&= \frac{C_3}{\sqrt{k(x)}}\Big\{ e^{i(-\int_{x_t}^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime)+i\frac{\pi}{4}} - c.c \Big\} \\
&=\frac{C_3}{\sqrt{k(x)}}\Big\{ e^{-i\int_{x_t}^a k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime - i\int_a^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime+i\frac{\pi}{4}} -c.c \Big\} \\
&=\frac{C_4}{\sqrt{k(x)}}\Big\{ e^{-i \int_a^x k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime}-e^{i\int_{x_t}^a k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime } e^{2i\int_{x_t}^a k(x^\prime)\mathrm{d}x^\prime -i\frac{\pi}{2}} \Big\} \\
&=\frac{C_4}{\sqrt{k(x)}}\Big\{ e^{-i\int_a^x k \mathrm{d}x^\prime} + R\cdot e^{i\int_a^x k \mathrm{d}x^\prime}  \Big\},
\end{aligned}
\]

where

\[
C_4 = C_3 \cdot e^{-i \int_{x_t}^a k \mathrm{d}x^\prime + i\frac{\pi}{4}}
\]

and

\[
R = -e^{2i\int_{x_t}^a k \mathrm{d}x^\prime - i\frac{\pi}{2}} = i e^{2i\int_{x_t}^a k \mathrm{d}x^\prime} = i e^{-2i \int_{a}^{x_t}kdx^\prime}
\]

is the reflection coefficient at \(x=a\).

\hypertarget{sec:stokes_phenomenon}{%
\subsection{Stokes Phenomenon}\label{sec:stokes_phenomenon}}

In complex analysis the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_phenomenon}{Stokes
phenomenon} is that the asymptotic behavior of functions can differ in
different regions of the complex plane, and that these differences can
be described in a quantitative way.

\emph{Ex}. For the simple wave equation

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{dz^2} - E = 0
\]

the solution can be given in various forms

\[
\begin{aligned}
E=e^z,e^{-z},\cosh{z},\sinh{z} \\
E = \cosh{z}=\frac{1}{2}(e^z+e^{-z}) \Rightarrow
\left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
&E\sim\frac{1}{2}e^z\, z\rightarrow\infty \\
&E\sim\frac{1}{2}e^{-z}\, z\rightarrow-\infty
\end{array} \right. \\
E = \sinh{z}=\frac{1}{2}(e^z-e^{-z}) \Rightarrow
\left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
&E\sim\frac{1}{2}e^z\, z\rightarrow\infty \\
&E\sim\frac{-1}{2}e^{-z}\, z\rightarrow-\infty
\end{array} \right.
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that if a solution is exponentially growing in one direction, its
asymptotic solution can contain an arbitrary amount of the exponentially
decaying solution; that is, specifying an asymptotic growing solution in
one direction cannot completely specify the solution in the entire
complex plane.

The two linearly independent approximate solutions to Airy
Equation~\ref{eq:stokes} are the Airy function approximations from WKBJ
method:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}\zeta^2} - \zeta E = 0 \\
\Rightarrow &E(\zeta) = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
&Ai(\zeta)\sim \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}\zeta^{1/4}}e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}},\quad \zeta>0 \\
&Bi(\zeta)\sim \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}\zeta^{1/4}}e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}},\quad \zeta>0
\end{array} \right. \\
\end{aligned}
\]

which is very accurate for \(\zeta>3\) (see previous section).

Stokes found that you can add an arbitrary amount of \(Ai(\zeta)\) to
\(Bi(\zeta)\) without changing the behaviour of solution.
(\(Ai(\zeta)<O(\zeta^{-1})\)???)

We want to find \(\zeta\) s.t. \(E_{\text{WKBJ}}\) is purely
growing/decaying exponentially:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\zeta^{3/2} \text{is purely real} \iff (|\zeta|e^{i\theta})^{3/2} \text{is purely real} \iff \sin{\frac{3}{2}\theta} = 0,\ \theta=0,\pm\frac{2}{3}\pi,\pm\frac{4}{3}\pi
\end{aligned}
\]

The lines in the complex plane on which WKBJ solution is purely
growing/decaying exponentially are called \emph{Stokes lines}
(Figure~\ref{fig:stokes_line}). It is accompanied with \emph{anti-Stokes
lines} (in the opposite direction to Stokes lines), on which WKBJ
solution is purely oscillatory. The exponentially growing solution on
Stokes lines is called the \emph{dominant solution}; the decaying
solution on Stokes lines is called the \emph{sub-dominant/recessive
solution}. The sub-dominant solution will always becomes dominant in a
neighboring Stokes line. However, the inverse is not true. (It may
contain an amount of sub-dominant solution.) Each term changes from
dominant to subdominant, or the reverse, when \(\zeta\) crosses an
anti-Stokes line???

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:stokes_line}{%

\caption{Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines for WKBJ solution of Airy
Equation.}\label{fig:stokes_line}
}
\end{figure}

Even though we say ``arbitrary'', the analytic solution in the whole
complex plane possess a limit on that amount. The next question would
be: how much exponentially decaying solution can you add to the
exponentially growing solution? (Note that the asympotic series is also
a divergent series: more terms don't lead to high resolution accuracy! I
have questions on this part???)

For the asymptotic approximation solution of Airy
Equation~\ref{eq:stokes}, we need to define \(\arg(\zeta)\) properly to
make it single value. Let us choose the branch cut
\(-\pi\le\arg{\zeta}<\pi\). The complex plane is demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:stokes_line_Zplane}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:stokes_line_Zplane}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/StokesLine_Zplane.png}
\caption{Marked Stokes lines and regions for Airy
solution.}\label{fig:stokes_line_Zplane}
}
\end{figure}

Let us start from region I. The solution in region I is

\[
E_I \sim \zeta^{-1/4}\big[ A_1 e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}} + B_1 e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}\big]
\]

On \(S_1\), \(e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}\) is sub-dominant,
\(e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}\) is dominant. (The former would be
dominant on neighboring Stokes lines \(S_2\) and \(S_3\).) Crossing
\(S_2\) into region \(\text{II}_{\text{up}}\), we have

\[
E_{\text{II}_{\text{up}}} \sim \zeta^{-1/4} \Big[ \underbrace{A_1 e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}}_{\text{dominant}} + \underbrace{(\lambda_1 A_1 + B_1)e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}}_{\text{sub-dominant}} \Big]
\]

where \(\lambda_2\) is the Stokes constant on \(S_2\). The constant in
the subdominant term has changed by \(\lambda_2 A_1\) because the
differential equation is linear, and it cannot depend on \(B_1\).
Otherwise it would be unaltered if we added to the solution in region I
any multiple of the solution in which \(A_1=0\). (See
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-budden1961radio}{Budden, 1961}) 15.13.) Crossing
the branch cut to region \(\text{II}_{\text{down}}\),
\(\zeta^{\text{up}} = \zeta^{\text{down}}e^{i2\pi}\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
\zeta_{\text{up}}^{-1/4} = \zeta_{\text{down}}^{-1/4}e^{i2\pi(-1/4)} = i\zeta_{\text{down}}^{1/4} \\
\zeta_{\text{up}}^{3/2} = \zeta_{\text{down}}^{3/2}e^{i2\pi(3/2)} = -\zeta_{\text{down}}^{3/2}
\end{aligned}
\]

so

\[
E_{\text{II}_{\text{down}}} = -i \zeta_{\text{II}_{\text{down}}}^{1/4}\Big[ A_1 e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta_{\text{II}_{\text{down}}}^{3/2}} + (\lambda_2A_1 + B_1)e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta_{\text{II}_{\text{down}}}^{3/2}} \Big]
\]

We can also go clockwise from I to III, crossing \(S_1\),

\[
E_{III} \sim \zeta^{-1/4} \Big[ \underbrace{B_1 e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}}_{\text{dominant}} + \underbrace{(-\lambda_1 B_1 + A_1)e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}}_{\text{sub-dominant}} \Big]
\]

where \(\lambda_1\) is the Stokes constant on \(S_1\), and the minus
sign indicates the clockwise direction.

Crossing \(S_3\) from III to \(\text{II}_{\text{down}}\),

\[
E_{\text{II}_{\text{down}}} \sim \zeta^{-1/4} \Big[ \underbrace{(-\lambda_1B_1+A_1) e^{-\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}}_{\text{dominant}} + \underbrace{ [(-\lambda_3)(-\lambda_1 B_1+A_1)+B_1]e^{\frac{2}{3}\zeta^{3/2}}}_{\text{sub-dominant}} \Big]
\]

where \(\lambda_3\) is the Stokes constant on \(S_3\), and the minus
sign indicates the clockwise direction.

Since the solution to Airy Equation is analytic, the solutions in region
\(\text{II}_{\text{down}}\) obtained from two directions must be equal.
Therefore

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\lambda_1 B_1 + A_1 &= -i(\lambda_2 A_1 + B_1) \\
-\lambda_3 (-\lambda_1 B_1 + A_1) + B_1 &= -i A_1
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
i\lambda_2 + 1 & -\lambda_1 + i \\ -\lambda_3 + i & \lambda_3\lambda_1 + 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
A_1 \\ B_1
\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\
\Rightarrow \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = i
\end{aligned}
\]

All three Stokes constants are \(i\). For the Airy equation, the amount
of exponentially decaying solution you can have going from one Stokes
line to another is restricted to \(i\) in counter-clockwise direction.

\subsection{Application of Stokes Lines}\label{sec:stokes_application}}

\emph{Ex}.1 Reflection Coefficient from Stokes Constant ???

\emph{Ex}.2 O-mode

For EM O-mode wave in a non-magnetized plasma, the governing
Equation~\ref{eq:ODE_Omode} is rewritten here

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{dz^2} +k^2 E = 0,\quad k^2 = \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}\Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_p}^2(z)}{\omega^2} \Big]
\]

Let the turning point be \(z=z_t\). Near \(z_t\), let
\(k^2(z)=-p^2(z)(z-z_t)\) (Figure~\ref{fig:Omode_sol}), where \(p(z)\)
is real and positive for all real \(z\). Then

\[
k=\pm i p(z)(z-z_t)^{1/2}
\]

In the following we need to choose sign s.t. \(k\) is real and positive
on the anti-Stokes line \(AS_1\). (The figure of complex z plane is the
same as Figure~\ref{fig:stokes_line_Zplane} except that the center point
is \(z=z_t\). \(AS_1\) is the dashed line.)

To make \(z\) single value, define \(-\pi\le\arg{(z-z_t)}<\pi\). On
\(AS_1\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
k &= \pm ip(z)|z-z_t|^{1/2} e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}} \\
&=\mp|p(z)(z-z_t)|^{1/2} \\
&=\mp |k|
\end{aligned}
\]

We choose the second sign for right propagating wave, which has

\[
k=-ip(z)(z-z_t)^{1/2}
\]

The sign is important here because it determines the propagation
direction.

For \(z\) on \(S_1\), \(\arg{(z-z_t)} = 0\).

\[
k=-ip(z)|z-z_t|^{1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}0}=-i|k|
\]

In region I (between \(S_1\) and \(S_2\))

\[
E_I \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t\pm i\int_{z_t}^{z}kdz^\prime}\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t\pm \int_{z_t}^z |k|dz^\prime}
\]

For a decaying (subdominant) solution we must use minus (lower) sign, so

\[
E_I \sim E_{S_1} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t- \int_{z_t}^z kdz^\prime}
\]

Crossing \(S_2\) into region \(II_{up}\),

\[
E_{S_2} \sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t}\Big[ \underbrace{e^{-i\int_{z_t}^z k dz^\prime}}_{\text{dominant on } S_2} + \underbrace{i e^{i\int_{z_t}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{sub-dominant on }S_2} \Big] = E_{AS_1}
\]

where the first term represents the reflected wave, and the second term
represents the incident wave. Since the magnitude of the incident and
reflected wave is the same, the reflection coefficient should be 1, and
the absorption coefficient should be 0. (In fact, there is a transmitted
wave that is exponentially decay. WKBJ method cannot resolve this
exponentially small value.)

\emph{Ex}.3 Bohr-Sommerfield Quantization Rule

This is the classical potential well problem, where the two boundaries
are \(z=z_1\) and \(z=z_2\).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:potential_well}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Potential_well.png}
\caption{Potential well.}\label{fig:potential_well}
}
\end{figure}

Schrödinger equation reads

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\Psi}{dz^2} - \frac{2m}{{\hbar}^2}\big[ E-V(z)\big]\Psi = 0
\]

Imagine there is an potential well between \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:potential_well}: what are the allowable energy state?

In this case, \(k^2 = -\frac{2m}{{\hbar}^2}\big[ E-V(z)\big]\). Wave
travelling to the right has positive \(k(z)\), while wave travelling to
the left has negative \(k(z)\). Following the discussion of reflection
coefficient,

\[
\begin{aligned}
R =  i e^{-2i \int_{0}^{z_2}k(z^\prime)dz^\prime} \\
R^\prime =  i e^{+2i \int_{0}^{z_1}k(z^\prime)dz^\prime}
\end{aligned}
\]

For waves bouncing back and forth inside the well, we must have

\[
\begin{aligned}
RR^\prime = 1 \\
\Rightarrow (-1)e^{-2i \int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime} = 1 \\
\Rightarrow \int_{z_1}^{z_2}k(z^\prime)dz^\prime = \pi (n+\frac{1}{2}),\ n=0,1,2,3,...
\end{aligned}
\]

which is called the \emph{Bohr-Sommerfield quantization rule}.

Another way to do this problem is by recognizing the Stokes and
anti-Stokes lines in the complex z plane and match the solution in the
whole domain. Figure needed!!! As the opposite in HW8.1\%k2 .vs. z ,
Stokes line

\[
k^2 = -\frac{2m}{{\hbar}^2}\big[ E-V(z)\big] \equiv -p^2(z)(z-z_1)(z-z_2)
\]

where for large z, we must choose a minus sign in front of \(p(z)\) for
\(p(z)\) to be real and positive. So

\[
k = \pm i p(z)(z-z_1)^{1/2}(z-z_2)^{1/2}
\]

Then for a single-value solution, pick

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\pi\le\arg{(z-z_1)}<\pi \\
-\frac{\pi}{2}\le\arg{(z-z_2)}<\frac{3\pi}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

For \(z\) on \(AS_1\),

\[
k(z) = \pm ip(z)|z-z_1|^{1/2} e^{i\frac{1}{2}\cdot0}\cdot |z-z_2|^{1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}\cdot \pi} = \pm i |k|e^{i\frac{1}{2}\pi} = \mp |k|
\]

For a real and positive \(k\) (right-traveling wave), we must choose the
lower sign \(+\), so

\[
k =- i p(z)(z-z_1)^{1/2}(z-z_2)^{1/2}
\]

For \(z\) on \(S_1\), \[
k =- i p(z)|z-z_1|^{1/2}|z-z_2|^{1/2}= -i |k|
\]

For \(z\) on \(S_4\),

\[
k =- i p(z)|z-z_1|^{1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}\pi}|z-z_2|^{1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}\pi}= i |k|
\]

So

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:well_k}{}{
k(z) =
\begin{cases}
-i|k| & z>z_2 \\
|k| & z_1<z<z_2 \\
i|k| & z<z_1
\end{cases}
}\label{eq:well_k}\end{equation}

On \(S_1\),

\[
\Psi_{E_{S_1}} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{\pm i \int_{z_2}^{z} kdz^\prime} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\int_{z_2}^{z}kdz^\prime}
\]

such that this is sub-dominant on \(S_1\) (\(k=-i|k|\)).

Crossing \(S_2\) into region I, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:psi_I_1}{}{
\Psi_I \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\Big\{ \underbrace{e^{-i\int_{z_2}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{dominant on }S_2} + i\underbrace{e^{+i\int_{z_2}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{subdominant on }S_2} \Big\}
}\label{eq:psi_I_1}\end{equation}

On \(S_4\),

\[
\Psi_{S_4}\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{\pm i \int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime},
\]

where minus sign is chosen s.t. it is subdominant on \(S_4\).

Crossing \(S_3\) into region I in the clockwise direction, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:psi_I_2}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\Psi_I &\sim \Big\{ \underbrace{e^{-i\int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{dominant on }S_3} - i\underbrace{e^{+i\int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{subdominant on }S_3} \Big\} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\Big\{ e^{-i\int_{z_2}^z kdz^\prime}\cdot e^{-i\int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime} - ie^{i\int_{z_2}^z kdz^\prime}\cdot e^{i\int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime} \Big\}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:psi_I_2}\end{equation}

Because the solution is analytic, Equation~\ref{eq:psi_I_1} and
Equation~\ref{eq:psi_I_2} should be equal, therefore

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{1}{e^{-i\int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime}} = \frac{i}{-ie^{i\int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime}} \\
\Rightarrow& e^{2i\int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime} = -1 = e^{i(\pi+2n\pi)},\quad n=0,1,2,3,... \\
\Rightarrow& \int_{z_1}^{z_2}kdz^\prime = (\frac{1}{2}+n)\pi,\quad n=0,1,2,3,...
\end{aligned}
\]

\emph{Ex}.4 Tunneling Problem

Instead of a potential well, now we consider another classical tunneling
problem, where \(E>V\) if \(z_1<z<z_2\).

\[
k^2(z) = \pm p^2(z)(z-z_1)(z-z_2) = p^2(z)(z-z_1)(z-z_2)
\]

where the plus sign is chosen s.t. \(p(z)\) is real and positive for all
real z, and then

\[
k = p(z)(z-z_1)^{1/2}(z-z_2)^{1/2}
\]

Define arguments as follows

\[
0\le \arg{z-z_2} < 2\pi,\quad -\pi<\arg{z-z_1} \le \pi
\]

to remove the ambiguity in the branch in the expression of \(k\).

Since \(z=z_1\), \(z=z_2\) are simple turning points (with different
slope in linear approximation), the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are
shown in Figure needed!!!

The branch cut defined as above give the following values of \(k\) on
the real \(z\) axis:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tunnel_k}{}{
k(z) =
\begin{cases}
|k| & z>z_2 \\
i|k| & z_1<z<z_2 \\
-|k| & z<z_1
\end{cases}
}\label{eq:tunnel_k}\end{equation}

On \(AS_1\), the solution

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tunnel_AS1}{}{
E\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t+i \int_{z_2}^z kdz^\prime}
}\label{eq:tunnel_AS1}\end{equation}

represents the outgoing wave propagating to \(z=\infty\).

On \(S_2\), solution Equation~\ref{eq:tunnel_AS1} behaves like
\(E\sim e^{\int_b^z |k|dz^\prime}\) which is dominant on \(S_2\) with
respect to \(z=z_2\). Thus, on \(S_1\), it is subdominant.

On crossing \(S_1\) from \(AS_1\), solution Equation~\ref{eq:tunnel_AS1}
remains valid. In fact, it is valid in the region bounded by \(S_1\),
\(S_2\) and \(S_3\). Note that it is subdominant on \(S_2\) with respect
to \(z=z_1\) (because we just showed that it is dominant on \(S_2\) with
respect to \(z=z_2\)). Thus, we rewrite the solution as

\[
E\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t + i\int_{z_2}^{z_1} kdz^\prime}\cdot \underbrace{e^{i\int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{subdominant on }\ S_2 w.r.t\ z=a}
\]

which becomes dominant on \(S_3\). Upon crossing \(S_3\), this solution
becomes

\[
E\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t + i\int_{z_2}^{z_1} kdz^\prime} \big[ \underbrace{e^{i\int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{dominant on }S_3} + \underbrace{ie^{-i\int_{z_1}^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{subdominant on }S_3}  \big]
\]

where we pick up the Stokes constant \(i\) and the subdominant solution,
represented by the last term of the solution.

Now, this is the solution on \(AS_4\) (\(z<z_1\)). Referring to
Equation~\ref{eq:tunnel_k}, we see that the first term of the solution
represents the reflected wave, and the second term the incident wave
from \(z=-\infty\). Since the incident wave and reflected wave have
equal amplitude, we have

\[
|R|^2 = 1
\]

The transmitted wave has unit amplitude (see Eq.(\ref{eq:tunnel_AS1})).
The incident wave has amplitude \(e^{i\int_a^b kdz^\prime}(i)\). Thus,

\[
|T|^2 = \frac{1}{\big| e^{i\int_{z_1}^{z_2} kdz^\prime}(i) \big|^2} = \frac{1}{\big| e^{i\int_{z_1}^{z_2} i|k|dz^\prime}(i) \big|^2}  = e^{-2\int_{z_1}^{z_2} |k|dz}
\]

where \(z_1,z_2\) are far apart, i.e.~\(|T|^2\) is exponentially small.

Note: \(|R|\) and \(|T|\) above are not valid if \(z_1,z_2\) are close
to each other. The correct transmission coefficient, for general valies
of \(z_1,z_2\) is

\[
|T|^2 = \frac{e^{-2\int_{z_1}^{z_2} |k|dz}}{1+e^{-2\int_{z_1}^{z_2} |k|dz}}
\]

and the reflection coefficient is

\[
|R|^2 = 1- |T|^2
\]

\emph{Ex}.5 Two waves: one is launched from \(z=+\infty\), incident onto
a resonant layer at \(z=a (a>0)\), and the other launched from
\(z=-\infty\), incident onto a absorption layer at \(z=0\), with the
model equation

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E(z)}{dz} + {k_0}^2 \Big( \frac{z}{z-a}\Big) E(z) = 0
\]

This looks like a similar case for ECRH.

\[
k^2(z) =  {k_0}^2 \Big( \frac{z}{z-a}\Big) \Rightarrow k(z) = k_0 z^{1/2}(z-a)^{-1/2}
\]

where \(k_0\) is real and positive.

Define arguments as follows

\[
-\frac{3\pi}{2}\le \arg{z} < \frac{\pi}{2},\quad -\frac{3\pi}{2}<\arg{z-a} \le \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

to remove the ambiguity in the branch in the expression of \(k\).

For \(z\) on \(AS_1\),

\[
k = k_0 |z|^{1/2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}0}|z-a|^{-1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}0} = |k|
\]

For \(z\) on \(S_1\),

\[
k = k_0 |z|^{1/2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}0}|z-a|^{-1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}\pi} = i|k|
\]

For \(z\) on \(AS_2\),

\[
k = k_0 |z|^{1/2}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(-\pi)}|z-a|^{-1/2}e^{i\frac{-1}{2}(-\pi)} = |k|
\]

Then the branch cut defined as above give the following values of \(k\)
on the real \(z\) axis:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tunnel_k2}{}{
k(z) =
\begin{cases}
|k| & z>a \\
i|k| & 0<z<a \\
|k| & z<0
\end{cases}
}\label{eq:tunnel_k2}\end{equation}

For wave launched from large magnetic field side \(z=+\infty\) going to
\(z=-\infty\) on \(AS_3\), the solution on \(AS_3\) is (Note that even
though \(z\) is negative, it is the upper limit of the integral and k is
positive. It took me a long time to get the right sign here for a left
propagating wave.)

\[
E\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t- i \int_0^z kdz^\prime}
\] This solution behaves like

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_AS3}{}{
E\sim  \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} e^{-i\omega t- i \int_0^z i|k|dz^\prime} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} e^{-i\omega t + \int_0^z |k|dz^\prime}
}\label{eq:wave_AS3}\end{equation}

on \(S_1\). Thus, it is dominant on \(S_1\) with respect to \(z=0\); it
is subdominant on the neighboring Stokes line \(S_2\). Thus solution
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_AS3} remains valid upon crosing Stokes line
\(S_2\). It is the solution in region I, bounded by \(S_1\) and \(S_2\).
Since it is dominant on \(S_1\) with respect to \(z=0\), it is
subdominant on \(S_1\) with respect to \(z=a\). So we can write it as

\[
E \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t - i\int_0^a kdz^\prime}\cdot \underbrace{e^{-i\int_a^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{subdominant on }\ S_1\ w.r.t.\ z=a}
\]

which is also the incident wave from \(z=0\). This is the solution in
region I as well as on \(AS_1\) (\(k=|k|\)). So it is the incident wave
solution from \(z=\infty\). The reflection coefficient must be 0!

The transmisson coefficient is then

\[
\begin{aligned}
|T|^2 &= \Big| \frac{E(z=-\infty)}{E(z=\infty)} \Big|^2 = \frac{1}{|e^{-i\int_0^a kdz}|^2} \notag \\
&= e^{-2\int_0^a |k| dz} = e^{-2\int_0^a k_0 \sqrt{\frac{z}{a-z}}dz}
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(z=a\sin^2\theta\), we can finally have

\[
|T|^2 = e^{-k_0 a\pi}
\]

The fraction of power absorbed by resonance is

\[
1-|R|^2 - |T|^2 = 1-e^{-k_0 a \pi}
\]

Note: these expressions of \(|T|^2, \ |R|^2\) are valid even if \(a\) is
small.

For wave launched from low magnetic field side \(z=-\infty\),

\[
E_{AS_1} \sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t + i \int_a^z kdz^\prime}
\]

On \(S_1\), a subdominant (decaying) solution with respect to \(z=0\) is

\[
E_{S_1}\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t+i\int_0^z i|k|dz^\prime}
\]

In regions I bounded by \(S_1,\ S_2\) and \(AS_1\),

\[
E_I \sim E_{S_1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{i\int_a^0 kdz^\prime}\cdot e^{i\int_0^z kdz^\prime}
\]

\(E_{S_1}\) is dominant on \(S_1\) with respect to \(z=a\), but is
subdominant on \(S_1\) with respect to \(z=0\).

Crossing \(S_2\) into \(AS_2\),

\[
E_{AS_2}\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}e^{-i\omega t}\cdot e^{i\int_a^0 kdz^\prime}\Big[ \underbrace{e^{i\int_0^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{dominant on }S_3} - i \underbrace{e^{-i\int_0^z kdz^\prime}}_{\text{subdominant on }S_3} \Big],
\]

where the first term represents the reflected wave, and the second term
represents the incident wave.

The transmission coefficient is

\[
\begin{aligned}
T &= \Big| \frac{E(z=\infty)}{E(z=-\infty)} \Big| \\
&=\Big|\frac{\sqrt{k(-\infty)}}{\sqrt{k(\infty)}} \Big| \Big| \frac{e^{i\int_a^\infty kdz}}{e^{i\int_a^0 kdz}\cdot e^{i\int_0^{-\infty} kdz}} \Big| \\
&=\frac{1}{\big| e^{i\int_a^0 i|k|dz} \big|} = e^{-\int_0^a |k|dz}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then the transmission coefficient in power is

\[
T^2 = e^{-2\int_0^a k \sqrt{|\frac{z}{z-a}|}dz^\prime } = e^{-k_0 a \pi}
\]

where the last equivalence requires some transformation tricks. If
\(a\sim\lambda, k_0 = 2\pi/\lambda\), the transmitted power fraction is
on the order of \(e^{-20}\sim 10^{-9}\).

The reflection coefficient is zero and that the transmission coefficient
(in power) is \(T=e^{-k_0 a\pi}\). Thus, the fraction \(1-T\) of the
incident power is absorbed by that resonant layer.

In physics we frequently have to deal with unit conversions. A solid
understanding of the unit system and normalization methods paves the
path for understanding the scales behind systems.

\hypertarget{theoretical-mechanics}{%
\section{Theoretical Mechanics}\label{theoretical-mechanics}}

Newtonian mechanics is great, but theoretical mechanics is marvellous.
It does not tell you anything new, but let you think of the same thing
from a different prospective. Theoretical mechanics takes advantage of a
system's constraints to solve problems. The constraints limit the
\emph{degrees of freedom} the system can have, and can be used to reduce
the number of coordinates needed to solve for the motion. The formalism
is well suited to arbitrary choices of coordinates, known in the context
as \emph{generalized coordinates}. The kinetic and potential energies of
the system are expressed using these generalized coordinates or momenta,
and the equations of motion can be readily set up, thus analytical
mechanics allows numerous mechanical problems to be solved with greater
efficiency than fully vectorial methods. \emph{It does not always work
for non-conservative forces or dissipative forces like friction, in
which case one may revert to Newtonian mechanics}.

\hypertarget{generalized-coordinates}{%
\subsection{Generalized Coordinates}\label{generalized-coordinates}}

In Newtonian mechanics, one customarily uses all three Cartesian
coordinates, or other 3D coordinate system, to refer to a body's
position during its motion. In physical systems, however, some structure
or other system usually constrains the body's motion from taking certain
directions and pathways. So a full set of Cartesian coordinates is often
unneeded, as the constraints determine the evolving relations among the
coordinates, which relations can be modeled by equations corresponding
to the constraints. In the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, the
constraints are incorporated into the motion's geometry, reducing the
number of coordinates to the minimum needed to model the motion. These
are known as generalized coordinates, denoted
\(q_i\, (i = 1, 2, 3...)\).

\hypertarget{dalemberts-principle}{%
\subsection{D'Alembert's Principle}\label{dalemberts-principle}}

This principle is the analogy of Newton's second law in theoretical
mechanics. It states that infinitesimal virtual work done by a force
across reversible displacements is zero, which is the work done by a
force consistent with ideal constraints of the system. The idea of a
constraint is useful --- since this limits what the system can do, and
can provide steps to solving for the motion of the system. The equation
for D'Alembert's principle is:

\[
\delta W = \mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{q} = 0
\]

where

\[
\mathbf{Q} = (Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_N)
\]

are the generalized forces (script Q instead of ordinary Q is used here
to prevent conflict with canonical transformations below) and
\(\mathbf{q}\) are the generalized coordinates. This leads to the
generalized form of Newton's laws in the language of theoretical
mechanics:

\[
\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{\partial T}{\partial\dot{\mathbf{q}}} \Big) - \frac{\partial T}{\partial\mathbf{q}}
\]

where T is the total kinetic energy of the system, and the notation

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{q}} = \Big( \frac{\partial}{\partial q_1},\frac{\partial}{\partial q_2}, ..., \frac{\partial}{\partial q_N} \Big)
\]

\hypertarget{lagrangian-mechanics}{%
\subsection{Lagrangian Mechanics}\label{lagrangian-mechanics}}

\textbf{Lagrangian and Euler--Lagrange equations}

The introduction of generalized coordinates and the fundamental
Lagrangian function:

\[
L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t) = T(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t) - V(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)
\]

where \(T\) is the total kinetic energy and \(V\) is the total potential
energy of the entire system, then either following the calculus of
variations or using the above formula --- lead to the Euler-Lagrange
equations;

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\mathbf{q}}} \Big) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial\mathbf{q}}
\]

which are a set of N second-order ordinary differential equations, one
for each \(q_i(t)\). This formulation identifies the actual path
followed by the motion as a selection of the path over which the time
integral of kinetic energy is least, assuming the total energy to be
fixed, and imposing no conditions on the time of transit.

\hypertarget{hamiltonian-mechanics}{%
\subsection{Hamiltonian Mechanics}\label{hamiltonian-mechanics}}

\textbf{Hamiltonian and Hamilton's equations}

The Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian replaces the generalized
coordinates and velocities \((\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}})\) with
\((\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})\); the generalized coordinates and the
generalized momenta conjugate to the generalized coordinates:

\[
\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\mathbf{q}}} = \Big(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_1},\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_2},,...,\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_N} \Big) = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_N)
\]

and introduces the Hamiltonian (which is in terms of generalized
coordinates and momenta):

\[
H(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p},t) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{q}} - L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)
\]

This leads to the Hamilton's equations:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial\mathbf{q}},\quad\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}}
\]

which are now a set of 2N first-order ordinary differential equations,
one for each \(q_i(t)\) and \(p_i(t)\). Another result from the Legendre
transformation relates the time derivatives of the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian:

\[
\frac{dH}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}
\]

which is often considered one of Hamilton's equations of motion
additionally to the others. The generalized momenta can be written in
terms of the generalized forces in the same way as Newton's second law:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = \mathbf{Q}
\]

One interesting application of the Hamilton's equation in plasma physics
is the prove of Vlasov equation (See Giulia's notes)

\[
\frac{df(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p},t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0
\]

You may also find the application in deriving the gyrokinetic equations.

\hypertarget{wavelet-analysis}{%
\section{Wavelet Analysis}\label{wavelet-analysis}}

Wavelet Transform (WT) decomposes a function into a set of wavelets. A
Wavelet is a wave-like oscillation that is localized in time. Two basic
properties of a wavelet are \emph{scale} and \emph{location}.

Wavelet is a predecessor of Fourier Tranform (FT), which provides better
results when dealing with changing background. It is the de-facto method
for modern wave analysis. The key advantages of WT compared with FT are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fewer ``hard'' parameters to tune in WT. For example, if you want to
  make a spectrogram with FT, you need to specify the size of local
  DFTs. In WT you do not need to worry about this; instead the validity
  of the result can be shown by the cone of influence. In a sense, FT
  makes immediate conversion from time to frequency domain, while WT let
  you choose the intermediate steps you wish for.
\item
  Flexible forms of wavelets to choose from. In practice, if you have
  any prior knowledge to the signal you want to identify, you can find
  for an appropriate wavelet that is close to that shape, which gives
  better fitting compared to the sinuisoidal functions in FT.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec:single}{%
\chapter{Single-Particle Motions}\label{sec:single}}

What makes plasmas particularly difficult to analyze is the fact that
the densities fall in an intermediate range. Fluids like water are so
dense that the motions of individual molecules do not have to be
considered. Collisions dominate, and the simple equations of ordinary
fluid dynamics suffice. At the other extreme in very low-density
devices, only single-particle trajectories need to be considered;
collective effects are often unimportant. Plasma behaves sometimes like
fluids, and sometimes like a collection of individual particles. The
first step in learning how to deal with this schizophrenic personality
is to understand how single particles behave in electric and magnetic
fields.

Here we assume that the EM fields are prescribed and not affected by the
charged particles. The associated approach is often called \emph{test
particle}.

\hypertarget{uniform-e-and-b-fields}{%
\section{Uniform E and B Fields}\label{uniform-e-and-b-fields}}

The convention here is that velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) represents single
particle velocity as you will see through most of this chapter.

\hypertarget{e0}{%
\subsection{E=0}\label{e0}}

In this case, a charged particle has a simple cyclotron gyration. The
equation of motion is

\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}
\]

Taking \(\widehat{z}\) to be the direction of \(\mathbf{B}\)
(\(\mathbf{B} = B\widehat{z}\)), we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
m\dot{v}_x = qB v_y,\quad m\dot{v}_y = -qB v_x,\quad m\dot{v}_z = 0, \\
\ddot{v}_x = \frac{qB}{m}\dot{v}_y = -\Big( \frac{qB}{m}\Big)^2 v_x \\
\ddot{v}_y = \frac{qB}{m}\dot{v}_x = -\Big( \frac{qB}{m}\Big)^2 v_y
\end{aligned}
\]

This describes a simple harmonic oscillator at the \emph{cyclotron
frequency}, which we define to be

\[
\omega_c \equiv \frac{| q | B}{m}
\]

By the convention we have chosen, \(\omega_c\) is always nonnegative.
The unit of \(\omega_c\) in SI units is rad/s. To convert it to hertz,
we need to divide it by \(2\pi\). The solution of velocity is then

\[
v_{x,y} = v_\perp \exp(\pm i \omega_c t + i\delta_{x,y})
\]

The \(\pm\) denote the sign of q. We may choose the phase \(\delta\) so
that

\[
v_x = v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} = \dot{x}
\]

where \(v_\perp\) is a positive constant denoting the speed in the plane
perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\). Then

\[
v_y  = \frac{m}{qB} \dot{v}_x = \pm \frac{1}{\omega_c}\dot{v}_x = \pm i v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} = \dot{y}
\]

Integrating once again, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
x - x_0 &= -i\frac{v_\perp}{\omega_c}e^{i\omega_c t} \\
y - y_0 &= \pm i\frac{v_\perp}{\omega_c}e^{i\omega_c t}
\end{aligned}
\]

We define the \emph{Larmor radius} to be

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:larmor_radius}{}{
r_L \equiv \frac{v_\perp}{\omega_c} = \frac{mv_\perp}{|q| B}
}\label{eq:larmor_radius}\end{equation}

Note that \(2\pi\) does not appear in Equation~\ref{eq:larmor_radius}!

Taking the real part of the positions, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
x - x_0 &= r_L\sin\omega_c t \\
y - y_0 &= \pm r_L \cos\omega_c t
\end{aligned}
\]

This describes a circular orbit about a \emph{guiding center}
(\(x_0, y_0\)) which is fixed. The direction of the gyration is always
such that the magnetic field generated by the charged particle is
opposite to the externally imposed field. Plasma particles, therefore,
tend to \emph{reduce} the magnetic field, and plasmas are
\emph{diamagnetic}. In addition to this motion, there is an arbitrary
velocity \(v_z\) along \(\mathbf{B}\) which is not affected by
\(\mathbf{B}\). The trajectory of a charged particle in space is, in
general, a helix.

\hypertarget{finite-e}{%
\subsection{Finite E}\label{finite-e}}

If now we allow an electric field to be present, the motion will be
found to be the sum of two motions: the usual circular Larmor gyration
plus a drift of the guiding center. We may choose \(\mathbf{E}\) to lie
in the x-z plane so that \(E_y = 0\). As before, the z component of
velocity is unrelated to the transverse components and can be treated
separately. The equations of motion is now

\[
m\dot{\mathbf{v}} = q( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} )
\]

whose z component is

\[
\dot{v_z} = \frac{q}{m}E_z
\]

or

\[
v_z = \frac{qE_z}{m}t + v_{z0}
\]

This is a straightforward acceleration along \(\mathbf{B}\). The
transverse components are

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{v_x} &= \frac{q}{m}E_x \pm \omega_c v_y \\
\dot{v_y} &= 0 \mp \omega_c v_x
\end{aligned}
\]

Differentiating, we have (for constant \(\mathbf{E}\))

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &= -\omega_c^2 v_x \\
\ddot{v}_y &= \mp \omega_c \Big( \frac{q}{m}E_x \pm \omega_c v_y \Big) = -\omega_c^2 \Big( v_y + \frac{E_x}{B} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

We can write this as

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\Big( v_y + \frac{E_x}{B} \Big) = -\omega_c^2\Big( v_y + \frac{E_x}{B} \Big)
\]

so that it reduces to the previous case if we replace \(v_y\) by
\(v_y + (E_x/B)\). The velocity solution is then replaced by

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_x &= v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} \\
v_y &= \pm v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} - \frac{E_x}{B}
\end{aligned}
\]

The Larmor motion is the same as before, but there is superimposed a
drift \(\mathbf{v}_{gc}\) of the guiding center in the \(-y\) direction
(for \(E_x > 0\)).

To obtain a general formula for \(\mathbf{v}_{gc}\), we can solve the
momentum equation in vector form. We may omit the
\(m \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}/\mathrm{d}t\) term, since this term gives only
the circular motion at \(\omega_c\), which we already know about. Then
the momentum equation becomes

\[
\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} = 0
\]

Taking the cross product with \(\mathbf{B}\), we have

\[
\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{v}B^2 - \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{B})
\]

The transverse components with respect to \(\mathbf{B}\) of this
equation are

\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}/B^2 \equiv \mathbf{v}_E
\]

We define this to be \(\mathbf{v}_E\), the electric field drift of the
guiding center. In magnitude, this drift is

\[
v_E = \frac{E(\text{V/m})}{B(\text{tesla})}\frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}}
\]

It is important to note that \(\mathbf{v}_E\) is independent of q, m,
and \(v_\perp\). The reason is obvious from the following physical
picture. In the first half-cycle of the ion's orbit, it gains energy
from the electric field and increases in \(v_\perp\) and, hence, in
\(r_L\). In the second half-cycle, it loses energy and decreases in
\(r_L\). This difference in \(r_L\) on the left and right sides of the
orbit causes the drift \(v_E\). A negative electron gyrates in the
opposite direction but also gains energy in the opposite direction; it
ends up drifting in the same direction as an ion. For particles of the
same velocity but different mass, the lighter one will have smaller
\(r_L\) and hence drift less per cycle. However, its gyration frequency
is also larger, and the two effects exactly cancel. Two particles of the
same mass but different energy would have the same \(\omega_c\). The
slower one will have smaller \(r_L\) and hence gain less energy from
\(\mathbf{E}\) in a half-cycle. However, for less energetic particles
the fractional change in \(r_L\) for a given change in energy is larger,
and these two effects cancel.

The three-dimensional orbit in space is therefore a slanted helix with
changing pitch.

\hypertarget{sec:gravity_field}{%
\subsection{Gravitational Field}\label{sec:gravity_field}}

The foregoing result can be applied to other forces by replacing
\(q\mathbf{E}\) in the equation of motion by a general force
\(\mathbf{F}\). The guiding center drift caused by \(\mathbf{F}\) is
then

\[
\mathbf{v}_f = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]

In particular, if \(\mathbf{F}\) is the force of gravity
\(m\mathbf{g}\), there is a drift

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gravity_drift}{}{
\mathbf{v}_g = \frac{m}{q}\frac{\mathbf{g}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
}\label{eq:gravity_drift}\end{equation}

This is similar to the drift \(\mathbf{v}_E\) in that it is
perpendicular to both the force and \(\mathbf{B}\), but it differs in
one important respect. The drift \(\mathbf{v}_g\) changes sign with the
particle's charge. Under a gravitational force, ions and electrons drift
in opposite directions, so there is a net current density in the plasma
given by

\[
\mathbf{j} = n(m_i+m_e)\frac{\mathbf{g}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]

The physical reason for this drift is again the change in Larmor radius
as the particle gains and loses energy in the gravitational field. Now
the electrons gyrate in the opposite sense to the ions, but the force on
them is in the same direction, so the drift is in the opposite
direction. The magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}_g\) is usually negligible, but
when the lines of force (i.e.~magnetic field lines) are curved, there is
an effective gravitational force due to centrifugal force. This force,
which is not negligible, is independent of mass; this is why we did not
stress the m dependence of the drift here. Centrifugal force is the
basis of a plasma instability called the ``gravitational'' instability,
which has nothing to do with real gravity.

\hypertarget{nonuniform-b-field}{%
\section{Nonuniform B Field}\label{nonuniform-b-field}}

Now that the concept of a guiding center drift is firmly established, we
can discuss the motion of particles in inhomogeneous fields ---
\(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) fields which vary in space or time.
For uniform fields we were able to obtain exact expressions for the
guiding center drifts. As soon as we introduce inhomogeneity, the
problem becomes too complicated to solve exactly. To get an approximate
answer, it is customary to expand in the small ratio \(r_L/L\), where L
is the scale length of the inhomogeneity. This type of theory, called
\emph{orbit theory}, can become extremely involved. We shall examine
only the simplest cases, where only one inhomogeneity occurs at a time.

\hypertarget{b-b-grad-b-drift}{%
\subsection{∇B ⊥ B: Grad-B Drift}\label{b-b-grad-b-drift}}

Here the magnetic field lines are straight, but their density increases,
say, in the y direction. We can anticipate the result by using our
simple physical picture. The gradient in \textbar B\textbar{} causes the
Larmor radius to be larger at the bottom of the orbit than at the top,
and this should lead to a drift, in opposite directions for ions and
electrons, perpendicular to both B and \(\nabla B\). The drift velocity
should obviously be proportional to \(r_L/L\) and to \(v_\perp\).

Consider the Lorentz force \(\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\),
averaged over a gyration. Clearly, \(\bar{F}_x = 0\), since the particle
spends as much time moving up as down. We wish to calculate
\(\bar{F}_y\), in an approximate fashion, by using the \emph{undisturbed
orbit} of the particle to find the average. The undisturbed orbit is
given by the solution in the first section for a uniform \(\mathbf{B}\)
field. Taking the real part of the solution for \(v_x\) and \(y\), we
have

\[
F_y = -q v_x B_z(y) = -q v_\perp(\cos \omega_c t) \Big[ B_0 \pm r_L(\cos\omega_c t )\frac{\partial B}{\partial y} \Big]
\]

where we have made a Taylor expansion of \(\mathbf{B}\) field about the
point \(x_0=0, y_0=0\)

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{B} &= \mathbf{B}_0 + (\mathbf{r}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B} + ... \\
Bz &= B_0 + y(\partial B_z/\partial y) + ...
\end{aligned}
\]

This expansion of course requires \(r_L / L \ll 1\), where L is the
length scale of \(\partial Bz/\partial y\). The first term above
averages to zero in a gyration, and the average of \(\cos^2 \omega_c t\)
is \(1/2\), so that

\[
\bar{F}_y = \mp q v_\perp r_L \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial B}{\partial y}
\]

The guiding center drift velocity is then

\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\bar{F}_y}{|B|}\widehat{x} = \mp \frac{v_\perp r_L}{B}\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial B}{\partial y} \widehat{x}
\]

where we have used the formula shown previously. Since the choice of the
y axis was arbitrary, this can be generalized to

\[
\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \pm v_\perp r_L \frac{\mathbf{B}\times \nabla B}{B^2}
\]

This has all the dependences we expected from the physical picture; only
the factor \(\frac{1}{2}\) (arising from the averaging) was not
predicted. Note that the \(\pm\) stands for the sign of the charge, and
lightface \(B\) stands for \(|B|\). The quantity
\(\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B}\) is called the \emph{grad-B drift}; it is in
opposite directions for ions and electrons and causes a current
transverse to \(\mathbf{B}\). An exact calculation of
\(\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B}\) would require using the exact orbit, including
the drift, in the averaging process.

\hypertarget{curved-b-curvature-drift}{%
\subsection{Curved B: Curvature Drift}\label{curved-b-curvature-drift}}

Here we assume the magnetic field lines to be curved with a constant
radius of curvature \(R_c\), and we take \(|B|\) to be constant. Such a
field does not obey Maxwell's equations in a vacuum, so in practice the
grad-B drift will always be added to the effect derived here. A guiding
center drift arises from the centrifugal force felt by the particles as
they move along the field lines in their thermal motion. If
\(v_\parallel^2\) denotes the average square of the component of random
velocity along \(\mathbf{B}\), and \(\mathbf{R}_c\) denotes the radius
of curvature vector from the center to the curve, the average
centrifugal force is

\[
\mathbf{F}_{cf} = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{R_c}\widehat{r} = mv_\parallel^2\frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}
\]

According to the guiding center drift formula, this gives rise to a
drift

\[
\mathbf{v}_{R} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\mathbf{F}_{cf}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{qB^2}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2}
\]

The drift \(\mathbf{v}_R\) is called the \emph{curvature drift}.

We must now compute the grad-B drift which accompanies this when the
decrease of \(|B|\) with radius is taken into account. In a vacuum, we
have \(\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = 0\). In the cylindrical coordinates,
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}\) only has a \(z\) component, since
\(\mathbf{B}\) has only a \(\theta\) component and \(\nabla B\) only an
\(r\) component. We then have

\[
(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})_z = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(rB_\theta) = 0,\, B\propto \frac{1}{r}
\]

Thus

\[
|B| \propto \frac{1}{R_c},\, \frac{\nabla B}{B} = - \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}
\]

Using the expression of the grad-B drift, we have

\[
\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \mp \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_\perp r_L}{B^2}\frac{B}\times |B| \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = \pm \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{q}v_\perp^2\frac{\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]

Adding this to \(\mathbf{v}_R\) , we have the total drift in a curved
vacuum field:

\[
\mathbf{v}_R + \mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \frac{m}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}\Big( v_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}v_\perp^2 \Big)
\]

It is unfortunate that these drifts add. This means that if one bends a
magnetic field into a torus for the purpose of confining a thermonuclear
plasma, the particles will drift out of the torus no matter how one
juggles the temperatures and magnetic fields.

For a Maxwellian distribution, \(\bar{v_\parallel^2}\) and
\(\frac{1}{2}\bar{v_\perp^2}\) are each equal to \(k_B T/m\), since
\(v_\perp\) involves two degrees of freedom. Then the average
curved-field drift can be written as

\[
\bar{\mathbf{v}}_{R+\nabla B} = \pm \frac{v_{th}^2}{R_c\omega_c}\widehat{y} = \pm\frac{\bar{r}_L}{R_c}v_{th}\widehat{y}
\]

where \(\widehat{y}\) here is the direction of
\(\widehat{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}\). This shows that
\(\bar{\mathbf{v}}_{R+\nabla B}\) depends on the charge of the species
but not on its mass.

\hypertarget{b-b-magnetic-mirrors}{%
\subsection{∇B ∥ B: Magnetic Mirrors}\label{b-b-magnetic-mirrors}}

Now we consider a magnetic field which is pointed primarily in the z
direction and whose magnitude varies in the z direction. Let the field
be axisymmetric, with \(B_\theta = 0\) and
\(\partial/\partial\theta = 0\). Since the magnetic field lines converge
and diverge, there is necessarily a component \(B_r\). We wish to show
that this gives rise to a force which can trap a particle in a magnetic
field.

We can obtain \(B_r\) from \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} = 0\):

\[
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(rB_r) + \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z} = 0
\]

If \(\partial \mathbf{B}_z/\partial z\) is given at \(r=0\) and does not
vary much with r, we have approximately

\[
\begin{aligned}
rB_r &= -\int_0^r r\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}dr \simeq -\frac{1}{2}r^2 \Big[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}_z}{\partial z} \Big]_{r=0} \\
B_r &= -\frac{1}{2}r \Big[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}_z}{\partial z} \Big]_{r=0}
\end{aligned}
\]

The variation of \(|B|\) with r causes a grad-B drift of guiding centers
about the axis of symmetry, but there is no radial grad-B drift, because
\(\partial B/\partial \theta = 0\). The components of the Lorentz force
are

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_r &= q(\underbrace{v_\theta B_z}_{\small{1}} - v_z \cancel{B_\theta}) \\
F_\theta &= q(\underbrace{-v_r B_z}_{\small{2}} + \underbrace{v_z B_r}_{\small{3}}) \\
F_z &= q(v_r \cancel{B}_\theta - \underbrace{v_\theta B_r}_{\small{4}})
\end{aligned}
\]

Two terms vanish if \(B_\theta = 0\), and terms 1 and 2 give rise to the
usual Larmor gyration. Term 3 vanishes on the axis; when it does not
vanish, this azimuthal force causes a drift in the radial direction.
This drift merely makes the guiding centers follow the magnetic field
lines. Term 4 is the one we are interested in. Using the expression of
\(B_r\), we have

\[
F_z = \frac{1}{2}q v_\theta r_L \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
\]

We must now average over one gyration. For simplicity, consider a
particle whose guiding center lies on the axis. Then \(v_\theta\) is a
constant during a gyration; depending on the sign of q, \(v_\theta\) is
\(\mp v_\perp\). Since \(r = r_L\) , the average force is

\[
\bar{F}_z = \mp \frac{1}{2}q v_\perp r_L \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z} = \mp \frac{1}{2}q\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c} \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{mv_\perp^2}{B} \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
\]

We define the \emph{magnetic moment} of the gyrating particle to be

\[
\mu \equiv \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2 / B
\]

so that

\[
\bar{F}_z = -\mu \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
\]

This is a specific example of the force on a diamagnetic particle, which
in general can be written

\[
\mathbf{F}_\parallel = -\mu\frac{\partial B}{\partial \mathbf{s}} = -\mu\nabla_\parallel B
\]

where \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}\) is a line element along \(\mathbf{B}\).
Note that the definition of magnetic moment here is the same as the
usual definition for the magnetic moment of a current loop with area A
and current I: \(\mu = IA\). In the case of a singly charged ion, I is
generated by a charge e coming around \(\omega_c / 2\pi\) times a
second: \(I = e\omega_c/2\pi\). The area A is
\(\pi r_L^2 = \pi r_L^2/\omega_c^2\). Thus

\[
\mu = \frac{e\omega_c}{2\pi}\frac{\pi r_L^2}{\omega_c^2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_\perp^2 e}{\omega_c} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{mv_\perp^2}{B}
\]

As the particle moves into regions of stronger or weaker B, its Larmor
radius changes, but \emph{μ remains invariant}. To prove this, consider
the component of the equation of motion along \(\mathbf{B}\):

\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}v_\parallel}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\mu \frac{\partial B}{\partial s}
\]

Multiplying by \(v_\parallel\) on the left and its equivalent
\(ds/\mathrm{d}t\) on the right, we have

\[
mv_\parallel \frac{\mathrm{d}v_\parallel}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 \Big) = -\mu\frac{\partial B}{\partial s}\frac{ds}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

Here \(\mathrm{d}B/\mathrm{d}t\) is the variation of \(B\) as seen by
the particle; \(B\) itself is constant. The particle's energy must be
conserved, so we have

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2 \Big) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \mu B \Big) = 0
\]

With the previous equation this becomes

\[
-\mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\mu B) = 0
\]

so that

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mu}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0
\]

The invariance of \(\mu\) is the basis for one of the primary schemes
for plasma confinement: the \emph{magnetic mirror}. As a particle moves
from a weak-field region to a strong-field region in the course of its
thermal motion, it sees an increasing B, and therefore its \(v_\perp\)
must increase in order to keep μ constant. Since its total energy must
remain constant, \(v_\parallel\) must necessarily decrease. If B is high
enough in the ``throat'' of the mirror, \(v_\parallel\) eventually
becomes zero; and the particle is ``reflected'' back to the weak-field
region. It is, of course, the force \(\mathbf{F}_\parallel\) which
causes the reflection. The nonuniform field of a simple pair of coil
form two magnetic mirrors between which a plasma can be trapped. This
effect works on both ions and electrons.

The trapping is not perfect, however. For instance, a particle with
\(v_\perp = 0\) will have no magnetic moment and will not feel any force
along \(\mathbf{B}\). A particle with small \(v_\perp / v_\parallel\) at
the midplane (\(B = B_0\)) will also escape if the maximum field \(B_m\)
is not large enough. For given \(B_0\) and \(B_m\), which particles will
escape? A particle with \(v_\perp = v_{\perp 0}\) and
\(v_\parallel = v_{\parallel 0}\) at the midplane will have
\(v_\perp = v_\perp^\prime\) and \(v_\parallel = 0\) at its turning
point. Let the field be \(B^\prime\) there. Then the invariants of
\(\mu\) yields

\[
\frac{1}{2}\frac{mv_{\perp 0}^2}{B_0} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m{v_{\perp 0}^{\prime}}^2}{B^\prime}
\]

Conservation of energy requires

\[
{v_{\perp 0}^{\prime}}^2 = v_{\perp 0}^2 + v_{\parallel 0}^2 \equiv v_0^2
\]

Combining the above two equations, we find

\[
\frac{B_0}{B^\prime} = \frac{v_{\perp 0}^2}{{v_{\perp}^{\prime}}^2} \equiv \sin^2 \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the pitch angle of the orbit in the weak-field
region. Particles with smaller θ will mirror in regions of higher B. If
θ is too small, \(B^\prime\) exceeds \(B_m\); and the particles does not
mirror at all. Replacing \(B^\prime\) by \(B_m\), we see that the
smallest \(\theta\) of a confined particle is given by

\[
\sin^2 \theta_m = \frac{B_0}{B_m} \equiv \frac{1}{R_m}
\]

where \(R_m\) is the \emph{mirror ratio}. It defines the boundary of a
region in velocity space in the shape of a cone, called a \emph{loss
cone}. Particles lying within the loss cone are not confined.
Consequently, a mirror-confined plasma is never isotropic. Note that the
loss cone is independent of q or m. Without collisions, both ions and
electrons are equally well confined. When collisions occur, particles
are lost when they change their pitch angle in a collision and are
scattered into the loss cone. Generally, electrons are lost more easily
because they have a higher collision frequency.

The magnetic mirror was first proposed by Enrico Fermi as a mechanism
for the acceleration of cosmic rays. Protons bouncing between magnetic
mirrors approaching each other at high velocity could gain energy at
each bounce. How such mirrors could arise is another story. A further
example of the mirror effect is the confinement of particles in the Van
Allen belts. The magnetic field of the earth, being strong at the poles
and weak at the equator, forms a natural mirror with rather large
\(R_m\).

\hypertarget{sec:nonuniform_E}{%
\section{Nonuniform E Field}\label{sec:nonuniform_E}}

Now we let the magnetic field be uniform and the electric field be
nonuniform. For simplicity, we assume \(\mathbf{E}\) to be in the x
direction and to vary sinusoidally in the x direction:

\[
\mathbf{E} \equiv E_0 (\cos kx)\widehat{x}
\]

This field distribution has a wavelength \(\lambda = 2\pi / k\), and is
the result of a sinusoidal distribution of charges, which we need not
specify. In practice, such a charge distribution can arise in a plasma
during a wave motion. The equation of motion is

\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = q[\mathbf{E}(x) + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}]
\]

whose transverse components are

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{v}_x &= \frac{qB}{m}v_y + \frac{q}{m}E_x(x) \\
\dot{v}_y &= -\frac{qB}{m}v_x
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &= -\omega_c^2 v_x \pm \omega_c \frac{\dot{E}_x}{B} \\
\ddot{v}_y &= -\omega_c^2 v_y -\omega_c^2\frac{E_x(x)}{B}
\end{aligned}
\]

Here \(E_x(x)\) is the electric field at the position of the particle.
To evaluate this, we need to know the particle's orbit, which we are
trying to solve for in the first place. If the electric field is weak,
we may, as an approximation, use the \emph{undisturbed orbit} to
evaluate \(E_x(x)\). The orbit in the absence of the E field was given
before

\[
x = x_0 + r_L\sin \omega_c t
\]

so we have

\[
\ddot{v}_y = -\omega_c^2 v_y -\omega_c^2\frac{E_0}{B}\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t)
\]

Anticipating the result, we look for a solution which is the sum of a
gyration at \(\omega_c\) and a steady drift \(\mathbf{v}_E\). Since we
are interested in finding an expression for \(v_E\), we take out the
gyratory motion by averaging over a cycle. The \(v_x\) component then
gives \(\bar{v}_x = 0\).\footnote{I am kind of lost here. Probably the
  logic here is that first we assume the solution has an additional
  steady drift, so we let \(\ddot{v}_y = 0\)? Check Y.Y's note.} In the
\(v_y\) component, the oscillating term \(\ddot{v}_y\) clearly averages
to zero, and we have

\[
\bar{\ddot{v}_y} = 0 = -\omega_c^2 \bar{v}_y -\omega_c^2\frac{E_0}{B}\bar{\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t)}
\]

Expanding the cosine, we have

\[
\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t) = \cos(kx_0) \cos(kr_L \sin\omega_c t) - \sin(kx_0) \sin(kr_L \sin\omega_c t)
\]

It will suffice to treat the small Larmor radius case, \(kr_L \ll 1\).
The Taylor expansions allow us to write

\[
\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t) \approx \cos(kx_0)\big( 1 - \frac{1}{2}k^2r_L^2 \sin^2\omega_c t \big) - \sin(kx_0)k r_L \sin\omega_c t
\]

The last term vanishes upon averaging over time, and it gives

\[
\bar{v}_y = -\frac{E_0}{B}\cos(kx_0)\big( 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \big) = -\frac{E_x(x_0)}{B}\big( 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \big)
\]

Thus the usual \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift is modified by the
inhomogeneity to read

\[
\mathbf{v}_E = \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\big( 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \big)
\]

The physical reason for this is easy to see. An ion with its guiding
center at a maximum of \(\mathbf{E}\) actually spends a good deal of its
time in regions of weaker \(\mathbf{E}\). Its average drift, therefore,
is less than E/B evaluated at the guiding center. In a linearly varying
\(\mathbf{E}\) field, the ion would be in a stronger field on one side
of the orbit and in a field weaker by the same amount on the other side;
the correction to \(\mathbf{v}_E\) then cancels out. From this it is
clear that the correction term depends on the \emph{second derivative}
of \(\mathbf{E}\). For the sinusoidal distribution we assumed, the
second derivative is always negative with respect to \(\mathbf{E}\). For
an arbitrary variation of \(\mathbf{E}\), we need only replace \(ik\) by
\(\nabla\) and write the drift as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:vE}{}{
\mathbf{v}_E = \Big( 1 + \frac{1}{4}r_L^2\nabla^2 \Big) \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
}\label{eq:vE}\end{equation}

The second term is called the \emph{finite-Larmor-radius effect}. What
is the significance of this correction? Since \(r_L\) is much larger for
ions than for electrons, \(\mathbf{v}_E\) is no longer independent of
species. If a density clump occurs in a plasma, an electric field can
cause the ions and electrons to separate, generating another electric
field. If there is a feedback mechanism that causes the second electric
field to enhance the first one, \(\mathbf{E}\) grows indefinitely, and
the plasma is unstable. Such an instability, called a \emph{drift
instability}, is one type of plasma instabilities. The grad-B drift, of
course, is also a finite-Larmor-radius effect and also causes charges to
separate. However, \(\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} \propto kr_L\) whereas the
correction term above is proportional to \(k^2 r_L^2\). The
nonuniform-E-field effect, therefore, is important at relatively large
k, or small scale lengths of the inhomogeneity. For this reason, drift
instabilities belong to a more general class called
\emph{microinstabilities}.

\hypertarget{sec:time-varying_E}{%
\section{Time-Varying E Field}\label{sec:time-varying_E}}

Let us now take \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) to be uniform in space
but varying in time. First, consider the case in which \(\mathbf{E}\)
alone varies sinusoidally in time, and let it lie along the x axis:

\[
\mathbf{E} = E_0 e^{i\omega t}\widehat{x}
\]

Since \(\dot{E}_x = i\omega E_x\), we can write the velocity x-component
equation as

\[
\ddot{v}_x = -\omega_c^2 \Big( v_x \mp \frac{i\omega}{\omega_c}\frac{\tilde{E}_x}{B} \Big)
\]

Let us define

\[
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{v}_p &\equiv \pm \frac{i\omega}{\omega_c}\frac{\tilde{E}_x}{B} \\
\tilde{v}_E &\equiv \frac{\tilde{E}_x}{B}
\end{aligned}
\]

where the tilde has been added merely to emphasize that the drift is
oscillating. The plus (minus) sign, as usual, denotes positive
(negative) \(q\). Now the x and y velocity component equations can be
written as

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &= -\omega_c^2(v_x - \tilde{v}_p) \\
\ddot{v}_y &= -\omega_c^2(v_y - \tilde{v}_E)
\end{aligned}
\]

By analogy with the derivation in the case of a uniform EM field, we try
a solution which is the sum of a drift and a gyratory motion:

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_x &= v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} + \tilde{v}_p \\
v_y &= \pm i v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} + \tilde{v}_E
\end{aligned}
\]

If we now differentiate twice with respect to time, we find

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &= -\omega_c^2 v_x + (\omega_c^2 - \omega^2)\tilde{v}_p \\
\ddot{v}_y &= -\omega_c^2 v_y + (\omega_c^2 - \omega^2)\tilde{v}_E
\end{aligned}
\]

This is \textbf{not} the same as the previous expressions right above
unless \(\omega^2 \ll \omega_c^2\). If we now make the assumption that
\(\mathbf{E}\) varies slowly, so that \(\omega^2 \ll \omega_c^2\), then
there we have the approximate solution.

The solution of velocities in x and y tells us that the guiding center
motion has two components. The y component, perpendicular to
\(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\), is the usual
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift, except that \(v_E\) now oscillates
slowly at the frequency \(\omega\). The x component, a new drift
\emph{along the direction of} \(\mathbf{E}\), is called the
\emph{polarization drift}. By replacing \(i\omega\) with
\(\partial/\partial t\), we can generalize the expression of \(v_p\) and
define the polarization drift as

\[
\mathbf{v}_p = \pm \frac{1}{\omega_c B}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

Since \(\mathbf{v}_p\) is in opposite directions for ions and electrons,
there is a \emph{polarization current}; for Z = 1, this is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:polarization_current}{}{
\mathbf{j}_p = ne(v_{ip} - v_{ep}) = \frac{ne}{eB^2}(M+m)\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\rho}{B^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t}
}\label{eq:polarization_current}\end{equation}

where \(\rho\) is the mass density.

The physical reason for the polarization current is simple. Consider an
ion at rest in a magnetic field. If a field \(\mathbf{E}\) is suddenly
applied, the first thing the ion does is to move in the direction of
\(\mathbf{E}\). Only after picking up a velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) does the
ion feel a Lorentz force \(e\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\) and begin to
move perpendicular to both fields. If \(\mathbf{E}\) is now kept
constant, there is no further \(\mathbf{v}_p\) drift but only a
\(\mathbf{v}_E\) drift. However, if \(\mathbf{E}\) is reversed, there is
again a momentary drift, this time to the left. Thus \(\mathbf{v}_p\) is
a startup drift due to inertia and occurs only in the first half-cycle
of each gyration during which \(\mathbf{E}\) changes. Consequently,
\(\mathbf{v}_p\) goes to zero when \(\omega/\omega_c \ll 1\).

The polarization effect in a plasma is similar to that in a solid
dielectric, where \(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}\).
The dipoles in a plasma are ions and electrons separated by a distance
\(r_L\). But since ions and electrons can move around to preserve
quasineutrality, the application of a steady \(\mathbf{E}\) field does
not result in a polarization field \(\mathbf{P}\). However, if
\(\mathbf{E}\) oscillates, an oscillating current \(\mathbf{j}_p\)
results from the lag due to the ion inertia.

It is obvious that in this case the \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift
speed depends on time and the guiding center coordinate system is
non-inertial. The polarization drift arises from the fictuous (inertial)
force \(-m \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_E/\mathrm{d}t\). It means that the
guiding center locations will not change due to the polarization drift!

Let us demonstrate this in a single configuration. Assume
\(\mathbf{B}=B\hat{z}\), \(\mathbf{E}=Et\hat{y}\). Let \(\theta\) be the
angle in the perpendicular plane:

\[
\mathbf{v}_\perp = v_\perp\hat{e}_\perp = v_\perp(\cos\theta\hat{x}+\sin\theta\hat{y})
\]

The guiding center is defined as

\[
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{r}_L = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{v}_\perp / \omega_c = \mathbf{x} - \frac{v_\perp}{\omega_c}\hat{\theta}
\]

where \(\hat{\theta} = \mathbf{b}\times\hat{e}_\perp\). The equation of
motion

\[
\begin{aligned}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= q(\mathbf{E} +\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}) \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \mathbf{v}
\end{aligned}
\]

in the guiding center coordinates the two selected scalar equations can
be written as

\[
\begin{aligned}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}v_x}{\mathrm{d}t} &= qE_x + qv_yB \\
\frac{dX_y}{\mathrm{d}t} &= v_y - \frac{1}{\omega_c}\frac{\mathrm{d}v_x}{\mathrm{d}t}
\end{aligned}
\]

such that

\[
\frac{dX_y}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0
\]

\hypertarget{time-varying-b-field}{%
\section{Time-Varying B Field}\label{time-varying-b-field}}

Finally, we allow the magnetic field to vary in time. Since the Lorentz
force is always perpendicular to \(\mathbf{v}\), a magnetic field itself
cannot impart energy to a charged particle. However, associated with
\(\mathbf{B}\) is an electric field given by

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\dot{\mathbf{B}}
\]

and this can accelerate the particles. We can no longer assume the
fields to be completely uniform. Let
\(\mathbf{v}_\perp = \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}/\mathrm{d}t\) be the
transverse velocity, \(\mathbf{l}\) being the element of the path along
a particle trajectory (with \(v_\parallel\) neglected). Taking the
scalar product of the equation of motion with \(\mathbf{v}_\perp\), we
have

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2 \Big) = q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{v}_\perp = q\mathbf{E}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

The change in one gyration is obtained by integrating over one period:

\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \int_0^{2\pi/\omega_c}q\mathbf{E}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t
\]

If the field changes slowly, we can replace the time integral by a line
integral over the unperturbed orbit:

\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \oint q\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} = q\int_s (\nabla\times\mathbf{E})\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = -q \int_s\dot{\mathbf{B}}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
\]

Here \(\mathbf{S}\) is the surface enclosed by the Larmor orbit and has
a direction given by the right-hand rule when the fingers point in the
direction of \(\mathbf{v}\). Since the plasma is diamagnetic, we have
\(\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}<0\) for ions and
\(\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}>0\) for electrons. Then

\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \pm q \dot{B}\pi r_L^2 = \pm q \pi\dot{B}]frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c}\frac{m}{\pm qB} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2}{B}\cdot \frac{2\pi \dot{B}}{\omega_c}
\]

The quantity \(\frac{2\pi\dot{B}}{\omega_c} = \frac{\dot{B}}{\omega_c}\)
is just the change \(\delta B\) during one period of gyration. Thus

\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \mu \delta B
\]

Since the left-hand-side is \(\delta(\mu B)\), we have the desired
result

\[
\delta \mu = 0
\]

\emph{The magnetic moment is invariant in slowly varying magnetic
fields.}

As the B field varies in strength, the Larmor orbits expand and
contract, and the particles lose and gain transverse energy. This
exchange of energy between the particles and the field is described very
simply by the invariant of magnetic moment. The invariance of \(\mu\)
allows us to prove easily the following well-known theorem: \emph{The
magnetic flux through a Larmor orbit is constant}.

The flux \(\Phi\) is given by \(BS\), with \(S = \pi r_L^2\). Thus

\[
\Phi = B\pi\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c^2} = B\pi\frac{v_\perp^2 m^2}{q^2 B^2} = \frac{2\pi m}{q^2}\frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2}{B} = \frac{2\pi m}{q^2}\mu
\]

Therefore, \(\Phi\) is constant if \(\mu\) is constant.

This property is used in a method of plasma heating known as
\emph{adiabatic compression}. A plasma is injected into a sequence of
magnetic mirrors and by keep increasing the magnetic field in subsequent
mirrors we can increase the plasma velocities.

\mathbf{v}_E = \Big( 1+\frac{1}{4}r_L^2 \nabla^2 \Big)\frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]

Nonuniform magnetic field:

Grad-B:

\[
\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \pm \frac{1}{2}v_\perp r_L\frac{\mathbf{B}\times\nabla B}{B^2}
\]

Curvature drift:

\[
\mathbf{v}_R = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]

Curved vacuum field:

\[
\mathbf{v}_R + \mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \frac{m}{q}\Big( v_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}v_\perp^2 \Big) \frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]

Polarization drift:

\[
\mathbf{v}_p = \pm \frac{1}{\omega_c B}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

A non-relativistic equation for the guiding center is given by Northrop
in 1963:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}t} = v_\parallel\hat{b} + \frac{\hat{b}}{B}\times \Big[ -\mathbf{E} + \frac{m}{q}\Big( v_\parallel\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{b}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_{E\times B}}{\mathrm{d}t} \Big) + \frac{\mu}{q}\nabla B \Big]
\]

and the parallel motion can be described by (???)

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}(mv_\parallel)}{\mathrm{d}t} = m\mathbf{u}_q E_\parallel - \mu\hat{b}\cdot\nabla B
\]

By applying the guiding center approximation, we reduce the number of
independent variables from 6 \((x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z)\) to 5
\((x,y,z,v_\perp, v_\parallel)\).

\hypertarget{adiabatic-invariants}{%
\section{Adiabatic Invariants}\label{adiabatic-invariants}}

It is well known in classical mechanics that whenever a system has a
periodic motion, the action integral \(\oint p dq\) taken over a period
is a constant of the motion. Here \(p\) and \(q\) are the generalized
momentum and coordinate which repeat themselves in the motion. If a slow
change is made in the system, so that the motion is not quite periodic,
the constant of the motion does not change and is then called an
\emph{adiabatic invariant}. By slow here we mean slow compared with the
period of motion, so that the integral \(\oint p dq\) is well defined
even though it is strictly no longer an integral over a closed path.
Adiabatic invariants play an important role in plasma physics; they
allow us to obtain simple answers in many instances involving
complicated motions. There are three adiabatic invariants, each
corresponding to a different type of periodic motion.

\hypertarget{the-first-adiabatic-invariant}{%
\subsection{The First Adiabatic
Invariant}\label{the-first-adiabatic-invariant}}

We have already met the quantity

\[
\mu = mv_\perp^2 / 2B
\]

and have proved its invariance in spatially and temporally varying
\(\mathbf{B}\) fields. The periodic motion involved, of course, is the
Larmor gyration. If we take \(p\) to be angular momentum \(mv_\perp r\)
and \(dq\) to be the coordinate \(\mathrm{d}\theta\), the action
integral becomes

\[
\oint p dq = \oint mv_\perp r \mathrm{d}\theta = 2\pi r_L m v_\perp = 2\pi \frac{mv_\perp^2}{\omega_c} = 4\pi \frac{m}{|q|}\mu
\]

Thus μ is a constant of the motion as long as \(q/m\) is not changed. We
have proved the invariance of μ only with the implicit assumption
\(\omega/\omega_c \ll 1\), where \(\omega\) is a frequency
characterizing the rate of change of \(\mathbf{B}\) as seen by the
particle. A proof exists, however, that μ is invariant even when
\(\omega/\omega_c \le q\). In theorists' language, μ is invariant ``to
all orders in an expansion in ω/ω c .'' What this means in practice is
that μ remains much more nearly constant than \(\mathbf{B}\) does during
one period of gyration.

It is just as important to know when an adiabatic invariant does
\emph{not} exist as to know when it does. Adiabatic invariance of μ is
violated when ω is not small compared with \(\omega_c\) . We give three
examples of this.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Magnetic Pumping}. If the strength of \(\mathbf{B}\) in a mirror
  confinement system is varied sinusoidally, the particles' \(v_\perp\)
  would oscillate; but there would be no gain of energy in the long run.
  However, if the particles make collisions, the invariance of μ is
  violated, and the plasma can be heated. In particular, a particle
  making a collision during the compression phase can transfer part of
  its gyration energy into \(v_\parallel\) energy, and this is not taken
  out again in the expansion phase.
\item
  \emph{Cyclotron Heating}. Now imagine that the \(\mathbf{B}\) field is
  oscillated at the frequency \(\omega_c\). The induced electric field
  will then rotate in phase with some of the particles and accelerate
  their Larmor motion continuously. The condition \(\omega\ll \omega_c\)
  is violated, μ is not conserved, and the plasma can be heated.
\item
  \emph{Magnetic Cusps}. If the current in one of the coils in a simple
  magnetic mirror system is reversed, a magnetic cusp is formed. This
  configuration has, in addition to the usual mirrors, a spindle-cusp
  mirror extending over \(360^o\) in azimuth. A plasma confined in a
  cusp device is supposed to have better stability properties than that
  in an ordinary mirror. Unfortunately, the loss-cone losses are larger
  because of the additional loss region; and the particle motion is
  nonadiabatic. Since the \(\mathbf{B}\) field vanishes at the center of
  symmetry, \(\omega_c\) is zero there; and μ is not preserved. The
  local Larmor radius near the center is larger than the device. Because
  of this, the adiabatic invariant μ does not guarantee that particles
  outside a loss cone will stay outside after passing through the
  nonadiabatic region. Fortunately, there is in this case another
  invariant: the canonical angular momentum
  \(p_\theta = mrv_\theta - erA_\theta\). This ensures that there will
  be a population of particles trapped indefinitely until they make a
  collision.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-second-adiabatic-invariant}{%
\subsection{The Second Adiabatic
Invariant}\label{the-second-adiabatic-invariant}}

Consider a particle trapped between two magnetic mirrors: it bounces
between them and therefore has a periodic motion at the ``bounce
frequency''. A constant of this motion is given by
\(\oint mv_\parallel ds\), where \(ds\) is an element of path length (of
the guiding center) along a field line. However, since the guiding
center drifts across field lines, the motion is not exactly periodic,
and the constant of the motion becomes an adiabatic invariant. This is
called the \emph{longitudinal invariant} \(J\) and is defined for a
half-cycle between the two turning points

\[
J = \int_a^b v_\parallel ds
\]

We shall prove that \(J\) is invariant in a static, nonuniform B field;
the result is also true for a slowly time-varying B field.

Before embarking on this somewhat lengthy proof, let us consider an
example of the type of problem in which a theorem on the invariance of
\(J\) would be useful. As we have already seen, the earth's magnetic
field mirror-traps charged particles, which slowly drift in longitude
around the earth. If the magnetic field were perfectly symmetric, the
particle would eventually drift back to the same magnetic field line.
However, the actual field is distorted by such effects as the solar
wind. In that case, will a particle ever come back to the same magnetic
field line? Since the particle's energy is conserved and is equal to
\(\frac{1}{2} mv_\perp^2\) at the turning point, the invariance of μ
indicates that \(|B|\) remains the same at the turning point. However,
upon drifting back to the same longitude, a particle may find itself on
another magnetic field line at a different altitude. This cannot happen
if \(J\) is conserved. \(J\) determines the length of the field lines
between turning points, and no two lines have the same length between
points with the same \(|B|\). Consequently, the particle returns to the
same magnetic field line even in a slightly asymmetric field.

To prove the invariance of \(J\), we first consider the invariance of
\(v_\parallel \delta s\), where \(\delta s\) is a segment of the path
along \(\mathbf{B}\). Because of guiding center drifts, a particle on
\(s\) will find itself on another magnetic field line
\(\delta s^\prime\) after a time \(\Delta t\). The length of
\(\delta s^\prime\) is defined by passing planes perpendicular to
\(\mathbf{B}\) through the end points of \(\delta s\). The length of
\(\delta s\) is obviously proportional to the radius of curvature:

\[
\frac{\delta s}{R_c} = \frac{\delta s^\prime}{R_c^\prime}
\]

so that

\[
\frac{\delta s^\prime - \delta s}{\Delta t \delta s} = \frac{R_c^\prime - R_c}{\Delta t R_c}
\]

The ``radial'' component of \(\mathbf{v}_{gc}\) is just

\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc}\cdot \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c} = \frac{R_c^\prime - R_c}{\Delta t}
\]

The guiding center drift in curved vacuum field is

\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \mathbf{v}_R + \mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \pm \frac{1}{2}v_\perp r_L\frac{\mathbf{B}\times\nabla B}{B^2} + \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]

The curvature drift has no component along \(\mathbf{R}_c\). Using the
above three equations, we have

\[
\frac{1}{\delta s}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\delta s = \mathbf{v}_{gs} \cdot \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{q}\frac{v_\perp^2}{B^3}(\mathbf{B}\times\nabla B)\cdot\frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}
\]

This is the rate of change of \(\delta s\) as seen by the particle. We
must now get the rate of change of \(v_\parallel\) as seen by the
particle. The parallel and perpendicular energies are defined by

\[
W \equiv \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \mu B \equiv W_\parallel + W_\perp
\]

Thus \(v_\parallel\) can be written

\[
v_\parallel = \left[ \frac{2}{m}(W - \mu B) \right]^{1/2}
\]

Here W and μ are constant, and only B varies. Therefore,

\[
\frac{\dot{v}_\parallel}{v_\parallel} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mu\dot{B}}{W - \mu B} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mu \dot{B}}{W_\parallel} = -\frac{\mu\dot{B}}{mv_\parallel^2}
\]

Since B was assumed static, \(\dot{B}\) is not zero only because of the
guiding center motion:

\[
\dot{B} = \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{v}_{gc}\cdot\nabla B = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2} \cdot\nabla B
\]

Now we have

\[
\frac{\dot{v}_\parallel}{v_\parallel} = -\frac{\mu}{q}\frac{(\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B})\cdot\nabla B}{R_c^2 B^2} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{q}\frac{v_\perp^2}{B} \frac{(\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B})\cdot\nabla B}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]

The fractional change in \(v_\parallel \delta s\) is

\[
\frac{1}{v_\parallel \delta s}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(v_\parallel \delta s) = \frac{1}{\delta s}\frac{\mathrm{d}\delta s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{1}{v_\parallel}\frac{\mathrm{d}v_\parallel}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

From the previous derivations we see that the these two terms cancel, so
that

\[
v_\parallel \delta s = \textrm{constant}
\]

This is not exactly the same as saying that \(J\) is constant, however.
In taking the integral of \(v_\parallel \delta s\), between the turning
points, it may be that the turning points on \(\delta s^\prime\) do not
coincide with the intersections of the perpendicular planes. However,
any error in \(J\) arising from such a discrepancy is negligible because
near the turning points, \(v_\parallel\) is nearly zero. Consequently,
we have proved

\[
J = \int_a^b v_\parallel ds = \textrm{constant}
\]

An example of the violation of J invariance is given by a plasma heating
scheme called \emph{transit-time magnetic pumping}. Suppose an
oscillating current is applied to the coils of a mirror system so that
the mirrors alternately approach and withdraw from each other near the
bounce frequency. Those particles that have the right bounce frequency
will always see an approaching mirror and will therefore gain
\(v_\parallel\). \(J\) is not conserved in this case because the change
of \(\mathbf{B}\) occurs on a time scale not long compared with the
bounce time.

\hypertarget{the-third-adiabatic-invariant}{%
\subsection{The Third Adiabatic
Invariant}\label{the-third-adiabatic-invariant}}

Referring again to the earth dipole case, we see that the slow drift of
a guiding center around the earth constitutes a third type of periodic
motion. The adiabatic invariant connected with this turns out to be the
total magnetic flux \(\Phi\) enclosed by the drift surface.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:magnetic_flux}{}{
\Phi = \int\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
}\label{eq:magnetic_flux}\end{equation}

It is almost obvious that, as \(\mathbf{B}\) varies, the particle will
stay on a surface such that the total number of magnetic field lines
enclosed remains constant. This invariant, \(\Phi\), has few
applications because most fluctuations of \(\mathbf{B}\) occur on a time
scale short compared with the drift period. As an example of the
violation of \(\Phi\) invariance, we can cite some recent work on the
excitation of ultra-low frequency magnetohydrodynamic waves in the
ionosphere. These waves have a long period comparable to the drift time
of a particle around the earth. The particles can therefore encounter
the wave in the same phase each time around. If the phase is right, the
wave can be excited by the conversion of particle drift energy to wave
energy.

Here are some time scales to remember for a 1 MeV proton in the Earth's
radiation belt. The drift period is about 16 mins, the bounce period is
about 0.22 s, and the gyroperiod is about 0.22 ms. These numbers are
from Solène Lejosne's
\href{https://solenelejosne.com/bounce/}{calculator}.

In radiation belt studies, it is typical to consider a quantity that is
inversely proportional to the magnetic flux:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:Lstar}{}{
L^\ast = \frac{2\pi M}{|\phi|R_E} = \frac{2\pi B_{eq}R_E^2}{|\phi|}
}\label{eq:Lstar}\end{equation}

where \(M\) is the magnetic moment of the Earth's dipole field, \(R_E\)
is the radius of the Earth, and \(B_{eq}\) is the magnetic field
strength at the equatorial surface. This presentation of the third
invariant is termed \(L^\ast\), or Roederer's \(L\) parameter, which is
the radial distance to the equatorial point where the particle would be
found if all nondipolar perturbations in the geomagnetic field were
adiabatically turned off leaving only the dipole field (Roederer, 1970).
It should be noted that in a nondipolar field \(L^\ast\) does \emph{not}
represent a spatial coordinate, instead \(L^\ast\) is a property of a
stably trapped particle (Roederer and Lejosne, 2018). That is, in
absence of acceleration or loss processes, \(L^\ast\) defines a surface
with constant phase space density. If a particle encounter a boundary of
the radiation belt system (i.e.~the magnetopause or atmosphere) during
its drift leading to its loss from the system, the particle does not
have an \(L^\ast\) value. The particle is said to be in the drift loss
cone.

Therefore, the \(L\) and \(L^\ast\) parameters coincide in a dipole
field, but in a nondipolar field, these parameters are different.
Typically, \(L\) is used with particle fluxes whereas \(L^\ast\) is
better suited for phase space density.

\hypertarget{ring-current}{%
\section{Ring Current}\label{ring-current}}

One typical application of the single particle motion is the study of
ring current. Beyond the lowest order of motion (i.e.~gyration combined
with parallel drift) of charged particles in the magnetosphere, let us
examine the higher order corrections. For the case of non-time-varying
fields, and a weak electric field, these corrections consist of a
combination of \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift, grad-\(B\) drift,
and curvature drift:

\[
\mathbf{v}_{1\perp} = \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} + \frac{\mu}{m\Omega}\hat{b}\times\nabla B + \frac{v_\parallel^2}{\Omega}\hat{b}\times(\hat{b}\cdot\nabla)\hat{b}
\]

Let us neglect \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift, since this motion
merely gives rise to the convection of plasma within the magnetosphere,
without generating a current. By contrast, there is a net current
associated with grad-\(B\) drift and curvature drift. In the limit in
which this current does not strongly modify the ambient magnetic field
(i.e., \(\nabla\times\mathbf{B} \simeq {\bf0}\)), which is certainly the
situation in the Earth's magnetosphere, we can write

\[
(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\,\mathbf{B} =-\mathbf{B}\times(\nabla\times \mathbf{B})\simeq \frac{\nabla_\perp B}{B}
\]

It follows that the higher order drifts can be combined to give

\[
\mathbf{v}_{1\perp} = \frac{(v_\perp^{~2}/2+v_\parallel^{~2})}{{\Omega}\,B}\, \mathbf{B}\times\nabla B
\]

For the dipole field Equation~\ref{eq:dipole_spherical}, the above
expression yields

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:high_order_drifts}{}{
\mathbf{v}_{1\perp} \simeq -\mathrm{sgn}({\Omega})\,\frac{6\,\mathcal{E} L^2}{eB_E R_E}(1-B/2B_m)\frac{\cos^5\vartheta(1+\sin^2\vartheta)}{(1+3\sin^2\vartheta)^2}\,\hat{\varphi}
}\label{eq:high_order_drifts}\end{equation}

where \(\mathcal{E}\) is the energy of the particle, \(B_E\) is the
equatorial magnetic field-strength on the Earth's surface, and \(B_m\)
is the magnetic field-strength at the mirror points. Note that the drift
is in the azimuthal direction. A positive drift velocity corresponds to
eastward motion, whereas a negative velocity corresponds to westward
motion. It is clear that, in addition to their gyromotion and periodic
bouncing motion along field lines, charged particles trapped in the
magnetosphere also slowly precess around the Earth. The ions drift
westwards and the electrons drift eastwards, giving rise to a net
westward current circulating around the Earth. This current is known as
the \emph{ring current}.

Although the perturbations to the Earth's magnetic field induced by the
ring current are small, they are still detectable. In fact, the ring
current causes a slight reduction in the Earth's magnetic field in
equatorial regions. The size of this reduction is a good measure of the
number of charged particles contained in the Van Allen belts
(Section~\ref{sec:radiation_belt}). During the development of so-called
geomagnetic storms, charged particles are injected into the Van Allen
belts from the outer magnetosphere, giving rise to a sharp increase in
the ring current, and a corresponding decrease in the Earth's equatorial
magnetic field. These particles eventually precipitate out of the
magnetosphere into the upper atmosphere at high latitudes, giving rise
to intense auroral activity, serious interference in electromagnetic
communications, and, in extreme cases, disruption of electric power
grids. The ring current induced reduction in the Earth's magnetic field
is measured by the so-called \emph{Dst} index, which is based on hourly
averages of the northward horizontal component of the terrestrial
magnetic field recorded at four low-latitude observatories; Honolulu
(Hawaii), San Juan (Puerto Rico), Hermanus (South Africa), and Kakioka
(Japan). A reduction in the Dst index by 600 nT corresponds to a \(2\%\)
reduction in the terrestrial magnetic field at the equator.

According to Equation~\ref{eq:high_order_drifts}, the precessional drift
velocity of charged particles in the magnetosphere is a rapidly
decreasing function of increasing latitude (i.e., most of the ring
current is concentrated in the equatorial plane). Since particles
typically complete many bounce orbits during a full rotation around the
Earth, it is convenient to average Equation~\ref{eq:high_order_drifts}
over a bounce period to obtain the \emph{average} drift velocity. This
averaging can only be performed numerically. The final answer is well
approximated by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:drift_ring_current}{}{
\langle v_d\rangle \simeq \frac{6\,\mathcal{E}\,L^2}{e\,B_E\,R_E} \,(0.35 + 0.15\,\sin\alpha_\mathrm{eq})
}\label{eq:drift_ring_current}\end{equation}

The average drift period (i.e., the time required to perform a complete
rotation around the Earth) is simply

\[
\langle \tau_d\rangle = \frac{2\pi\,L\,R_E}{\langle v_d\rangle}\simeq\frac{\pi e B_E R_E^2}{3\,\mathcal{E}\,L}\,(0.35 + 0.15\,\sin\alpha_\mathrm{eq})^{-1}
\]

Thus, the drift period for protons and electrons is

\[
\langle \tau_d\rangle_p=\langle \tau_d\rangle_e \simeq \frac{1.05}{\mathcal{E}(\text{MeV})L}\,(1+0.43\,\sin\alpha_\mathrm{eq})^{-1}\,\,\,\mathrm{hours}
\]

Note that MeV energy electrons and ions precess around the Earth with
about the same velocity, only in opposite directions, because there is
no explicit mass dependence in Equation~\ref{eq:drift_ring_current}. It
typically takes \(\sim 20\) mins to perform a full rotation. The drift
period only depends weakly on the equatorial pitch angle
\(\alpha_\mathrm{eq}\), as is the case for the bounce period. Somewhat
paradoxically, the drift period is shorter on more distant \(L\)-shells.
Note, of course, that particles only get a chance to complete a full
rotation around the Earth if the inner magnetosphere remains quiescent
on time-scales of order an hour, which is, by no means, always the case.

Note, finally, that, since the rest mass of an electron is \(0.51\) MeV,
most of the above formulae require relativistic correction when applied
to MeV energy electrons. Fortunately, however, there is no such problem
for protons, whose rest mass energy is \(0.94\) GeV.

\hypertarget{particle-acceleration}{%
\section{Particle Acceleration}\label{particle-acceleration}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Fermi acceleration} is the acceleration that charged particles
  undergo when being repeatedly reflected, usually by a magnetic mirror.
  This is sometimes referred to as \emph{diffusive shock acceleration},
  which is actually a subclass of Fermi acceleration. There are two
  types of Fermi acceleration: \emph{first-order Fermi acceleration} (in
  shocks) and \emph{second-order Fermi acceleration} (in the environment
  of moving magnetized gas clouds). In both cases the environment has to
  be collisionless in order for the mechanism to be effective. This is
  because Fermi acceleration only applies to particles with energies
  exceeding the thermal energies, and frequent collisions with
  surrounding particles will cause severe energy loss and as a result no
  acceleration will occur. See more in
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_acceleration}{wiki}.
\item
  \emph{Betatron acceleration} refers to situations in which the
  magnetic field strength increases slowly in time (compared with a
  gyroperiod), so that \(\mu\) remains constant, but the particle
  kinetic energy is not constant due to the presence of electric fields
  (associated with the time-varying magnetic field). Then, the
  perpendicular energy is increased due to constancy of \(\mu\).
\end{itemize}

Particle accelerations are important consequences of magnetic
reconnection and shocks. In magnetic reconnection processes, the energy
is rapidly converted from magnetic field to particles in the forms of
flows, bulk (``thermal'') heating, and high-energy (``nonthermal'')
tails. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ji2022magnetic}{Ji et al., 2022})
describes the current understanding of electron acceleration during
magnetic reconnection in the non-relativistic and relativistic regimes.
First-principles numerical simulations suggest power-law nonthermal
particle populations are more prevalent in systems with low \(\beta\)
and moderate guide (perpendicular to the reconnection plane) magnetic
fields, with acceleration efficiency enhanced in 3D compared to
simplified 2D calculations. Multiple acceleration mechanisms have been
studied. In the localized diffusion region near an X-line without a
guide field, particles may become demagnetized, prone to be directly
accelerated by the reconnection electric field as they undergo so-called
\emph{Speiser} or \emph{meandering orbits}. There is recent laboratory
evidence for electron acceleration by this mechanism in action during
magnetically driven reconnection at low-\(\beta\) using laser-powered
capacitor coils. There is also numerical evidence that a substantial
fraction of dissipated magnetic energy is carried by particles
accelerated by this mechanism when they are demagnetized and escape from
plasmoids in 3D.

Over larger scales when the particles remain magnetized, there are three
basic particle acceleration processes that dominate in collisionless
reconnection: \emph{Fermi acceleration} which takes place as particles
stream along and drift in relaxing curved magnetic field lines,
relatively \emph{localized electric fields} \(E_\parallel\) parallel to
the magnetic field directly accelerate particles, and \emph{betatron
heating} which occurs as particles drift into regions of stronger
magnetic field while conserving the first adiabatic moment
\(\mu=mv_\perp^2/B\). These mechanisms are described by guiding center
equations of motion for the particles, and the energization rate in the
non-relativistic limit is given approximately by the following equation:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:particle_energization_nonrelativistic}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{E}}{dt} = qE_\parallel v_\parallel + \mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} + q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{u}_c + \frac{1}{2}m\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}|\mathbf{u}_E|^2
}\label{eq:particle_energization_nonrelativistic}\end{equation}

where \({cal E}\) is the energy of a particle, \(\mathbf{u}_E\) is the
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift velocity,
\(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}_E\cdot\nabla\),
\(E_\parallel\) is the parallel electric field, and \(v_\parallel\) is
the drift-corrected guiding center parallel velocity. For slowly varying
fields, \(\mathbf{u}_c\) is the curvature drift of particles and reduces
to \(\mathbf{u}_c \sim(mv_\parallel^2/qB)(\hat{b}\times\pmb{\kappa})\),
where \(\pmb{\kappa}=\hat{b}\cdot\nabla\hat{b}\) is the magnetic field
curvature and \(\hat{b}\) is the unit vector in the direction of
\(\mathbf{B}\). The terms on the right-hand side represent energy gain
by the parallel electric field, betatron heating, Fermi acceleration,
and the polarization drift respectively. The first three mechanisms are
sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:particle_acceleration_reconnection}. The
polarization drift is particularly important for lower-energy ions, and
this terms accounts for the kinetic ennergy gain in the large-scale
reconnection outflow jets. Although
Equation~\ref{eq:particle_energization_nonrelativistic} is valid in the
non-relativistic limit, the same basic acceleration mechanisms are
responsible for energizing particles in more extreme relativistic
contexts relevant to astrophysical systems.

\caption{Illustration of particle acceleration mechanisms. The
reconnection electric field is along the \(y\) direction. Acceleration
by the reconnection electric field occurs near the X-line, which is
associated with the Speiser orbit, and by parallel electric field near
separatrices, which are boundaries between upstream
(before-reconnection) and downstream (after-reconnection) regions. When
particles near the X-line interact with the parallel electric field,
ions (electrons) are accelerated along the (opposite) direction of the
field, and the direct acceleration term \(qE_\parallel v_\parallel\)
(the first term on the right side of
Equation~\ref{eq:particle_energization_nonrelativistic}) is positive.
The betatron acceleration mechanism happens when particles flow into the
stronger magnetic field regions in the exhaust. In this example
trajectory, particles move along the positive z direction by the EEE ×
BBB motion and \(\nabla B\) is also along the positive z direction. As a
result, the second term of
Equation~\ref{eq:particle_energization_nonrelativistic} is positive.
Fermi acceleration occurs in the regions with high-curvature magnetic
field lines. In this example, plasmoids are elongated along the \(z\)
direction, such that the field lines have the highest curvature at
\(x = 0\). Inside the plasmoid, particles obtain a large velocity kick
along the \(y\) direction due to a large curvature drift and obtain a
significant energy from the reconnection electric field
(\(q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{u}_c > 0\)). In the exhaust region, trapped
particles gain energy whenever they pass the high curvature regions at
\(x = 0\). di is ion skin depth. Figure 5 from
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ji2022magnetic}{Ji et al.,

}
\end{figure}

Particles gain energy when their drift induced by the curvature of the
magnetic field lines is aligned with the reconnection electric field,
which is a form of Fermi heating. Fermi acceleration may resolve two
major challenges for heating models. First, it may operate over large
volumes in the presence of many magnetic islands or plasmoids, which may
be sampled by electrons in the presence of 3D ergodic field lines. There
are several space observations of energetic electrons near magnetic
islands or plasmoids. Second, the Fermi process naturally generates
power laws because a particle undergoing Fermi acceleration gains energy
at a rate proportional to its energy,
\(\delta\mathcal{E}\propto \mathcal{E}\). In the non-relativistic limit,
adiabatic particle energization by Fermi acceleration along with the
other heating mechanisms for magnetized particles leads to a Parker-like
transport equation for the distribution \(f(v_\parallel, v_\perp)\) of
particles within a magnetic flux tube including time-varying plasma
density \(n\) and magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:parker_transport}{}{
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{\dot{B}}{B}v_\perp^2\frac{\partial f}{\partial v_\perp^2} + \left( \frac{\dot{n}}{n} - \frac{\dot{B}}{B} \right)v_\parallel\frac{\partial f}{\partial v_\parallel} = \frac{D\{ f \}}{\tau_\text{diff}} - \frac{f}{\tau_\text{esc}} + \frac{f_\text{inj}}{\tau_\text{inj}}
}\label{eq:parker_transport}\end{equation}

where \(\frac{D\{ f \}}{\tau_\text{diff}}\) includes diffusive processes
such as pitch-angle or energy scattering, \(\tau_\text{esc}\) is a
typical time for particles to escape the reconnection geometry, and
\(f_\text{inj}/\tau_\text{inj}\) is a source of newly injected
particles. This transport equation leads to power-law solutions under
certain assumptions, though the Fermi process becomes much less
effective at generating power-law nonthermal tails in the presence of a
significant guide magnetic field component. With certain assumptions, it
is possible to solve the Parker equation using the velocity and magnetic
fields from MHD simulations to obtain predictions of the particle
acceleration, but this approach does not include the self-consistent
feedback.

\hypertarget{test-particle-model}{%
\section{Test Particle Model}\label{test-particle-model}}

The test particle method is not self-consistent, because we only
describe the effect of the fields onto particles, but not vice versa.
This reduces the PDEs to ODEs which is much simpler to solve. Despite of
this, we use the trajectories of test particles to infer approximate
kinetic properties of the system. You will see many examples of
understanding more complicated scenario using the drifts derived from
test particle motions, especially in terms of stability analysis.

There are four methods in test particle modelling:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Trajectory sampling. It solves individual particle trajectories, but
  it may not be trivial to select the samples.
\item
  Forward Monte Carlo. We inject particles in source regions where \(f\)
  is known, and follow them until they reach the regions of interest.
  This is similar to PIC, except that the fields are not
  self-consistent.
\item
  \emph{Forward Liouville}.
\item
  \emph{Backward Liouville}. It also makes use of the Liouville's
  theorem for \(f\), but there is no sampling, neither in \(\mathbf{x}\)
  nor in \(\mathbf{v}\) space, implying no statistical errors. The
  procedure starts by choosing a given point \(\mathbf{x}\) in space
  \ldots{}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sec:fluid}{%
\chapter{Plasmas as Fluid}\label{sec:fluid}}

In a plasma the situation is much more complicated than that single
particle orbits; the \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) fields are not
prescribed but are determined by the positions and motions of the
charges themselves. One must solve a self-consistent problem; that is,
find a set of particle trajectories and field patterns such that the
particles will generate the fields as they move along their orbits and
the fields will cause the particles to move in those exact orbits. And
this must be done in a time-varying situation. It sounds very hard, but
it is not.

We have seen that a typical plasma density might be \(10^{18}\)
ion--electron pairs per \(\text{m}^3\). If each of these particles
follows a complicated trajectory and it is necessary to follow each of
these, predicting the plasma's behavior would be a hopeless task.
Fortunately, this is not usually necessary because, surprisingly, the
majority-perhaps as much as 80\%-of plasma phenomena observed in real
experiments can be explained by a rather crude model. This model is that
used in fluid mechanics, in which the identity of the individual
particle is neglected, and only the motion of fluid elements is taken
into account. Of course, in the case of plasmas, the fluid contains
electrical charges. In an ordinary fluid, frequent collisions between
particles keep the particles in a fluid element moving together. It is
surprising that such a model works for plasmas, which generally have
infrequent collisions. But we shall see that there is a reason for this.

A more refined treatment-the kinetic theory of plasmas-requires more
mathematical calculation. An introduction to kinetic theory is given in
Section~\ref{sec:kinetic}.

In some plasma problems, neither fluid theory nor kinetic theory is
sufficient to describe the plasma's behavior. Then one has to fall back
on the tedious process of following the individual trajectories.
Brute-force computer simulation can play an important role in filling
the gap between theory and experiment in those instances where even
kinetic theory cannot come close to explaining what is observed.

where \(s\) denotes the species (e.g.~\(\text{H}^+, \text{O}^+\)). Do
not confuse \(\sigma\) here with conductivity. Then the total quantities
without subscripts can be written as

\[
\begin{aligned}
&n=\sum_s{n_s} \\

It can be easily verified that

\[
\sum_s{\rho_s\mathbf{v}_s}=0

In this note we tried to use \(\mathbf{v}\) for all
species/particle-based velocities, and \(\mathbf{u}\) for all bulk
velocities.

We have 5 independent unknown quantities for each species:
\(n_j, \mathbf{u}_j, p_j\). The pressure can be replaced by temperature
\(T_j\). Additionally, we have the 6 EM field quantities:
\(\mathbf{B}, \mathbf{E}\). For a 2-fluid despcription with ions and
electrons, altogether we have \(5*2+6=16\) unknowns, so we need 16
equations to determine the system.

\section{Relation of Plasma Physics to Ordinary
Electromagnetics}\label{relation-of-plasma-physics-to-ordinary-electromagnetics}}

\hypertarget{maxwells-equations}{%
\subsection{Maxwell's Equations}\label{maxwells-equations}}

In vacuum:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:maxwell_vacuum}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_0 \nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} &= \sigma \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} &= -\dot{\mathbf{B}} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 (\mathbf{j}+\epsilon_0\dot{\mathbf{E}})
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:maxwell_vacuum}\end{equation}

In a medium:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:maxwell_medium}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{D} &= \sigma \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} &= -\dot{\mathbf{B}} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{H} &= \mathbf{j}+\dot{\mathbf{D}} \\
\mathbf{D} &= \epsilon\mathbf{E} \\
\mathbf{B} &= \mu\mathbf{H}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:maxwell_medium}\end{equation}

\(\sigma\) and \(\mathbf{j}\) stand for the ``free'' charge and current
densities. The ``bound'' charge and current densities arising from
polarization and magnetization of the medium are included in the
definition of the quantities \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) in terms
of \(\epsilon\) and \(\mu\). In a plasma, the ions and electrons
comprising the plasma are the equivalent of the ``bound'' charges and
currents. Since these charges move in a complicated way, it is
impractical to try to lump their effects into two constants \(\epsilon\)
and \(\mu\). Consequently, in plasma physics, one generally works with
the vacuum equations, in which \(\sigma\) and \(\mathbf{j}\) include
\emph{all} the charges and currents, both external and internal.

Note that we have used \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) in the vacuum
equations rather than their counterparts \(\mathbf{D}\) and
\(\mathbf{H}\), which are related by the constants \(\epsilon_0\) and
\(\mu_0\). This is because the forces \(q\mathbf{E}\) and
\(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}\) depend on \(\mathbf{E}\) and
\(\mathbf{B}\) rather than \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\), and it is
not necessary to introduce the latter quantities as long as one is
dealing with the vacuum equations.

\hypertarget{classical-treatment-of-magnetic-materials}{%
\subsection{Classical Treatment of Magnetic
Materials}\label{classical-treatment-of-magnetic-materials}}

Since each gyrating particle has a magnetic moment, it would seem that
the logical thing to do would be to consider a plasma as a magnetic
material with a permeability \(\mu_m\). ((We have put a subscript \(m\)
on the permeability to distinguish it from the adiabatic invariant
\(\mu\).) To see why this is \emph{not} done in practice, let us review
the way magnetic materials are usually treated.

The ferromagnetic domains, say, of a piece of iron have magnetic moments
\(\mu_i\), giving rise to a bulk magnetization

\[
\mathbf{M} = \frac{1}{V}\sum_i\mu_i
\]

per unit volume. This has the same effect as a bound current density
equal to

\[
\mathbf{j}_b = \nabla\times\mathbf{M}
\]

In the vacuum Ampère's law, we must include in \(\mathbf{j}\) both this
current and the ``free'', or externally applied, current
\(\mathbf{j}_f\):

\[
\mu_0^{-1}\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{j}_f + \mathbf{j}_b + \epsilon_0 \dot{\mathbf{E}}
\]

We wish to write this equation in the simple form

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{j}_f + \epsilon_0\dot{\mathbf{E}}
\]

by including \(\mathbf{j}_b\) in the definition of \(\mathbf{H}\). This
can be done if we let

\[
\mathbf{H} = \mu_0^{-1}\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{M}
\]

To get a simple relation between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\), we
assume \(\mathbf{M}\) to be proportional to \(\mathbf{B}\) or
\(\mathbf{H}\):

\[
\mathbf{M} = \chi_m \mathbf{H}
\]

The constant \(\chi_m\) is the magnetic susceptibility. We now have

\[
\mathbf{B} = \mu_0(1+\chi_m)\mathbf{H} \equiv \mu_m \mathbf{H}
\]

This simple relation between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) is
possible because of the linear relation between \(\mathbf{M}\) and
\(\mathbf{H}\).

In a plasma with a magnetic field, each particle has a magnetic moment
\(\mu_\alpha\), and the quantity \(\mathbf{M}\) is the sum of all these
\(\mu_\alpha\)'s in 1 \(\text{m}^3\). But now we have

\[
\mu_\alpha = \frac{mv_{\perp\alpha}^2}{2B}\propto \frac{1}{B}\quad \mathbf{M}\propto \frac{1}{B}
\]

The relation between \(\mathbf{M}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) (or
\(\mathbf{B}\)) is no longer linear, and we cannot write
\(\mathbf{B} = \mu_m\mathbf{H}\) with \(\mu_m\) constant. It is
therefore not useful to consider a plasma as a magnetic medium.

\hypertarget{classical-treatment-of-dielectrics}{%
\subsection{Classical Treatment of
Dielectrics}\label{classical-treatment-of-dielectrics}}

The polarization \(\mathbf{P}\) per unit volume is the sum over all the
individual moments \(\mathbf{p}_i\) of the electric dipoles. This gives
rise to a bound charge density

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:bound_charge_polarization}{}{
\sigma_b = -\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}
}\label{eq:bound_charge_polarization}\end{equation}

In the vacuum equation, we must include both the bound charge and the
free charge:

\[
\epsilon_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \sigma_f + \sigma_b
\]

We wish to write this in the simple form

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{D} = \sigma_f
\]

by including \(\sigma_b\) in the definition of \(\mathbf{D}\). This can
be done by letting

\[
\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \equiv \epsilon \mathbf{E}
\]

If \(\mathbf{P}\) is linearly proportional to \(\mathbf{E}\),

\[
\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi_e\mathbf{E}
\]

then \(\epsilon\) is a constant given by

\[
\epsilon = (1+\chi_e)\epsilon_0
\]

There is no a priori reason why a relation like the above cannot be
valid in a plasma, so we may proceed to try to get an expression for
\(\epsilon\) in a plasma.

\hypertarget{the-dielectric-constant-of-a-plasma}{%
\subsection{The Dielectric Constant of a
Plasma}\label{the-dielectric-constant-of-a-plasma}}

We have seen in Section~\ref{sec:time-varying_E} that a fluctuating
\(\mathbf{E}\) field gives rise to a polarization current
\(\mathbf{j}_p\). This leads, in turn, to a polarization charge given by
the equation of continuity:

\[
\frac{\partial \sigma_p}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}_p = 0
\]

This is the equivalent of Equation~\ref{eq:bound_charge_polarization},
except that, as we noted before, a polarization effect does not arise in
a plasma unless the electric field is time varying. Since we have an
explicit expression for \(\mathbf{j}_p\) but not for \(\sigma_p\), it is
easier to work with the Ampère's law:

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0(\mathbf{j}_f +\mathbf{j}_p + \epsilon\dot{\mathbf{E}})
\]

We wish to write this in the form

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0(\mathbf{j}_f + \epsilon\dot{\mathbf{E}})
\]

This can be done if we let

\[
\epsilon = \epsilon_0 + \frac{j_p}{\dot{E}}
\]

From Equation~\ref{eq:polarization_current} for \(\mathbf{j}_p\), we
have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dielectric_constant_low-frequency}{}{
\epsilon = \epsilon_0 + \frac{\rho}{B^2}\quad \text{or}\quad \epsilon_R\equiv \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} = 1+\frac{\mu_0\rho c^2}{B^2}
}\label{eq:dielectric_constant_low-frequency}\end{equation}

This is the \emph{low-frequency plasma dielectric constant for
transverse motions}. The qualifications are necessary because our
expression for \(\mathbf{j}_p\) is valid only for
\(\omega^2\ll\omega_c^2\) and for \(\mathbf{E}\) perpendicular to
\(\mathbf{B}\). The general expression for \(\epsilon\), of course, is
very complicated and hardly fits on one page.

Note that as \(\rho\rightarrow 0\), \(\epsilon_R\) approaches its vacuum
value, unity, as it should. As \(B\rightarrow\infty\), \(\epsilon_R\)
also approaches unity. This is because the polarization drift
\(\mathbf{v}_p\) then vanishes, and the particles do not move in
response to the transverse electric field. In a usual laboratory plasma,
the second term in Equation~\ref{eq:dielectric_constant_low-frequency}
is large compared with unity. For instance, if
\(n=10^{16}\,\text{m}^{-3}\) and \(B=0.1\,\text{T}\) we have (for
hydrogen)

\[
\frac{\mu_0\rho c^2}{B^2} = \frac{(4\pi\times 10^{-7})(10^{16})(1.67\times 10^{-27})(3\times 10^8)^2}{(0.1)^2} = 189
\]

This means that the electric fields due to the particles in the plasma
greatly alter the fields applied externally. A plasma with large
\(\epsilon\) shields out alternating fields, just as a plasma with small
\(\lambda_D\) shields out dc fields.

\hypertarget{the-single-fluid-mhd-equations}{%
\section{The Single-Fluid MHD
Equations}\label{the-single-fluid-mhd-equations}}

In (\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2016introduction}{F. F. Chen, 2016}),
this is introduced in the diffusion chapter 5.7, which is a bit weird.

There are three basic assumptions in MHD:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon\omega/4\pi\sigma& \ll 1, \\
(v/c)^2&\ll 1,\\
\lambda/ L& \ll 1,
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\omega\) is the plasma frequency, \(v\) is the plasma bulk
speed, \(\lambda\) is the average free distance, and \(L\) is the system
characteristic length.

Standard orderings of ideal MHD can also be written as

\[
\epsilon \sim \omega/\Omega_c \sim k\rho
\]

where the plasma varies on frequency scales \(\omega\) small compared to
the gyrofrequency \(\Omega_c\), and varies on spatial scales \(1/k\)
long compared to the gyroradius \(\rho\). (Here, \(\epsilon\) means a
``small'' value.) Thus it covers phenomenon related to compressional and
shear Alfvén waves and instabilities, ion acoustic waves, and ion and
electron kinetic effects such as Landau damping. However, it does not
include drift-waves or other micro-instabilities because they result
from finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects which vanish in the usual MHD
ordering.

Single fluid MHD is somehow inconsistent since there is only one
velocity. The definition of current using velocity cannot be applied,
and the current can only be given by Ampere's law (without the
displacement current), \(\mathbf{J}=\nabla\times\mathbf{B}/\mu_0\).

\hypertarget{equation-of-continuity}{%
\subsection{Equation of Continuity}\label{equation-of-continuity}}

The integral form of mass conservation for each species is

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\int_V \rho_s dx^3=0
\]

The conservation of matter requires that the total number of particles
\(N_s\) in a volume V can change only if there is a net flux of
particles across the surface S bounding that volume. Since the particle
flux density is \(n_s\mathbf{u}_s\), we have, by the divergence theorem,

\[
\frac{\partial N_s}{\partial t} = \int_V\frac{\partial n_s}{\partial t}dV = -\oint n\mathbf{u}_s\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = - \int_V \nabla\cdot(n_s\mathbf{u}_s)dV
\]

Since this must hold for any volume V, the integrands must be equal:

\[
\frac{\partial n_s}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(n_s\mathbf{u}_s) = 0
\]

There is one such \emph{equation of continuity} for each species. Any
sources or sinks of particles are to be added to the right-hand side.

\hypertarget{momentum-equation}{%
\subsection{Momentum Equation}\label{momentum-equation}}

Maxwell's equations tell us what \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are
for a given state of the plasma. To solve the self-consistent problem,
we must also have an equation giving the plasma's response to given
\(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\). In the fluid approximation, we
consider the plasma to be composed of two or more interpenetrating
fluids, one for each species. In the simplest case, when there is only
one species of ion, we shall need two equations of motion, one for the
positively charged ion fluid and one for the negatively charged electron
fluid. In a partially ionized gas, we shall also need an equation for
the fluid of neutral atoms. The neutral fluid will interact with the
ions and electrons only through collisions. The ion and electron fluids
will interact with each other even in the absence of collisions, because
of the \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) fields they generate.

The equation of motion for a single particle is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:single_motion}{}{
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})
}\label{eq:single_motion}\end{equation}

Assume first that there are no collisions and no thermal motions. Then
all the particles in a fluid element move together, and the average
velocity \(\mathbf{u}\) of the particles in the element is the same as
the individual particle velocity \(\mathbf{v}\). The fluid equation is
obtained simply by multiplying Equation~\ref{eq:single_motion} by the
density \(n\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:single_fluid1}{}{
mn\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d}t} = qn(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B})
}\label{eq:single_fluid1}\end{equation}

This is, however, not a convenient form to use. In
Equation~\ref{eq:single_motion}, the time derivative is to be taken
\emph{at the position of the particles}. On the other hand, we wish to
have an equation for fluid elements \emph{fixed in space}, because it
would be impractical to do otherwise. Consider a drop of cream in a cup
of coffee as a fluid element. As the coffee is stirred, the drop
distorts into a filament and finally disperses all over the cup, losing
its identity. A fluid element at a fixed spot in the cup, however,
retains its identity although particles continually go in and out of it.

To make the transformation to variables in a fixed frame, consider
\(\mathbf{G}(x,t)\) to be any property of a fluid in one-dimensional x
space. The change of \(\mathbf{G}\) with time \emph{in a frame moving
with the fluid} is the sum of two terms:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{G}(x,t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial t} + u_x\frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial x}
\]

The first term on the right represents the change of \(\mathbf{G}\) at a
fixed point in space, and the second term represents the change of G as
the observer moves with the fluid into a region in which \(\mathbf{G}\)
is different. In three dimensions, this generalizes to

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{G}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{G}
\]

This is called the \emph{convective derivative} and is sometimes written
\(\frac{D\mathbf{G}}{Dt}\). Note that \((\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\) is a
\emph{scalar} differential operator.

In the case of a plasma, we take \(\mathbf{G}\) to be the fluid velocity
\(\mathbf{u}\) and write Equation~\ref{eq:single_fluid1} as

\[
mn\Big[\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\Big] = qn(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B})
\]

where \(\partial\mathbf{u}/\partial t\) is the time derivative in a
fixed frame.

\textbf{Stress Tensor} --\textgreater{} scalar pressure

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:single_fluid2}{}{
mn\Big[\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\Big] = qn(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}) - \nabla p
}\label{eq:single_fluid2}\end{equation}

What we have shown here is only a special case: the transfer of x
momentum by motion in the x direction; and we have assumed that the
fluid is isotropic, so that the same result holds in the y and z
directions. But it is also possible to transfer y momentum by motion in
the x direction, for instance. This shear stress cannot be represented
by a scalar \(p\) but must be given by a tensor \(\mathbf{P}\), the
stress tensor, whose components \(P_{ij}= mn\overline{v_i v_j}\) specify
both the direction of motion and the component of momentum involved. In
the general case the term \(\nabla p\) is replaced by
\(-\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}\).

When the distribution function is an isotropic Maxwellian,
\(\mathbf{P}\) is written

\[
\mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix}p & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & p & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & p\end{pmatrix}
\]

\(-\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P} = \nabla p\). A plasma could have two
temperatures \(T_\perp\) and \(T_\parallel\) in the presence of a
magnetic field. In that case, there would be two pressures \(T_\perp\)
and \(T_\parallel\) in the presence of a magnetic field. In that case,
there would be two pressure \(p_\perp = nk_B T_\perp\) and
\(p_\parallel = nk_B T_\parallel\). The stress tensor is then

\[
\mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix}p_\perp & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & p_\perp & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & p_\parallel\end{pmatrix}
\]

where the coordinate of the third row or column is the direction of
\(\mathbf{B}\). This is still diagonal and shows isotropy in a plane
perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\).

In an ordinary fluid, the off-diagonal elements of \(\mathbf{P}\) are
usually associated with viscosity. When particles make collisions, they
come off with an average velocity in the direction of the fluid velocity
\(\mathbf{u}\) at the point where they made their last collision. This
momentum is transferred to another fluid element upon the next
collision. This tends to equalize \(\mathbf{u}\) at different points,
and the resulting resistance to shear flow is what we intuitively think
of as viscosity. The longer the mean free path, the farther momentum is
carried, and the larger is the viscosity. In a plasma there is a similar
effect which occurs even in the absence of collisions. The Larmor
gyration of particles (particularly ions) brings them into different
parts of the plasma and tends to equalize the fluid velocities there.
The Larmor radius rather than the mean free path sets the scale of this
kind of collisionless viscosity. It is a \emph{finite-Larmor-radius
effect} which occurs in addition to collisional viscosity and is closely
related to the \(\mathbf{v}_E\) drift in a nonuniform \(\mathbf{E}\)
field (Equation~\ref{eq:vE}).

\textbf{Collisions}

If there is a neutral gas, the charged fluid will exchange momentum with
it through collisions. The momentum lost per collision will be
proportional to the relative velocity \(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}_0\), where
\(\mathbf{u}_0\) is the velocity of the neutral fluid. If \(\tau\), the
mean free time between collisions, is approximately constant, the
resulting force term can be roughly written as
\(-mn(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}_0)/\tau\). The equation of motion can be
generalized to include anisotropic pressure and neutral collisions as
follows:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:momentum_single}{}{
mn\Big[\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\Big] = qn(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}) - \nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P} - \frac{mn(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}_0)}{\tau}
}\label{eq:momentum_single}\end{equation}

This can also be written as (including the pressure term and other
forces)

\[
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d}t}=(\rho^\ast \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B})-\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}+\mathbf{f}_n
\]

or, in an equivalent conservative form,

\[
\frac{\partial (\rho\mathbf{u})}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u})=(\rho^\ast \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B})-\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}+\mathbf{f}_n
\]

Collisions between charged particles have not been included; these will
be discussed in sec:collision ADD IT!.

\textbf{Comparison with Ordinary Hydrodynamics}

Ordinary fluids obey the Navier--Stokes equation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:navier_stokes}{}{
\rho\Big[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} \Big] = -\nabla p + \rho\nu\nabla^2\mathbf{u}
}\label{eq:navier_stokes}\end{equation}

This is the same as Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_single} except for the
absence of electromagnetic forces and collisions between species (there
being only one species). The viscosity term
\(\rho\nu\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\), where \(\nu\) is the kinematic viscosity
coefficient, is just the collisional part of
\(\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P} - \nabla p\) in the absence of
magnetic fields. Equation~\ref{eq:navier_stokes} describes a fluid in
which there are frequent collisions between particles.
Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_single}, on the other hand, was derived
without any explicit statement of the collision rate. Since the two
equations are identical except for the \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\)
terms, can Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_single} really describe a plasma
species? The answer is a guarded yes, and the reasons for this will tell
us the limitations of the fluid theory. This is extremely important to
clarify --- there are still quite many people think that collision is
assumed for the fluid theory, therefore do not believe that MHD can be
used to describe plasmas.

In the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_single}, we did actually
assume implicitly that there were many collisions. This assumption came
in the derivation of the pressure tensor (TO BE ADDED!) when we took the
velocity distribution to be Maxwellian. Such a distribution generally
comes about as the result of frequent collisions. However, this
assumption was used only to take the average of \(v^2\). Any other
distribution with the same average would give us the same answer. The
fluid theory, therefore, is not very sensitive to deviations from the
Maxwellian distribution, but there are instances in which these
deviations are important. Kinetic theory must then be used.

There is also an empirical observation by Irving Langmuir which helps
the fluid theory. In working with the electrostatic probes which bear
his name, Langmuir discovered that the electron distribution function
was far more nearly Maxwellian than could be accounted for by the
collision rate. This phenomenon, called \emph{Langmuir's paradox}, has
been attributed at times to high-frequency oscillations. There has been
no satisfactory resolution of the paradox, but this seems to be one of
the few instances in plasma physics where nature works in our favor.

Another reason the fluid model works for plasmas is that the magnetic
field, when there is one, can play the role of collisions in a certain
sense. When a particle is accelerated, say by an \(\mathbf{E}\) field,
it would continuously increase in velocity if it were allowed to
free-stream. When there are frequent collisions, the particle comes to a
limiting velocity proportional to \(\mathbf{E}\). The electrons in a
copper wire, for instance, drift together with a velocity
\(\mathbf{v}=\mu\mathbf{E}\), where \(\mu\) is the mobility. A magnetic
field also limits free-streaming by forcing particles to gyrate in
Larmor orbits. The electrons in a plasma also drift together with a
velocity proportional to \(\mathbf{E}\), namely,
\(\mathbf{v}_E=\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}/B^2\). In this sense, a
collisionless plasma behaves like a collisional fluid. Of course,
particles do free-stream \emph{along} the magnetic field, and the fluid
picture is not particularly suitable for motions in that direction.
\emph{For motions perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\), the fluid theory is a
good approximation}.

\textbf{Equation of State}

One more relation is needed to close the system of equations. For this,
the simplest way is to use the thermodynamic equation of state relating
\(p\) to \(n\):

\[
p = C\rho^\gamma
\]

where \(C\) is a constant and \(\gamma\) is the ratio of specific heats
\(C_p/C_\nu\). The term \(\nabla p\) is therefore given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:eos_nabla_p}{}{
\frac{\nabla p}{p} = \gamma \frac{\nabla n}{n}
}\label{eq:eos_nabla_p}\end{equation}

For isothermal compression, we have

\[
\nabla p = \nabla(nk_B T) = k_B T\nabla n
\]

so that, clearly, \(\gamma=1\). For adiabatic compression, \(k_B T\)
will also change, giving \(\gamma\) a value larger than one. If \(N\) is
the number of degrees of freedom, \(\gamma\) is given by

\[
\gamma = (2+N)/N
\]

The validity of the equation of state requires that heat flow be
negligible; that is, that thermal conductivity be low. Again, this is
more likely to be true in directions perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\)
than parallel to it. Fortunately, most basic phenomena can be described
adequately by the crude assumption of the equation of state.

\textbf{The Complete Set of Fluid Equations}

For simplicity, let the plasma have only two species: ions and
electrons; extension to more species is trivial. The charge and current
densities are then given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma &= n_i q_i + n_e q_e \\
\mathbf{j} &= n_i q_i \mathbf{v}_i + n_e q_e \mathbf{v}_e
\end{aligned}
\]

We shall neglect collisions and viscosity. The above discussions form
the following equation set:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fluid_set}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = n_i q_i + n_e q_e \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\dot{\mathbf{B}} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} = 0 \\
\mu_0^{-1}\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = n_i q_i \mathbf{u}_i + n_e q_e \mathbf{u}_e + \epsilon_0\dot{\mathbf{E}} \\
m_jn_j\Big[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_j}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{u}_j\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_j\Big] = q_j n_j (\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}_j\times\mathbf{B}) - \nabla p_j\quad j=i,e \\
\frac{\partial n_j}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(n_j\mathbf{u}_j) = 0\quad j=i,e \\
p_j = C_j n_j^\gamma\quad j=i,e
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:fluid_set}\end{equation}

There are 16 scalar unknowns:
\(n_i, n_e, p_i, p_e, \mathbf{u}_i, \mathbf{u}_e, \mathbf{E}\), and
\(\mathbf{B}\). There are apparently 18 scalar equations if we count
each vector equation as three scalar equations. However, two of
Maxwell's equations are superfluous, since the two of the equations can
be recovered from the divergences of the other two. The simultaneous
solution of this set of 16 equations in 16 unknowns gives a
self-consistent set of fields and motions in the fluid approximation.

\hypertarget{generalized-ohms-law}{%
\section{Generalized Ohm's Law}\label{generalized-ohms-law}}

DERIVATIONS TO BE ADDED\ldots{}

The generalized Ohm's law can be derived from two-fluid equations:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:genearlized_ohm_law}{}{
\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B} + \eta\mathbf{j} + \frac{1}{en}\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}-\frac{1}{en}\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}_e +\frac{m_e}{ne^2}\Big[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{j}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{j}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}\mathbf{j}) \Big]
}\label{eq:genearlized_ohm_law}\end{equation}

where the first term on the right-hand side is the \emph{convection
term}, the second term is the \emph{resistivity term} (\emph{conductive
term}), the third term is called the \emph{Hall term}, the fourth term
is the \emph{electron pressure term}, and the fifth term is called the
\emph{electron inertia term}, since it is proportional to the mass of
electrons.

Note that both \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{j}\) are the first-order
moments, with \(\mathbf{u}\) being the (weighted) sum of the first-order
moment of electrons and ions while \(\mathbf{j}\) being the difference
between them. The generalized Ohm's law is actually the difference
between the electrons' and ions' first-order moment equations. \emph{The
generalized Ohm's law is an equation that governs the time evolution of
\(\mathbf{j}\)}. Also note that Ampere's law, with the displacement
current retained, is an equation governing the time evolution of
\(\mathbf{E}\). However, in the approximation of the resistive MHD, the
time derivative terms \(\partial \mathbf{E}/\partial t\) and
\(\partial \mathbf{j} /\partial t\) are ignored in Ampere's law and
Ohm's law, respectively. In this approximation, Ohm's law is directly
solved to determine \(\mathbf{E}\) and Ampere's law is directly solved
to determine \(\mathbf{j}\). {[}Introduction to plasma physics: with

\]

Denote each term above with a to e. From the single-fluid MHD momentum
equation, let \(\omega\) be the oscillation frequency of the perturbed
velocity, and variable in scalar form be the characteristic magnitude of
that quantity,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_scale}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\rho\big( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}\big) = \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B} - \nabla p +\rho\mathbf{g} \\
\Rightarrow \omega\rho U\sim J B
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_scale}\end{equation}

Using and the assumptions of MHD, the relations between each term in
generalized Ohm's law are

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{b}{d} &= \frac{UB}{JB/en_e} = \frac{en_eUB}{\omega \rho U} = \frac{en_e B}{\omega n_e m_i} = \frac{\Omega_i}{\omega} \gg 1 \\
\frac{c}{d} &= \frac{J/\sigma}{JB/en_e} = \frac{en_e}{B\sigma} = \frac{en_e}{Be^2 n_e/\nu_{ei} m_e} = \frac{\nu_{ei}}{\Omega_e} \ll 1 \\
\frac{b}{d} &= \frac{U}{J/en_e} \ll 1,\ \text{if } \mathbf{J} \text{ is carried by } \mathbf{u}_e
\end{aligned}
\]

which generates direct contradiction with the MHD assumption that
\(\mathbf{u}\ll \mathbf{u}_e\) if currents are mostly carried by
electrons. (WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURE TERM SCALING? The gradient implies
that it is related to the system size; the pressure implies that it is
also related to thermal motion?)

There is an interesting point about the electron pressure term. If we
assume an isotropic plasma with \(n_i=n_e\) and an adiabatic process
\(P/n^\gamma=C\) where \(C\) is a constant and \(\gamma\) is the
adiabatic index, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:E_grad_pe}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{E}_{\nabla P_e} &= \frac{\nabla P_e}{n} = \frac{\nabla P_i}{n} = \frac{\nabla(Cn^\gamma)}{n} \\
&= C\gamma n^{\gamma-2}\nabla n = C\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\nabla n^{\gamma-1}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:E_grad_pe}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:E_grad_pe} indicates that the associated electric field
is a potential field that only relates to density.

\hypertarget{fluid-drifts-perpendicular-to-b}{%
\section{Fluid Drifts Perpendicular to
B}\label{fluid-drifts-perpendicular-to-b}}

Since a fluid element is composed of many individual particles, one
would expect the fluid to have drifts perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\) if
the individual guiding centers have such drifts. However, since the
\(\nabla p\) term appears only in the fluid equations, there is a drift
associated with it which the fluid elements have but the particles do
not have. For each species, we have an equation of motion

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:momentum_single_fluid_ratio}{}{
mn\Big[ \underbrace{\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{1}+\underbrace{(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{2}\Big] = q n (\mathbf{E}+\underbrace{\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}}_{3}) - \nabla p
}\label{eq:momentum_single_fluid_ratio}\end{equation}

Consider the ratio of term 1 to term 3:

\[
\frac{\text{term }1}{\text{term }3} \approx \bigg\lvert\frac{mni\omega v_\perp}{qnv_\perp B}\bigg\rvert \approx \frac{\omega}{\omega_c}
\]

Here we have taken \(\partial/\partial t=i\omega\) and are concerned
only with \(\mathbf{v}_\perp\). For drifts slow compared with the time
scale associated with \(\omega_c\), we may neglect term 1. We shall also
neglect the \((\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\) term and show a
\emph{posteriori} that this is all right. Let \(\mathbf{E}\) and
\(\mathbf{B}\) be uniform, but let \(n\) and \(p\) have a gradient. This
is the usual situation in a magnetically confined plasma column (Fig.
3.4 ADD FIGURE!). Taking the cross product of
Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_single_fluid_ratio} with B, we have
(neglecting the left-hand side)

\[
\begin{aligned}
0 &= qn[\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}+(\mathbf{u}_\perp\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B}] - \nabla p\times\mathbf{B} \\
&= qn[\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}(\cancel{\mathbf{u}_\perp\cdot\mathbf{B}})-\mathbf{u}_\perp\mathbf{B}^2] - \nabla p\times\mathbf{B} \\
&= qn[\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{u}_\perp\mathbf{B}^2] - \nabla p\times\mathbf{B}
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore,

\[
\mathbf{u}_\perp = \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} -\frac{\nabla p \times\mathbf{B}}{qnB^2} \equiv \mathbf{u}_E + \mathbf{u}_D
\]

where

\[
\mathbf{u}_E\equiv\frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\quad\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\,\text{drift}
\]

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diamagnetic_drift}{}{
\mathbf{u}_D\equiv-\frac{\nabla p\times\mathbf{B}}{qnB^2}\quad\text{Diamagnetic drift}
}\label{eq:diamagnetic_drift}\end{equation}

The drift \(\mathbf{u}_E\) is the same as for guiding centers, but there
is now a new drift \(\mathbf{u}_D\), called the diamagnetic drift. Since
\(\mathbf{u}_D\) is perpendicular to the direction of the gradient, our
neglect of \((\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\) is justified if
\(\mathbf{E}=0\). If \(\mathbf{E}=-\nabla\phi\neq 0\) (i.e.~a potential
field), \((\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\) is still zero if
\(\nabla\phi\) and \(\nabla p\) are in the same direction; otherwise,
there could be a more complicated solution involving
\((\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\).

With the help of Equation~\ref{eq:eos_nabla_p}, we can write the
diamagnetic drift as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diamagnetic_drift_eos}{}{
\mathbf{u}_D = \pm \frac{\gamma k_B T}{eB}\frac{\hat{z}\times\nabla n}{n}
}\label{eq:diamagnetic_drift_eos}\end{equation}

In particular, for an isothermal plasma in the geometry of Fig.3.4 (ADD
IT!), in which
\(\nabla n = \partial n\partial r\hat{r} = n^\prime\hat{r}\)
(\(n^\prime < 0\)), we have the following formulas familiar to
experimentalists who have worked with Q-machines

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u}_{Di} &= \frac{k_B T_i}{eB}\frac{n^\prime}{n}\hat{\theta} \\
\mathbf{u}_{De} &= -\frac{k_B T_e}{eB}\frac{n^\prime}{n}\hat{\theta}
\end{aligned}
\]

The physical reason for this drift can be seen from
Figure~\ref{fig:diamagnetic_drift}. Here we have drawn the orbits of
ions gyrating in a magnetic field. There is a density gradient toward
the left, as indicated by the density of orbits. Through any fixed
volume element there are more ions moving downward than upward, since
the downward-moving ions come from a region of higher density. There is,
therefore, a fluid drift perpendicular to \(\nabla n\) and
\(\mathbf{B}\), \emph{even though the guiding centers are stationary}.
The diamagnetic drift reverses sign with \(q\) because the direction of
gyration reverses. The magnitude of \(\mathbf{u}_D\) does not depend on
mass because the \(m^{-1/2}\) dependence of the velocity is cancelled by
the \(m^{1/2}\) dependence of the Larmor radius---less of the density
gradient is sampled during a gyration if the mass is small.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:diamagnetic_drift}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/origin_diamagnetic_drift.jpeg}
\caption{Origin of the diamagnetic drift.}\label{fig:diamagnetic_drift}
}
\end{figure}

Since ions and electrons drift in opposite directions, there is a
diamagnetic current. For \(\gamma=Z=1\), this is given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diamagnetic_curent}{}{
\mathbf{j}_D = ne(\mathbf{u}_{Di} - \mathbf{u}_{De}) = (k_B T_i + k_B T_e)\frac{\mathbf{B}\times\nabla n}{B^2}
}\label{eq:diamagnetic_curent}\end{equation}

In the particle picture, one would not expect to measure a current if
the guiding centers do not drift. In the fluid picture, the current
\(\mathbf{j}_D\) flows wherever there is a pressure gradient. These two
viewpoints can be reconciled if one considers that all experiments must
be carried out in a finite-sized plasma. Suppose the plasma were in a
rigid box (Fig. 3.6 ADD IT!). If one were to calculate the current from
the single-particle picture, one would have to take into account the
particles at the edges which have cycloidal paths. Since there are more
particles on the left than on the right, there is a net current
downward, in agreement with the fluid picture.

The reader may not be satisfied with this explanation because it was
necessary to specify reflecting walls. If the walls were absorbing or if
they were removed, one would find that electric fields would develop
because more of one species---the one with larger Larmor radius---would
collected than the other. Then the guiding centers would drift, and the
simplicity of the model would be lost. Alternatively, one could imagine
trying to measure the diamagnetic current with a current probe (Fig. 3.7
ADD IT!). This is just a transformer with a core of magnetic material.
The primary winding is the plasma current threading the core, and the
secondary is a multiturn winding all around the core. Let the whole
thing be infinitesimally thin, so it does not intercept any particles.
It is clear from Fig. 3.7 that a net upward current would be measured,
there being higher density on the left than on the right, so that the
diamagnetic current is a real current. From this example, one can see
that it can be quite tricky to work with the single-particle picture.
The fluid theory usually gives the right results when applied
straightforwardly, even though it contains ``fictitious'' drifts like
the diamagnetic drift.

What about the grad-B and curvature drifts which appeared in the
single-particle picture? The curvature drift also exists in the fluid
picture, since the centrifugal force is felt by all the particles in a
fluid element as they move around a bend in the magnetic field. A term
\(\bar{F}_{cf} = \overline{nmv_\parallel^2}/R_c = nk_B T_\parallel / R_c\)
has to be added to the right-hand side of the fluid equation of motion.
This is equivalent to a gravitational force \(mng\), with
\(g = k_BT_\parallel/m R_c\), and leads to a drift
\(\mathbf{u}_g=(m/q)(\mathbf{g}\times\mathbf{B})/B^2\), as in the
particle picture (Equation~\ref{eq:gravity_drift}).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:nonuniform_B_no_grad_drift}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/grad-B_no_drift_nonuniform_B.png}
\caption{In a nonuniform B field the guiding centers drift but the fluid
elements do not.}\label{fig:nonuniform_B_no_grad_drift}
}
\end{figure}

The grad-B drift, however, does not exist for fluids. It can be shown on
thermodynamic grounds that a magnetic field does not affect a Maxwellian
distribution. This is because the Lorentz force is perpendicular to
\(\mathbf{v}\) and cannot change the energy of any particle. The most
probable distribution \(f(\mathbf{v})\) in the absence of \(\mathbf{B}\)
is also the most probable distribution in the presence of
\(\mathbf{B}\). If \(f(\mathbf{v})\) remains Maxwellian in a nonuniform
\(\mathbf{B}\) field, and there is no density gradient, then the net
momentum carried into any fixed fluid element is zero. There is no fluid
drift even though the individual guiding centers have drifts; the
particle drift in any fixed fluid element cancel out. To see this
pictorially, consider the orbits of two particles moving through a fluid
element in a nonuniform \(\mathbf{B}\) field
(Figure~\ref{fig:nonuniform_B_no_grad_drift}). Since there is no
\(\mathbf{E}\) field, the Larmor radius changes only because of the
gradient in B; there is no acceleration, and the particle energy remains
constant during the motion. If the two particles have the same energy,
they will have the same velocity and Larmor radius while inside the
fluid element. There is thus a perfect cancellation between particle
pairs when their velocities are added to give the fluid velocity.

When there is a nonuniform \(\mathbf{E}\) field, it is not easy to
reconcile the fluid and particle pictures. Then the finite-Larmor-radius
effect of Section~\ref{sec:nonuniform_E} causes both a guiding center
drift and a fluid drift, but these are not the same; in fact, they have
opposite signs! The particle drift was calculated in
Section~\ref{sec:single}, and the fluid drift can be calculated from the
off-diagonal elements of \(\mathbf{P}\). It is extremely difficult to
explain how the finite-Larmor-radius effects differ. A simple picture
like Fig. 3.6 will not work because one has to take into account subtle
points like the following: in the absence of a density gradient, the
density of guiding centers is not the same as the density of particles!
(???)

(I need to think carefully about these pictures.)

\hypertarget{fluid-drifts-parallel-to-b}{%
\section{Fluid Drifts Parallel to B}\label{fluid-drifts-parallel-to-b}}

The \(z\) component of the fluid equation of motions is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fluid_momentum_parallel}{}{
mn\left[ \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)u_z\right] = qn E_z - \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z}
}\label{eq:fluid_momentum_parallel}\end{equation}

The convective term can often be neglected because it is much smaller
than the \(\partial u_z/\partial t\) term. We shall avoid complicated
arguments here and simply consider cases in which \(u_z\) is spatially
uniform. Using Equation~\ref{eq:fluid_momentum_parallel}, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fluid_momentum_parallel_simple}{}{
\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial t} = \frac{q}{m}E_z - \frac{\gamma k_B T}{mn}\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}
}\label{eq:fluid_momentum_parallel_simple}\end{equation}

This shows that the fluid is accelerated along \(\mathbf{B}\) under the
combined electrostatic and pressure gradient forces. A particularly
important result is obtained by applying
Equation~\ref{eq:fluid_momentum_parallel_simple} to massless electrons.
Taking the limit \(m\rightarrow 0\) and specifying \(q=-e\) and
\(\mathbf{E}=-\nabla\phi\), we have

\[
qE_z = e\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z} = \frac{\gamma k_B T_e}{n}\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}
\]

Electrons are so mobile that their heat conductivity is almost infinite.
We may then assume isothermal electrons and take \(\gamma = 1\).
Integrating, we have

\[
e\phi = k_B T_e \ln n + C
\]

or

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:boltzmann_relation}{}{
n = n_0 \exp(e\phi/k_B T_e)
}\label{eq:boltzmann_relation}\end{equation}

This is just the \emph{Boltzmann relation} for electrons.

What this means physically is that electrons, being light, are very
mobile and would be accelerated to high energies very quickly if there
were a net force on them. Since electrons cannot leave a region en masse
without leaving behind a large ion charge, the electrostatic and
pressure gradient forces on the electrons must be closely in balance.
This condition leads to the Boltzmann relation. Note that
Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann_relation} \emph{applies to each magnetic
field lines separately}. Different field lines may be charged to
different potentials arbitrarily unless a mechanism is provided for the
electrons to move across \(\mathbf{B}\). The conductors on which field
lines terminate can provide such a mechanism, and the experimentalist
has to take these end effects into account carefully.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:boltzmann_relation}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/boltzmann_relation.png}
\caption{Physical reason for the Boltzmann relation between density and
potential.}\label{fig:boltzmann_relation}
}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:boltzmann_relation} shows graphically what occurs when
there is a local density clump in the plasma. Let the density gradient
be toward the center of the diagram, and suppose \(k_B T\) is constant.
There is then a pressure gradient toward the center. Since the plasma is
quasineutral, the gradient exists for both the electron and ion fluids.
Consider the pressure gradient force \(\mathbf{F}_p\) on the electron
fluid. It drives the mobile electrons away from the center, leaving the
ions behind. The resulting positive charge generates a field
\(\mathbf{E}\) whose force \(\mathbf{F}_E\) on the electrons opposes
\(\mathbf{F}_p\). Only when \(\mathbf{F}_E = -\mathbf{F}_p\) is a steady
state achieved. If \(\mathbf{B}\) is a constant, \(\mathbf{E}\) is an
electrostatic field \(\mathbf{E}=-\nabla\phi\), and \(\phi\) must be
large at the center, where \(n\) is large. This is just what
Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann_relation} tells us. The deviation from stric
neutrality adjusts itself so that there is just enough charge to set up
the \(\mathbf{E}\) field required to balance the forces on the
electrons.

\hypertarget{sec:plasma_approximation}{%
\section{The Plasma Approximation}\label{sec:plasma_approximation}}

The previous example reveals an important characteristic of plasmas that
has wide application. We are used to solving for \(\mathbf{E}\) from
Poisson's equation when we are given the charge density \(\sigma\). In a
plasma, the opposite procedure is generally used. \(\mathbf{E}\) is
found from the equations of motion, and Poisson's equation is used only
to find \(\sigma\). The reason is that a plasma has an overriding
tendency to remain neutral. If the ions move, the electrons will follow.
\(\mathbf{E}\) must adjust itself so that the orbits of the electrons
and ions preserve neutrality. The charge density is of secondary
importance; it will adjust itself so that Poisson's equation is
satisfied. This is true, of course, only for low-frequency motions in
which the electron inertia is not a factor.

In a plasma, it is usually possible to assume \(n_i=n_e\) and
\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}\neq 0\) at the same time. We shall call this the
\emph{plasma approximation}. It is a fundamental trait of plasmas, one
which is difficult for the novice to understand. \emph{Do not use
Poisson's equation to obtain \(\mathbf{E}\) unless it is unavoidable}!
In the set of fluid equations Equation~\ref{eq:fluid_set}, we may now
eliminate Poisson's equation and also eliminate one of the unknowns by
setting \(n_i = n_e = n\).

The \emph{plasma approximation} is almost the same as the condition of
quasineutrality discussed earlier but has a more exact meaning. Whereas
quasineutrality refers to a general tendency for a plasma to be neutral
in its state of rest, the plasma approximation is a mathematical
shortcut that one can use even for wave motions. As long as these
motions are slow enough that both ions and electrons have time to move,
it is a good approximation to replace Poisson's equation by the equation
\(n_i=n_e\). Of course, if only one species can move and the other
cannot follow, such as in high-frequency electron waves, then the plasma
approximation is not valid, and \(\mathbf{E}\) must be found from
Maxwell's Equation~\ref{eq:maxwell_vacuum} rather than from the ion and
electron equations of motion. Ampere's law with the displacement current
retained gives the time evolution of \({bf E}\):

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\left( \frac{\nabla\times\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0} - \mathbf{j} \right)
\]

We shall return to the question of the validity of the plasma
approximation when we come to the theory of ion waves. At that time, it
will become clear why we had to use Poisson's equation in the derivation
of Debye shielding. For electron waves, we can also show that with a
simple ``modified'' electron test particle model that updates the
electric field while keeping the magnetic field constant, we can retain
the plasma oscillation and electron Berstein wave.

\hypertarget{sec:2fluid}{%
\section{Two-Fluid Model}\label{sec:2fluid}}

Besides the Vlasov theory, we can apply the simpler but equally powerful
2-fluid model, in which electrons and ions are treated as two different
fluids. Depending on the form of the pressure term, we have the
5/6/10-moment equations.

\hypertarget{six-moment}{%
\subsection{Six-moment}\label{six-moment}}

For monatomic gases, the six-moment equations for all charged fluids
(indexed by \(s\)) can be written as:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:6-moment-fluids}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \rho_s}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\rho_s\mathbf{u}_s) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial (\rho_s\mathbf{u}_s)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left[ \rho_s\mathbf{u}_s\mathbf{u}_s + p_{s\perp}\pmb{I} + (p_{s\parallel} - p_{s\perp})\hat{b}\hat{b} \right] = \frac{q_s}{m_s}\rho_s(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u}_s\times\mathbf{B}) \\
\frac{\partial p_{s\parallel}}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(p_{s\parallel}\mathbf{u}_s) = -2p_{s\parallel}\hat{b}\cdot(\hat{b}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_s \\
\frac{\partial p_{s\perp}}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(p_{s\perp}\mathbf{u}_s) = -p_{s\perp}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_s) + p_{s\perp}\hat{b}\cdot(\hat{b}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_s
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:6-moment-fluids}\end{equation}

The two pressure equations in Equation~\ref{eq:6-moment-fluids} can be
combined to give the equation for the average pressure
\(p=(2p_\perp + p_\parallel)/3\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:6-moment_average_p}{}{
\frac{\partial p_s}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(p_s\mathbf{u}_s) = (p_s - p_{s\parallel})\hat{b}\cdot(\hat{b}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_s - \left( p_s - \frac{p_{s\parallel}}{3} \right)\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_s
}\label{eq:6-moment_average_p}\end{equation}

Alternatively, we can solve for the hydrodynamic energy density
\(e = \frac{n\mathbf{u}^2}{2} + \frac{3}{2}p\) for each species:

\[
\frac{\partial e_s}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left[ \mathbf{u}_s(e_s+p_s) + \mathbf{u}_s\cdot(p_{s\parallel} - p_{s\perp})\hat{b}\hat{b} \right] = \frac{q_s}{m_s}\rho_s \mathbf{u}_s\cdot\mathbf{E}
\]

which is more of a conservative form and can be beneficial to get better
jump conditions across shock waves. Note, however, that the parallel
pressure equation is still solved with the adiabatic assumption, so
non-adiabatic heating is not properly captured. In addition, the
magnetic energy is not included into the energy density, so the jump
conditions are only approximate (I think this is more of a numerical
consideration). In general, there can be many more source terms on the
right hand sides of the above equations corresponding to gravity, charge
exchange, chemical reactions, collisions, etc.

The electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) and magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\) are
obtained from Maxwell's equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} + \nabla\times\mathbf{E} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} - c^2\nabla\times\mathbf{B} &= -c^2\mu_0\mathbf{j} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho_c}{\epsilon_0} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\rho_c = \sum_s (q_s/m_s)\rho_s\) is the total charge density
and \(\mathbf{j}=\sum_s(q_s/m_s)\rho_s\mathbf{u}_s\) is the current
density.

The last two equations are constraints on the initial conditions; these
are not guaranteed to hold numerically. Classical tricks involves using
hyperbolic/parabolic cleaning or a facially-collocated Yee-type mesh.

\hypertarget{fiveten-moment}{%
\subsection{Five/Ten-moment}\label{fiveten-moment}}

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-wang2020exact}{Wang et al., 2020})

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial(m_s n_s)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(m_sn_su_{j,s})}{\partial x_j} = 0 \\
\frac{\partial(m_s n_s u_{j,s})}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}_{ij,s}}{\partial x_j} = n_s q_s (E_i + \epsilon_{ijk}u_{j,s}B_k)
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\epsilon_{ijk}\) is the Levi-Civita symbol. The moments are
defined as

\[
\begin{aligned}
n_s(\mathbf{x}) &\equiv \int f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \\
u_{i,s}(\mathbf{x}) &\equiv \frac{1}{n_s(\mathbf{x})}\int v_i f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \\
\mathcal{P}_{ij,s}(\mathbf{x}) &\equiv m_s \int v_i v_j f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}
\end{aligned}
\]

with \(f_s(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t)\) being the phase space distribution
function. We will neglect the subscript \(s\) hereinafter for
convenience. For completeness, \(\mathcal{P}_{ij}\) relates to the more
familiar thermal pressure tensor

\[
P_{ij} \equiv m\int(v_i - u_i)(v_i - u_i)f\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}
\]

by

\[
\mathcal{P}_{ij} = P_{ij} + nm u_i u_j
\]

For simplicity, non-ideal effects like viscous dissipation are
neglected. The electric and magnetic fields \(\mathbf{E}\) and
\(\mathbf{B}\) are evolved using Maxwell equations

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} + \nabla\times\mathbf{E} = 0 \\
\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t} - c^2\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sum_s q_s n_s \mathbf{u}_s
\end{aligned}
\]

with \(c=1/\sqrt(\mu_0\epsilon_0)\) being the speed of light.

To close the system, the second order moment \(\mathcal{P}_{ij}\) or
\(P_{ij}\) must be specified. For example, a cold fluid closure simply
sets \(P_{ij}=0\), while an isothermal equation of state (EOS) assumes
that the temperature is constant. Or, assuming zero heat flux and that
the pressure tensor is isotropic, we can write an adiabatic EOS for
\(P_{ij} = p I_{ij}\),

\[
\frac{\partial\mathcal{\epsilon}}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left[ (p+\mathcal{\epsilon})\mathbf{u} \right] = nq\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{E}
\]

where

\[
\mathcal{\epsilon} \equiv \frac{p}{\gamma-1} + \frac{1}{2}mn\mathbf{u}^2
\]

is the total fluid (thermal + kinetic) energy and \(\gamma\) is the
adiabatic index, setting to \(5/3\) for a fully ionized plasma. For a
plasma with \(S\) species (\(s=1,...,S\)) this system is closed and has
a total of \(5S+6\) equations, and are here referred to as the
\emph{five-moment} model. More general models can be obtained by
retaining the evolution equations for all six components of the pressure
tensor in the so-called \emph{ten-moment} model

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ten-moment}{}{
\frac{\mathcal{P}_{ij,s}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \mathcal{Q}_{ijm,s}}{\partial x_m} = n_sq_su_{i,s}E_j + \frac{q_s}{m_s}\epsilon_{iml}\mathcal{P}_{mj,s}B_l
}\label{eq:ten-moment}\end{equation}

where the third moment

\[
\mathcal{Q}_{ijm,s}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv m_s\int v_i v_j v_m f_s\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}
\]

relates to the heat flux tensor defined in the fluid frame

\[
Q_{ijm} \equiv m\int (v_i-u_i)(v_j-u_j)(v_m-u_m)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}
\]

by

\[
\mathcal{Q}_{ijm} = Q_{ijm} + u_i\mathcal{P}_{jm} - 2nm u_i u_j u_m
\]

Again, the equations here must be closed by some approximation for the
heat-flux tensor. Another option is to include evolution equations for
even higher order moments, e.g., the ten independent components of the
heat-flux tensor.

Theoretically, the multifluid-Maxwell equations approach the Hall
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) under asymptotic limits of vanishing electron
mass (\(m_e \rightarrow 0\)) and infinite speed of light
(\(c\rightarrow\infty\)). All waves and effects within the two-fluid
picture are retained, for example, the light wave, electron and ion
inertial effects like the ion cyclotron wave and whistler wave.
Particularly, through properly devised heat-flux closures, the
ten-moment model could partially capture nonlocal kinetic effects like
Landau damping, in a manner similar to the gyrofluid (?) models.

Although multifluid-Maxwell models provide a more complete description
of the plasma than reduced, asymptotic models like MHD, they are less
frequently used. The reason for this is the fast kinetic scales
involved. Retaining the electron inertia adds plasma-frequency and
cyclotron time-scale, while non-neutrality adds Debye length
spatial-scales. Further, inclusion of the displacement currents means
that EM waves must be resolved when using an explicit scheme.
Fortunately, the restrictions due to kinetic scales are introduced
\emph{only through the non-hyperbolic source terms} of the momentum
equation, the Ampère's law, and the pressure equation. Therefore we may
eliminate these restrictions by \emph{updating the source term
separately either exactly} or \emph{using an implicit algorithm} (Note:
BATSRUS applies the point-implicit scheme.). This allows larger time
steps and leads to significant speedup, especially with realistic
electron/ion mass ratios. The speed of light constraint still exists,
however, can be greatly relaxed, using reduced values for the speed of
light and/or sub-cycling Maxwell equations. Of course, an implicit
Maxwell solver, or a reduced set of electromagnetic equations like the
Darwin approximation (???), can also relax the time-step restrictions.

\hypertarget{characteristic-wave-speeds}{%
\subsection{Characteristic wave
speeds}\label{characteristic-wave-speeds}}

The fastest wave speed in the 5/6/10-moment equations is the speed of
light \(c\). Theoretically, the characteristic wave speeds shall be
consistent and fallback to MHD in the isotropic 5-moment case.

Numerically, however, using \(c\) in the numerical fluxes makes the
scheme rather diffusive (?). The discretization time step is limited by
the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition based on the speed of light.
In practice, we can reduce the speed of light to a value that is a
factor of 2-3 faster than the fastest flow and fast wave speed to speed
up the simulation.

\hypertarget{electrostatic-wave-dispersion-relation}{%
\subsection{Electrostatic wave dispersion
relation}\label{electrostatic-wave-dispersion-relation}}

The general procedure of obtaining the dispersion relation for
electrostatic wave is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Get the linear equations from governing equations.
\item
  Get the relation between linearized velocity and perturbed electric
  field.
\item
  Get the relation between linearized density and perturbed electric
  field.
\item
  Get the current response to the perturbed electric field.
\item
  Get the dielectric tensor from Maxwell's equation. Let
  \(|\pmb{\epsilon}|=0\). we finally obtain the dispersion relation. For
  an isotropic case, the dielectric tensor shrinks to a scalar, so we
  simply have \(\epsilon=0\).
\end{enumerate}

Assume the simple equilibrium state in 1D (static and ``cold'' ions,
``cold'' electrons):
\(m_i=\infty,E_0=B_0=0, p_i=p_e=0, n_i = n_0, T_e=T_i=0\). Whenever we
say ``cold'' for plasma, it does not mean that the plasma is at absolute
zero degree. This only means that we are considering a situation where
the kinetic pressure plays no roles in the dispersion relation. This is
also a \emph{non-magnetized plasma} because \(\mathbf{B_0} = 0\). The
variables including perturbations are

\[
\begin{aligned}
n_e &= n_0+n_1 \quad n_0\gg n_1\\
v_e &= v_0+v_1 \quad v_0\gg v_1 \\
E &= \cancel{E}_0 +E_1 \\
n_1(x,t)&=\tilde{n}_1e^{-i\omega t+ikx}
\end{aligned}
\]

The electron continuity and the momentum equations read

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(n_0+n_1)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\big[(n_0+n_1)(v_0+v_1)\big]=0 \\
&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(v_0+v_1)+(v_0+v_1)\frac{\partial(v_0+v_1)}{\partial x}=-\frac{e}{m_e}\big[ (E_0+E_1)+(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1)\times(\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{B}_1)_x \big]
\end{aligned}
\]

Again, for electrostatic waves, \(\mathbf{B}_1=0\). Neglecting high
order terms, we get the linearized equations

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(n_0 v_1)+\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(n_1v_0)&=0 \\
\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial t}+v_0\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}&=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1
\end{aligned}
\]

Assume wave-like perturbations \(e^{ikx-i\omega t}\) as in the Vlasov
theory, from the linearized momentum equation we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
(-i\omega+ikv_0)v_1&=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1 \\
\Rightarrow v_1&=\frac{\frac{e}{m_e}E_1}{i(\omega-kv_0)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting into the linear continuity equation, we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega n_1+ikn_0v_1+ikn_1v_0=0 \\
\Rightarrow n_1=\frac{kn_0v_1}{\omega-kv_0}=\frac{kn_0}{\omega-kv_0}\frac{\frac{e}{m_e}E_1}{i(\omega-kv_0)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

This is the density perturbation in response to electric perturbation
\(E_1\) in 2-fluid theory.

Then we can use the Poisson's equation to generate the dielectric
function

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}_1)+en_1\equiv\nabla\cdot(\epsilon \mathbf{E}_1)=0 \\
ik\epsilon_0 \tilde{E}_1+e\tilde{n}_1=ik\epsilon \tilde{E}_1 \\
\Rightarrow \epsilon=\epsilon_0 \Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\omega-kv_0)^2} \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

which is the same as the result given by Vlasov theory (Y.Y. Problem Set
\#6.2). The advantage of using 2-fluid method is that we do not need to
consider velocity space, which simplifies the derivation.

If we have two streams of electron described by \(g(v)\) as

\[
\begin{aligned}
g(v)=\frac{1}{2}\big[ \delta(v-v_1)+\delta(v-v_2) \big]
\end{aligned}
\]

with the oscillation frequency \(\omega_{p1},\omega_{p2}\) and number
density \(n_{p1,1},n_{p2,1}\) respectively. In consideration of linear
superposition property, we expect the dielectric function to be

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{p1}}^2}{(\omega-kv_1)^2}-\frac{{\omega_{p2}}^2}{(\omega-kv_2)^2}
\]

If \(g(v)\) is a continuous distribution in general,
\(g(v)=\sum_j g_j(v)\), then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_j \frac{{\omega_{p,j}}^2 g_j(v)\mathrm{d}v}{(\omega-kv)^2} \\ &=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{g(v)\mathrm{d}v}{(v-\omega/k)^2}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that \(\delta^\prime(x) = x^{-1}\delta(x)\). Here we reconstruct
the result of Vlasov theory from 2-fluid theory. The equivalence of the
two approaches is explored more thoroughly in later section Fluid
Descriptions of Kinetic Modes (ADD LINK!).

Then what happens if ion motion is included? We still have ``cold'' ions
at rest in equilibrium but now with ion perturbations in density. The
Poisson's equation should include ion density perturbation

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E}_1)&=\sum_{j=i,e} q_j n_{1j} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}v \frac{\partial g_e(v)/\partial v}{v-\omega/k}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}v \frac{\partial g_i(v)/\partial v}{v-\omega/k}
\end{aligned}
\]

In the simplest equilibrium case,
\(g_e(v)=\delta(v-v_0),\ g_i(v)=\delta(v)\)

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\omega-kv_0)^2}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}
\]

Let \(\epsilon=0\), we get the dispersion relation \(\omega=\omega(k)\).
An example dispersion relation and dielectric function property are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2stream_dispersion} and
Figure~\ref{fig:2stream_dielectric}, respectively. Note that if you have
a real wave number \(k\), you will get a pair of conjugate \(\omega\),
one of which that lies between \(0\) and \(kv_0\) is an unstable mode.
This will exhibit 2-stream instability as shown by the velocity space
distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:2stream_velocity}.

Let \(\omega/\omega_{pe}=z,\ \frac{kv_0}{\omega_{pe}}=\lambda\), such
that \(z\) and \(\lambda\) are dimensionless numbers. Let the right-hand

\[
f(z)=\frac{1}{(z-\lambda)^2}+\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2/{\omega_{pe}}^2}{z^2}=\frac{z^2+(z-\lambda)^2 \omega_{pi}^2/{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(z-\lambda)^2z^2}

We can plot \(f\) to find the threshold of \(k\) when the instability
will happen. See Y.Y's Problem Set 6.3 for details.

\hypertarget{hall-mhd}{%
\section{Hall MHD}\label{hall-mhd}}

As an extension to the ideal/resistive MHD model, Hall MHD decouples the
electron and ion motions by retrieving the Hall term in the generalized
Ohm's law

\[
\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}+\eta\mathbf{J}+\frac{1}{en}\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} - \frac{\nabla p_e}{ne}
\]

where the first term on the right-hand-side is the convective term, the
second is the resistive term, the third is the Hall term, and the fourth
is the electron pressure gradient term. The electron pressure scalar is
simplified from the electron pressure tensor, which is obtained from an
independent electron pressure equation.

The Hall MHD equations are

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:hall_mhd}{}{

\frac{\partial e}{\partial t}&=-\nabla\cdot\left[ \left(\epsilon+p\right)\mathbf{u} +(\epsilon_e + p_e)\mathbf{u}_e+\mathbf{u}_e\cdot\left(\frac{\mathbf{B}^2}{\mu_0}\bar{\bar{I}}-\frac{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0}\right) - \mathbf{B}\times\eta\mathbf{j} \right] \\

\frac{\partial p_e}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \left(p_e\mathbf{u}_e \right)&=-(\gamma-1)p_e\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_e
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:hall_mhd}\end{equation}

where \(\bar{\bar{I}}\) is the identity matrix, \(\rho\) is the mass
density, \(\mathbf{u}\) is the plasma bulk velocity, \(\mathbf{B}\) is
the magnetic field, \(p_e\) is the electron pressure, \(p\) is the ion
thermal pressure, \(\mathbf{j}=\nabla\times\mathbf{B}/\mu_0\) is the
current density, \(\epsilon=\rho\mathbf{u}^2/2\) is the hydrodynamic
energy density, and \(\epsilon_e=\rho\mathbf{u}_e^2/2\) is the electron
hydrodynamic energy density. The Hall velocity is defined as

\[
\mathbf{v}_H=-\frac{\mathbf{j}}{ne}
\]

and the electron bulk velocity is given by

\[
\mathbf{u}_e = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}_H

The total energy density is (I may have a coefficient error here for
\(p_e\)!)

\[
e= \frac{1}{2}\rho \mathbf{u}^2+\frac{1}{\gamma-1}(p+p_e)+\frac{\mathbf{B}^2}{2\mu_0}

\section{Diffusion and Mobility in Weakly Ionized
Gases}\label{diffusion-and-mobility-in-weakly-ionized-gases}}

The infinite, homogeneous plasmas assumed in the previous chapter for
the equilibrium conditions are, of course, highly idealized. Any
realistic plasma will have a density gradient, and the plasma will tend
to diffuse toward regions of low density. For example, the central
problem in controlled thermonuclear reactions is to impede the rate of
diffusion by using a magnetic field. Before tackling the magnetic field
problem, however, we shall consider the case of diffusion in the absence
of magnetic fields. A further simplification results if we assume that
the plasma is weakly ionized, so that charge particles collide primarily
with neutral atoms rather than with one another. The case of a fully
ionized plasma is deferred to a later section, since it results in a
nonlinear equation for which there are few simple illustrative
solutions. In any case, partially ionized gases are not rare:
High-pressure arcs and ionospheric plasmas fall into this category, and
most of the early work on gas discharges involved fractional ionizations
between \(10^3\) and \(10^6\), when collisions with neutral atoms are
dominant.

The picture, then, is of a nonuniform distribution of ions and electrons
in a dense background of neutrals (Fig. 5.1 ADD IT!). As the plasma
spreads out as a result of pressure-gradient and electric field forces,
the individual particles undergo a random walk, colliding frequently
with the neutral atoms. We begin with a brief review of definitions from
atomic theory.

\hypertarget{collision-parameters}{%
\section{Collision Parameters}\label{collision-parameters}}

When an electron, say, collides with a neutral atom, it may lose any
fraction of its initial momentum, depending on the angle at which it
rebounds. In a head-on collision with a heavy atom, the electron can
lose twice its initial momentum, since its velocity reverses sign after
the collision. The probability of momentum loss can be expressed in
terms of the equivalent cross section \(\sigma\) that the atoms would
have if they were perfect absorbers of momentum.

In Fig. 5.2, electrons are incident upon a slab of area \(A\) and
thickness \(\mathrm{d}x\) containing \(n_n\) neutral atoms per
\(\text{m}^3\). The atoms are imagined to be opaque spheres of
cross-sectional area \(\sigma\); that is, every time an electron comes
within the area blocked by the atom, the electron loses all of its
momentum. The number of atoms in the slab is \(n_n A \mathrm{d}x\). The
fraction of the slab blocked by atoms is
\(n_n A\sigma \mathrm{d}x / A = n_n \sigma \mathrm{d}x\). If a flux
\(\Gamma\) of electrons is incident on the slab, the flux emerging on
the other side is \(\Gamma^\prime = \Gamma(1-n_n \sigma \mathrm{d}x)\).
Thus the change of \(\Gamma\) with distance is
\(\mathrm{d}\Gamma/\mathrm{d}x = -n_n \sigma\Gamma\), or

\[
\Gamma = \Gamma_0 e^{-n_n\sigma x} \equiv \Gamma_0 e^{-x/\lambda_m}
\]

In a distance \(\lambda_m\), the flux would be decreased to \(1/e\) of
its initial value. The quantity \(\lambda_m\) is the \emph{mean free
path} for collisions:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mean_free_path_collision}{}{
\lambda_m = 1/n_n\sigma
}\label{eq:mean_free_path_collision}\end{equation}

After traveling a distance \(\lambda_m\), a particle will have had a
good probability of making a collision. The mean time between
collisions, for particles of velocity \(v\), is given by

\[
\tau = \lambda_m/v
\]

and the mean frequency of collisions is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mean_freq_collision}{}{
\tau^{-1} = v/\lambda_m = n_n \sigma v
}\label{eq:mean_freq_collision}\end{equation}

If we now average over particles of all velocities \(v\) in a Maxwellian
distribution, we have what is generally called the collision frequency
\(\nu\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:collision_freq}{}{
\nu = n_n \overline{\sigma v}
}\label{eq:collision_freq}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{diffusion-parameters}{%
\section{Diffusion Parameters}\label{diffusion-parameters}}

The fluid equation of motion including collisions is, for any species
\(s\),

\[
mn\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = mn \Big[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v} \Big] = q_sn\mathbf{E} - \nabla p - mn\nu\mathbf{v}
\]

The averaging process used to compute \(\nu\) is such as to make the
last equation correct; we need not be concerned with the details of this
computation. The quantity \(\nu\) must, however, be assumed to be a
constant in order for the equation to be useful. We shall consider a
steady state in which \(\partial\mathbf{v}/\partial t\) = 0. If
\(\mathbf{v}\) is sufficiently small (or \(\nu\) sufficiently large), a
fluid element will not move into regions of different \(\mathbf{E}\) and
\(\nabla p\) in a collision time, and the convective derivative
\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}/\mathrm{d}t\) will also vanish. Setting the
left-hand side to zero, we have, for an isothermal plasma,

\[
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{mn\nu}(q_sn\mathbf{E} - k_B T \nabla n) = \frac{q_s}{m\nu}\mathbf{E} - \frac{k_B T}{mv}\frac{\nabla n}{n}
\]

The coefficients above are called the \emph{mobility} and the
\emph{diffusion coefficient}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mobility}{}{
\mu\equiv |q|/m\nu\quad\text{Mobility}
}\label{eq:mobility}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diffusion_coef}{}{
D\equiv k_B T/ m\nu\quad\text{Diffusion coefficient}
}\label{eq:diffusion_coef}\end{equation}

These will be different for each species. Note that \(D\) is measured in
\(\text{m}^2/s\). The transport coefficients \(\mu\) and \(D\) are
connected by the \emph{Einstein relation}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:einstein_relation}{}{
\mu = |q|D/k_B T
}\label{eq:einstein_relation}\end{equation}

With the help of these definitions, the flux \(\Gamma_s\) of the sth
species can be written

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:species_flux}{}{
\Gamma_s = n\mathbf{v}_s = \pm \mu_s n\mathbf{E} - D_s\nabla n
}\label{eq:species_flux}\end{equation}

\emph{Fick's law} of diffusion is a special case of this, occurring when
either \(\mathbf{E}=0\) or the particles are uncharged, so that
\(\mu=0\):

\[
\Gamma = -D\nabla n\quad\text{Fick's law}
\]

This equation merely expresses the fact that diffusion is a random-walk
process, in which a net flux from dense regions to less dense regions
occurs simply because more particles start in the dense region. This
flux is obviously proportional to the gradient of the density. In
plasmas, Fick's law is not necessarily obeyed. Because of the
possibility of organized motions (plasma waves), a plasma may spread out
in a manner which is not truly random.

\hypertarget{decay-of-a-plasma-by-diffusion}{%
\section{Decay of a Plasma by
Diffusion}\label{decay-of-a-plasma-by-diffusion}}

\hypertarget{ambipolar-diffusion}{%
\subsection{Ambipolar Diffusion}\label{ambipolar-diffusion}}

We now consider how a plasma created in a container decays by diffusion
to the walls. Once ions and electrons reach the wall, they recombine
there. The density near the wall, therefore, is essentially zero. The
fluid equations of motion and continuity govern the plasma behavior; but
if the decay is slow, we need only keep the time derivative in the
continuity equation. The time derivative in the equation of motion, will
be negligible if the collision frequency \(\nu\) is large. We thus have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diffusion_continuity}{}{
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\Gamma_s = 0
}\label{eq:diffusion_continuity}\end{equation}

with \(\Gamma_s\) given by Equation~\ref{eq:species_flux}. It is clear
that if \(\Gamma_i\) and \(\Gamma_e\) were not equal, a serious charge
imbalance would soon arise. If the plasma is much larger than a Debye
length, it must be quasineutral; and one would expect that the rates of
diffusion of ions and electrons would somehow adjust themselves so that
the two species leave at the same rate. How this happens is easy to see.
The electrons, being lighter, have higher thermal velocities and tend to
leave the plasma first. A positive charge is left behind, and an
electric field is set up of such a polarity as to retard the loss of
electrons and accelerate the loss of ions. The required \(\mathbf{E}\)
field is found by setting \(\Gamma_i=\Gamma_e=\Gamma\). From
@Equation~\ref{eq:species_flux}, we can write

\[
\Gamma = \mu_i n\mathbf{E} - D_i \nabla n = -\mu_e n\mathbf{E} - D_e\nabla n
\]

\[
\mathbf{E} = \frac{D_i - D_e}{\mu_i + \mu_e}\frac{\nabla n}{n}
\]

The common flux \(\Gamma\) is then given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma &= \mu_i\frac{D_i - D_e}{\mu_i + \mu_e}\nabla n - D_i \nabla n \\
&=\frac{\mu_iD_i - \mu_iD_e - \mu_iD_i - \mu_eD_i}{\mu_i + \mu_e}\nabla n \\
&=-\frac{\mu_iD_e + \mu_eD_i}{\mu_i+\mu_e}\nabla n
\end{aligned}
\]

This is Fick's law with a new diffusion coefficient

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ambipolar_diffusion_coef}{}{
D_a \equiv \frac{\mu_iD_e + \mu_eD_i}{\mu_i+\mu_e}
}\label{eq:ambipolar_diffusion_coef}\end{equation}

called the \emph{ambipolar diffusion coefficient}. If this is constant,
the continuity equation above becomes simply

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ambipolar_diffusion}{}{
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = D_a \nabla^2 n
}\label{eq:ambipolar_diffusion}\end{equation}

The magnitude of Da can be estimated if we take \(\mu_e\gg\mu_i\). That
this is true can be seen from Equation~\ref{eq:mobility}. Since \(\nu\)
is proportional to the thermal velocity, which is proportional to
\(m^{-1/2}\), \(\mu\) is proportional to \(m^{-1/2}\).
Equation~\ref{eq:mobility} and
Equation~\ref{eq:ambipolar_diffusion_coef} then give

\[
D_a \approx D_i + \frac{\mu_i}{\mu_e}D_e = D_i + \frac{T_e}{T_i}D_i
\]

For \(T_e = T_i\), we have

\[
D_a \approx 2D_i
\]

The effect of the ambipolar electric field is to enhance the diffusion
of ions by a factor of two, and the diffusion rate of the two species
together is primarily controlled by the slower species.

\hypertarget{diffusion-in-a-slab}{%
\subsection{Diffusion in a Slab}\label{diffusion-in-a-slab}}

The diffusion Equation~\ref{eq:ambipolar_diffusion} can easily be solved
by the method of separation of variables. We let

\[
n(\mathbf{r}, t) = T(t)S(\mathbf{r})
\]

whereupon Equation~\ref{eq:ambipolar_diffusion}, with the subscript on
\(D_a\) understood, becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
S\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} &= DT\nabla^2 S \\
\frac{1}{T}\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{D}{S}\nabla^2 S
\end{aligned}
\]

Since the left side is a function of time alone and the right side a
function of space alone, they must both be equal to the same constant,
which we shall call \(-1/\tau\). The function \(T\) then obeys the
equation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diffusion_temporal}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{T}{\tau}
}\label{eq:diffusion_temporal}\end{equation}

with the solution

\[
T = T_0 e^{-t/\tau}
\]

The spatial part \(S\) obeys the equation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diffusion_spatial}{}{
\nabla^2 S = -\frac{1}{D\tau} S
}\label{eq:diffusion_spatial}\end{equation}

In slab geometry, this becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diffusion_spatial_slab}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 S}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\frac{1}{D\tau}S
}\label{eq:diffusion_spatial_slab}\end{equation}

with the solution

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:slab_sol}{}{
S = A\cos\frac{x}{(D\tau)^{1/2}} + B\sin\frac{x}{(D\tau)^{1/2}}
}\label{eq:slab_sol}\end{equation}

We would expect the density to be nearly zero at the walls (Fig. 5.3 ADD
IT!) and to have one or more peaks in between. The simplest solution is
that with a single maximum. By symmetry, we can reject the odd (sine)
term in Equation~\ref{eq:slab_sol}. The boundary conditions \(S=0\) at
\(x=\pm L\) then requires

\[
\frac{L}{(D\tau)^{1/2}} = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

or

\[
\tau = \Big( \frac{2L}{\pi} \Big)^2 \frac{1}{D}
\]

Combining all the equations above, we have

\[
n = n_0 e^{-t/\tau} \cos\frac{\pi x}{2L}
\]

This is called the \emph{lowest diffusion mode}. The density
distribution is a cosine, and the peak density decays exponentially with
time. The time constant \(\tau\) increases with \(L\) and varies
inversely with \(D\), as one would expect.

There are, of course, higher diffusion modes with more than one peak.
Suppose the initial density distribution is as shown by the top curve in
Fig. 5.4 ADD IT. Such an arbitrary distribution can be expanded in a
Fourier series:

\[
n = n_0 \Big( \sum_l a_l\cos\frac{(l+\frac{1}{2})\pi x}{L} \sum_m b_m\sin\frac{m\pi x}{L} \Big)
\]

We have chosen the indices so that the boundary condition at \(x=\pm L\)
is automatically satisfied. To treat the time dependence, we can try a
solution of the form

\[
n = n_0 \Big( \sum_l a_l e^{-t/\tau_l}\cos\frac{(l+\frac{1}{2})\pi x}{L} \sum_m b_m e^{-t/\tau_m}\sin\frac{m\pi x}{L} \Big)
\]

Substituting this into the diffusion
Equation~\ref{eq:ambipolar_diffusion}, we see that each cosine term
yields a relation of the form

\[
-\frac{1}{\tau_l} = -D\Big[ \Big(l+\frac{\pi}{2}\Big)\frac{\pi}{L} \Big]^2
\]

and similarly for the sine terms. Thus the decay time constant for the
\(l\)th mode is given by

\[
\tau_l = \Big[ \frac{L}{(l+\frac{1}{2})\pi} \Big]^2 \frac{1}{D}
\]

The fine-grained structure of the density distribution, corresponding to
large \(l\) numbers, decays faster, with a smaller time constant
\(\tau_l\). The plasma decay will proceed as indicated in Fig. 5.4 ADD
IT. First, the fine structure will be washed out by diffusion. Then the
lowest diffusion mode, the simple cosine distribution of Fig. 5.3 ADD
IT, will be reached. Finally, the peak density continues to decay while
the plasma density profile retains the same shape.

I WANT TO DO A SIMULATION ON THIS! TRY METHODOFLINES.JL?

\hypertarget{diffusion-in-a-cylinder}{%
\subsection{Diffusion in a Cylinder}\label{diffusion-in-a-cylinder}}

The spatial part of the diffusion equation, eq:diffusion\_spatial,
reads, in cylindrical geometry,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diffusion_spatial_cylinder}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 S}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{dS}{dr} + \frac{1}{D\tau}S = 0
}\label{eq:diffusion_spatial_cylinder}\end{equation}

This differs from Equation~\ref{eq:diffusion_spatial_slab} by the
addition of the middle term, which merely accouts for the change in
coordinates. The need for the extra term is illustrated simply in Fig.
5.5 ADD IT. If a slice of plasma in (a) is moved toward larger x without
being allowed to expand, the density would remain constant. On the other
hand, if a shell of plasma in (b) is moved toward larger \(r\) with the
shell thickness kept constant, the density would necessarily decrease as
\(1/r\). Consequently, one would expect the solution to
Equation~\ref{eq:diffusion_spatial_cylinder} to be like a damped cosine
(Fig. 5.6 ADD IT). This function is called a \emph{Bessel function of
order zero}, and eq:diffusion\_spatial\_cylinder is called Bessel's
equation (of order zero). Instead of the symbol cos, it is given the
symbol \(J_0\). The function \(J0(r/[D\tau]^{1/2})\) is a solution to
eq:diffusion\_spatial\_cylinder, just as
\(\cos[x/(\mathrm{d}\tau)^{1/2}]\) is a solution to
eq:diffusion\_spatial. Both \(\cos kx\) and \(J_0(kr)\) are expressible
in terms of infinite series.

FIGURE: Motion of a plasma slab in rectilinear and cylindrical geometry,
illustrating the difference between a cosine and a Bessel function.

To satisfy the boundary condition \(n=0\) at \(r=a\), we must set
\(a/(D\tau)^{1/2}\) equal to the first zero of \(J_0\); namely, 2.4.
This yields the decay time constant \(\tau\). The plasma again decays
exponentially, since the temporal part of the diffusion equation,
Equation~\ref{eq:diffusion_temporal}, is unchanged. We have described
the lowest diffusion mode in a cylinder. Higher diffusion modes, with
more than one maximum in the cylinder, will be given in terms of Bessel
functions of higher order, in direct analogy to the case of slab
geometry.

\hypertarget{steady-state-solutions}{%
\section{Steady State Solutions}\label{steady-state-solutions}}

In many experiments, a plasma is maintained in a steady state by
continuous ionization or injection of plasma to offset the losses. To
calculate the density profile in this case, we must add a source term to
the equation of continuity:

\[
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} - D\nabla^2 n = Q(\mathbf{r})
\]

The sign is chosen so that when \(Q\) is positive, it represents a
source and contributes to positive \(\partial n/\partial t\). In steady
state, we set \(\partial n/\partial t=0\) and are left with a
Poisson-type equation for \(n(\mathbf{r})\).

\hypertarget{constant-ionization-function}{%
\subsection{Constant Ionization
Function}\label{constant-ionization-function}}

In many weakly ionized gases, ionization is produced by energetic
electrons in the tail of the Maxwellian distribution. In this case, the
source term \(Q\) is proportional to the electron density \(n\). Setting
\(Q=Zn\), where \(Z\) is the ``ionization function'', we have

\[
\nabla^2 n = -(Z/D)n
\]

This is the same equation as that for S,
Equation~\ref{eq:diffusion_spatial}. Consequently, the density profile
is a cosine or Bessel function, as in the case of a decaying plasma,
only in this case the density remains constant. The plasma is maintained
against diffusion losses by whatever heat source keeps the electron
temperature at its constant value and by a small influx of neutral atoms
to replenish those that are ionized.

\hypertarget{plane-source}{%
\subsection{Plane Source}\label{plane-source}}

We next consider what profile would be obtained in slab geometry if
there is a localized source on the plane \(x=0\). Such a source might
be, for instance, a slit-collimated beam of ultraviolet light strong
enough to ionize the neutral gas. The steady state diffusion equation is
then

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^n}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\frac{Q}{D}\delta(0)
\]

Except at \(x=0\), the density must satisfy
\(\partial^2 n/\partial x^2=0\). This obviously has the solution (Fig.
5.7 ADD IT)

\[
n = n_0 \Big( 1-\frac{|x|}{L} \Big)
\]

The plasma has a linear profile. The discontinuity in slope at the
source is characteristic of \(\delta\)-function sources.

\hypertarget{line-source}{%
\subsection{Line Source}\label{line-source}}

Finally, we consider a cylindrical plasma with a source located on the
axis. Such a source might, for instance, be a beam of energetic
electrons producing ionization along the axis. Except at \(r=0\), the
density must satisfy

\[
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\Big(r\frac{\partial n}{\partial r}\Big) = 0
\]

The solution that vanishes at \(r=a\) is

\[
n = n_0 \ln(a/r)
\]

The density becomes infinite at \(r=0\) (Fig. 5.8); it is not possible
to determine the density near the axis accurately without considering
the finite width of the source.

\hypertarget{recombination}{%
\section{Recombination}\label{recombination}}

When an ion and an electron collide, particularly at low relative
velocity, they have a finite probability of recombining into a neutral
atom. To conserve momentum, a third body must be present. If this third
body is an emitted photon, the process is called \emph{radiative
recombination}. If it is a particle, the process is called
\emph{three-body recombination}. The loss of plasma by recombination can
be represented by a negative source term in the equation of continuity.
It is clear that this term will be proportional to \(n_en_i=n^2\). In
the absence of the diffusion terms, the equation of continuity then
becomes

\[
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = -\alpha n^2
\]

The constant of proportionality \(\alpha\) is called the recombination
coefficient and has units of \(\text{m}^3/\text{s}\). This is a
nonlinear equation for \(n\). This means that the straightforward method
for satisfying initial and boundary conditions by linear superposition
of solutions is not available. Fortunately, it is such a simple
nonlinear equation that the solution can be found by inspection. It is

\[
\frac{1}{n(\mathbf{r},t)} = \frac{1}{n_0(\mathbf{r})} + \alpha t
\]

where \(n_0(\mathbf{r})\) is the initial density distribution. After the
density has fallen far below its initial value, it decays
\emph{reciprocally} with time, \(n\propto 1/\alpha t\). This is a
fundamentally different behavior from the case of diffusion, in which
the time variation is exponential.

Figure 5.9 (ADD IT!) shows the results of measurements of the density
decay in the afterglow of a weakly ionized H plasma. When the density is
high, recombination, which is proportional to \(n^2\), is dominant, and
the density decays reciprocally. After the density has reached a low
value, diffusion becomes dominant, and the decay is thenceforth
exponential.

\hypertarget{diffusion-across-a-magnetic-field}{%
\section{Diffusion Across a Magnetic
Field}\label{diffusion-across-a-magnetic-field}}

The rate of plasma loss by diffusion can be decreased by a magnetic
field; this is the problem of confinement in controlled fusion research.
Consider a weakly ionized plasma in a magnetic field
(fig:gyration\_collision ADD IT!). Charged particles will move along
\(\mathbf{B}\) by diffusion and mobility according to
Equation~\ref{eq:species_flux}, since \(\mathbf{B}\) does not affect
motion in the parallel direction. Thus we have, for each species,

\[
\Gamma_z = \pm\mu n E_z - D\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}
\]

If there were no collisions, particles would not diffuse at all in the
perpendicular direction --- they would continue to gyrate about the same
magnetic field line. There are, of course, particle drifts across
\(\mathbf{B}\) because of electric fields or gradients in
\(\mathbf{B}\), but these can be arranged to be parallel to the walls.
For instance, in a perfectly symmetric cylinder (fig:drift\_cylinder ADD
IT!), the gradients are all in the radial direction, so that the guiding
center drifts are in the azimuthal direction. The drifts would then be
harmless.

FIGURE: A charged particle in a magnetic field will gyrate about the
same line of force until it makes a collision. \#fig:gyration\_collision

FIGURE: Particle drifts in a cylindrically symmetric plasma column do
not lead to losses.\#fig:drift\_cylinder

When there are collisions, particles migrate across \(\mathbf{B}\) to
the walls along the gradients. They do this by a random-walk process
(fig:diffusion\_collision\_neutral ADD IT!). When an ion, say, collides
with a neutral atom, the ion leaves the collision traveling in a
different direction. It continues to gyrate about the magnetic field in
the same direction, but its phase of gyration is changed
discontinuously. (The Larmor radius may also change, but let us suppose
that the ion does not gain or lose energy on the average.)

FIGURE: Diffusion of gyrating particles by collisions with neutral
atoms.\#fig:diffusion\_collision\_neutral

The guiding center, therefore, shifts position in a collision and
undergoes a random walk. The particles will diffuse in the direction
opposite \(\nabla n\). The step length in the random walk is no longer
\(\lambda_m\), as in magnetic-field-free diffusion, but has instead the
magnitude of the Larmor radius \(r_L\). Diffusion across \(\mathbf{B}\)
can therefore be slowed down by decreasing \(r_L\); that is, by
increasing B.

To see how this comes about, we write the perpendicular component of the
fluid equation of motion for either species as follows:

\hypertarget{ambipolar-diffusion-across-b}{%
\subsection{Ambipolar Diffusion Across
B}\label{ambipolar-diffusion-across-b}}

Because the diffusion and mobility coefficients are anisotropic in the
presence of a magnetic field, the problem of ambipolar diffusion is not
as straightforward as in the \(B = 0\) case. Consider the particle
fluxes perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\) (Fig. 5.13 ADD IT!). Ordinarily,
since \(\Gamma_{e\perp}\) is smaller than \(\Gamma_{i\perp}\), a
transverse electric field would be set up so as to aid electron
diffusion and retard ion diffusion. However, this electric field can be
short-circuited by an imbalance of the fluxes along \(\mathbf{B}\). That
is, the negative charge resulting from
\(\Gamma_{e\perp} < \Gamma_{i\perp}\) can be dissipated by electrons
escaping along the field lines. Although the total diffusion must be
ambipolar, the perpendicular part of the losses need not be ambipolar.
The ions can diffuse out primarily radially, while the electrons diffuse
out primarily along \(\mathbf{B}\). Whether or not this in fact happens
depends on the particular experiment. In short plasma columns with the
field lines terminating on conducting plates, one would expect the
ambipolar electric field to be short-circuited out. Each species then
diffuses radially at a different rate. In long, thin plasma columns
terminated by insulating plates, one would expect the radial diffusion
to be ambipolar because escape along \(\mathbf{B}\) is arduous.

Mathematically, the problem is to solve simultaneously the continuity
Equation~\ref{eq:diffusion_continuity} for ions and electrons. It is not
the fluxes \(\mathbf{\Gamma}_j\), but the divergence
\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Gamma}_j\) which must be set equal to each other.
Separating \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Gamma}_j\) into perpendicular and
parallel components, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Gamma}_i &= \nabla_\perp\cdot(\mu_i n \mathbf{E}_\perp - D_{i\perp}\nabla n) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Big( \mu_inE_z - D_i\frac{\partial n}{\partial z} \Big) \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Gamma}_e &= \nabla_\perp\cdot(\mu_e n \mathbf{E}_\perp - D_{e\perp}\nabla n) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Big( -\mu_enE_z - D_e\frac{\partial n}{\partial z} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

The equation resulting from setting
\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Gamma}_i = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Gamma}_e\) cannot
easily be separated into one-dimensional equations. Furthermore, the
answer depends sensitively on the boundary conditions at the ends of the
field lines. Unless the plasma is so long that parallel diffusion can be
neglected altogether, there is no simple answer to the problem of
ambipolar diffusion across a magnetic field.

\hypertarget{sec:collision_ionized}{%
\section{Collisions in Fully Ionized
Plasmas}\label{sec:collision_ionized}}

When the plasma is composed of ions and electrons alone, all collisions
are Coulomb collisions between charged particles. However, there is a
distinct difference between

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  collisions between like particles (ion--ion or electron--electron
  collisions) and
\item
  collisions between unlike particles (ion--electron or electron--ion
  collisions).
\end{itemize}

Consider two identical particles colliding (Fig. 5.16 ADD IT!). If it is
a head-on collision, the particles emerge with their velocities
reversed; they simply interchange their orbits, and the two guiding
centers remain in the same places. The result is the same as in a
glancing collision, in which the trajectories are hardly disturbed. The
worst that can happen is a \(90^o\) collision, in which the velocities
are changed \(90^o\) in direction. The orbits after collision will then
be the dashed circles, and the guiding centers will have shifted.
However, it is clear that the ``center of mass'' of the two guiding
centers remains stationary. For this reason, collisions between like
particles give rise to very little diffusion. This situation is to be
contrasted with the case of ions colliding with neutral atoms. In that
case, the final velocity of the neutral is of no concern, and the ion
random-walks away from its initial position. In the case of ion--ion
collisions, however, there is a detailed balance in each collision; for
each ion that moves outward, there is another that moves inward as a
result of the collision.

When two particles of opposite charge collide, however, the situation is
entirely different (Fig. 5.17 ADD IT!). The worst case is now the
\(180^o\) collision, in which the particles emerge with their velocities
reversed. Since they must continue to gyrate about the magnetic field
lines in the proper sense, both guiding centers will move in the same
direction. \emph{Unlike-particle collisions give rise to diffusion}. The
physical picture is somewhat different for ions and electrons because of
the disparity in mass. The electrons bounce off the nearly stationary
ions and random-walk in the usual fashion. The ions are slightly jostled
in each collision and move about as a result of frequent bombardment by
electrons. Nonetheless, because of the conservation of momentum in each
collision, the rates of diffusion are the same for ions and electrons,
as we shall show.

\hypertarget{plasma-resistivity}{%
\subsection{Plasma Resistivity}\label{plasma-resistivity}}

The fluid equations of motion including the effects of charged-particle
collisions may be written as follows

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:resistivity_fluid_momentum}{}{
\begin{aligned}
m_i n\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_i}{\mathrm{d}t} &= en(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}_i\times\mathbf{B}) - \nabla p_i -\nabla\cdot\pmb{\pi}_i + \mathbf{P}_{ie} \\
m_e n\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_e}{\mathrm{d}t} &= -en(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}_e\times\mathbf{B}) - \nabla p_e -\nabla\cdot\pmb{\pi}_e + \mathbf{P}_{ei}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:resistivity_fluid_momentum}\end{equation}

The terms \(\mathbf{P}_{ie}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\) represent,
respectively, the momentum gain of the ion fluid caused by collisions
with electrons, and vice versa. The stress tensor \(\mathbf{P}_j\) has
been split into the isotropic part \(p_j\) and the anisotropic viscosity
tensor \(\pmb{\pi}_j\). Like-particle collisions, which give rise to
stresses within each fluid individually, are contained in
\(\pmb{\pi}_j\). Since these collisions do not give rise to much
diffusion, we shall ignore the terms \(\nabla\cdot\pmb{\pi}_j\). As for
the terms \(\mathbf{P}_{ie}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\), which represent
the friction between the two fluids, the conservation of momentum
requires

\[
\mathbf{P}_{ie} = -\mathbf{P}_{ei}
\]

We can write \(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\) in terms of the collision frequency in
the usual manner:

\[
\mathbf{P}_{ei} = mn(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_e)\nu_{ei}
\]

and similarly for \(\mathbf{P}_{ie}\). Since the collisions are Coulomb
collisions, one would expect \(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\) to be proportional to
the Coulomb force, which is proportional to \(e^2\) (for singly-charged
ions). Furthermore, \(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\) must be proportional to the
density of electrons \(n_e\) and to the density of scattering centers
\(n_i\), which, of course, is equal to \(n_e\). Finally,
\(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\) should be proportional to the relative velocity of
the two fluids. On physical grounds, then, we can write
\(\mathbf{P}_{ei}\) as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:coulomb_collision_momentum}{}{
\mathbf{P}_{ei} = \eta e^2n^2(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_e)
}\label{eq:coulomb_collision_momentum}\end{equation}

where \(\eta\) is a constant of proportionality. Comparing this with the
last equation, we see that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:coulomb_collision_frequency}{}{
\nu_{ei} = \frac{ne^2}{m}\eta
}\label{eq:coulomb_collision_frequency}\end{equation}

The constant \(\eta\) is the \emph{specific resistivity} of the plasma;
that this jibes with the usual meaning of resistivity will become clear
shortly.

\subsection{Mechanics of Coulomb
Collisions}\label{sec:coulomb_collision_mechanics}}

When an electron collides with a neutral atom, no force is felt until
the electron is close to the atom on the scale of atomic dimensions; the
collisions are like billiard-ball collisions. When an electron collides
with an ion, the electron is gradually deflected by the long-range
Coulomb field of the ion. Nonetheless, one can derive an effective cross
section for this kind of collision. It will suffice for our purposes to
give an order-of-magnitude estimate of the cross section. In Fig. 5.18
ADD IT!, an electron of velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) approaches a fixed ion
of charge \(e\). In the absence of Coulomb forces, the electron would
have a distance of closest approach \(r_0\), called the impact
parameter. In the presence of a Coulomb attraction, the electron will be
deflected by an angle \(\chi\), which is related to \(r_0\). The Coulomb
force is

FIGURE:Orbit of an electron making a Coulomb collision with an
ion.\#fig:coulomb\_collision\}

\[
F = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2}
\]

This force is felt during the time the electron is in the vicinity of
the ion; this time is roughly

\[
T \approx r_0 / v
\]

The change in the electron's momentum is therefore approximately

\[
\Delta(mv) = |FT| \approx \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r_0v}
\]

We wish to estimate the cross section for large-angle collisions, in
which \(\chi \ge 90^o\). For a \(90^o\) collision, the change in \(mv\)
is of the order of \(mv\) itself. Thus

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:impact_parameter}{}{
\Delta(mv) \simeq mv \simeq e^2/4\pi\epsilon_0r_0v,\quad r_0 = e^2/4\pi\epsilon_0 mv^2
}\label{eq:impact_parameter}\end{equation}

The cross section is then

\[
\sigma = \pi r_0^2 = e^4 / 16\pi\epsilon_0^2 m^2v^4
\]

The collision frequency is, therefore,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:coulomb_collision_freq}{}{
\nu_{ei} = n\sigma v = ne^4/16\pi\epsilon_0^2 m^2 v^3
}\label{eq:coulomb_collision_freq}\end{equation}

and the resistivity is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:coulomb_resistivity}{}{
\eta = \frac{m}{ne^2}\nu_{ei} = \frac{e^2}{16\pi\epsilon_0^2 mv^3}
}\label{eq:coulomb_resistivity}\end{equation}

For a Maxwellian distribution of electrons, we may replace \(v^2\) by
\(k_B T_e/m\) for our order-of-magnitude estimate:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian}{}{
\eta \approx \frac{\pi e^2m^{1/2}}{(4\pi\epsilon_0)^2 (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}
}\label{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian}\end{equation}

This is the resistivity based on large-angle collisions alone. In
practice, because of the long range of the Coulomb force, small-angle
collisions are much more frequent, and the cumulative effect of many
small-angle deflections turns out to be larger than the effect of
large-angle collisions. It was shown by Spitzer that
Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian} should be multiplied by
a factor \(\ln \Lambda\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian_correction}{}{
\eta\approx\frac{\pi e^2m^{1/2}}{(4\pi\epsilon_0)^2 (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}\ln\Lambda
}\label{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian_correction}\end{equation}

where

\[
\Lambda = \overline{\lambda_D/r_0} = 12\pi n\lambda_D^3
\]

This factor represents the maximum impact parameter, in units of \(r_0\)
as given by Equation~\ref{eq:impact_parameter}, averaged over a
Maxwellian distribution. The maximum impact parameter is taken to be
\(\lambda_D\) because Debye shielding suppresses the Coulomb field at
larger distances. Although \(\Lambda\) depends on \(n\) and \(k_BT_e\),
its logarithm is insensitive to the exact values of the plasma
parameters. Typical values of \(\ln \Lambda\) are given below
(\(\lambda_D\) defined in Section~\ref{sec:debye}).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\(k_B T_e\,[\text{eV}]\) & \(n\,[\text{m}^{-3}]\) & \(\ln\Lambda\) & \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(0.2\) & \(10^{15}\) & 10.7 & (Q-machine) \\
\(2\) & \(10^{17}\) & 11.8 & (lab plasma) \\
\(100\) & \(10^{19}\) & 15.4 & (typical torus) \\
\(10^4\) & \(10^{21}\) & 20.0 & (fusion reactor) \\
\(10^3\) & \(10^{27}\) & 9.6 & (laser plasma) \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

It is evident that \(\ln \Lambda\) varies only a factor of two as the
plasma parameters range over many orders of magnitude. For most
purposes, it will be sufficiently accurate to let \(\ln \Lambda=10\)
regardless of the type of plasma involved.

\hypertarget{physical-meaning-of-ux3b7}{%
\subsection{Physical Meaning of η}\label{physical-meaning-of-ux3b7}}

Let us suppose that an electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) exists in a plasma
and that the current that it drives is all carried by the electrons,
which are much more mobile than the ions. Let \(B=0\) and \(k_BT_e=0\),
so that \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}_e=0\). Then, in steady state, the
electron equation of motion from
Equation~\ref{eq:resistivity_fluid_momentum} reduces to

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:resistivity_momentum_steady}{}{
en\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{P}_{ei}
}\label{eq:resistivity_momentum_steady}\end{equation}

Since \(\mathbf{j}=en(\mathbf{v}_i-\mathbf{v}_e)\),
Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_collision_momentum} can be written

\[
\mathbf{P}_{ei} = \eta en\mathbf{j}
\]

so that Equation~\ref{eq:resistivity_momentum_steady} becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ohm}{}{
\mathbf{E} = \eta\mathbf{j}
}\label{eq:ohm}\end{equation}

This is simply Ohm's law, and the constant \(\eta\) is just the specific
resistivity. The expression for \(\eta\) in a plasma, as given by
Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian} or
Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian_correction}, has several
features which should be pointed out.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian_correction}, we see
  that \(\eta\) is \emph{independent of density} (except for the weak
  dependence in \(\ln\Lambda\)). This is a rather surprising result,
  since it means that if a field \(\mathbf{E}\) is applied to a plasma,
  the current \(\mathbf{j}\), as given by Equation~\ref{eq:ohm}, is
  independent of the number of charge carriers. The reason is that
  although \(j\) increases with \(n_e\), the frictional drag against the
  ions increases with \(n_i\). Since \(n_e=n_i\) these two effects
  cancel. This cancellation can be seen in
  Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_collision_freq} and
  Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity}. The collision frequency
  \(\nu_{ei}\) is indeed proportional to \(n\), but the factor \(n\)
  cancels out in \(\eta\). A fully ionized plasma behaves quite
  differently from a weakly ionized one in this respect. In a weakly
  ionized plasma, we have
  \(\mathbf{j}=-ne\mathbf{v}_e,\mathbf{v}_e=-\mu_e\mathbf{E}\), so that
  \(\mathbf{j}=ne\mu_e\mathbf{E}\). Since the electron mobility
  \(\mu_e\) depends only on the density of \emph{neutrals}, the current
  is proportional to the plasma density \(n\).
\item
  Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian_correction} shows that
  \(\eta\) is proportional to \(T_e^{-3/2}\). As a plasma is heated, the
  Coulomb cross section decreases, and the resistivity drops rather
  rapidly with increasing temperature. Plasmas at thermonuclear
  temperatures (tens of keV) are essentially collisionless; this is the
  reason so much theoretical research is done on collisionless plasmas.
  Of course, there must always be some collisions; otherwise, there
  wouldn't be any fusion reactions either. An easy way to heat a plasma
  is simply to pass a current through it. The \(I^2R\) or \(\eta j^2\)
  losses then turn up as an increase in electron temperature. This is
  called \emph{ohmic heating}. The \((k_BT_e)^{-3/2}\) dependence of
  \(\eta\), however, does not allow this method to be used up to
  thermonuclear temperatures. The plasma becomes such a good conductor
  at temperatures above 1 keV that ohmic heating is a very slow process
  in that range.
\item
  Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_collision_freq} shows that \(\nu_{ei}\)
  varies as \(v^{-3}\). The fast electrons in the tail of the velocity
  distribution make very few collisions. The current is therefore
  carried mainly by these electrons rather than by the bulk of the
  electrons in the main body of the distribution. The strong dependence
  on \(v\) has another interesting consequence. If an electric field is
  suddenly applied to a plasma, a phenomenon known as \emph{electron
  runaway} can occur. A few electrons which happen to be moving fast in
  the direction of \(-\mathbf{E}\) when the field is applied will have
  gained so much energy before encountering an ion that they can make
  only a glancing collision. This allows them to pick up more energy
  from the electric field and decrease their collision cross section
  even further. If E is large enough, the cross section falls so fast
  that these runaway electrons never make a collision. They form an
  accelerated electron beam detached from the main body of the
  distribution.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{numerical-values-of-ux3b7}{%
\subsection{Numerical Values of η}\label{numerical-values-of-ux3b7}}

Exact computations of \(\eta\) which take into account the ion recoil in
each collision and are properly averaged over the electron distribution
were first given by Spitzer. The following result for hydrogen is
sometimes called the Spitzer resistivity:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:spitzer_resistivity}{}{
\eta_\parallel = 5.2\times 10^{-5}\frac{Z\ln\Lambda}{T^{3/2}[\text{eV}]}\, [\text{ohm}\cdot\text{m}]
}\label{eq:spitzer_resistivity}\end{equation}

Here \(Z\) is the ion charge number, which we have taken to be 1
elsewhere. Since the dependence on \(m_i\) is weak, these values can
also be used for other gases. The subscript \(\parallel\) means that
this value of \(\eta\) is to be used for motions parallel to
\(\mathbf{B}\). For motions perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\), one should
use \(\eta_\perp\) given by

\[
\eta_\perp = 2.0 \eta_\parallel
\]

This does not mean that conductivity along \(\mathbf{B}\) is only two
times better than conductivity across \(\mathbf{B}\). A factor like
\(\omega_c^2\tau^2\) still has to be taken into account. The factor 2.0
comes from a difference in weighting of the various velocities in the
electron distribution. In perpendicular motions, the slow electrons,
which have small Larmor radii, contribute more to the resistivity than
in parallel motions.

For \(k_BT_e=100\, \text{eV}\), Equation~\ref{eq:spitzer_resistivity}
yields

\[
\eta = 5\times 10^{-7}\, [\text{ohm}\cdot\text{m}]
\]

This is to be compared with various metallic conductors:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
material & \(\eta\, [\text{ohm}\cdot\text{m}]\) \\
\midrule
\endhead
copper & \(2\times10^{-8}\) \\
stainless steel & \(7\times10^{-7}\) \\
mercury & \(1\times10^{6}\) \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

A 100-eV plasma, therefore, has a conductivity like that of stainless
steel.

\hypertarget{pulsed-currents}{%
\subsection{Pulsed Currents}\label{pulsed-currents}}

When a steady-state current is drawn between two electrodes aligned
along the magnetic field, electrons are the dominant current carrier,
and sheaths are set up at the cathode to limit the current to the set
value. When the current is pulsed, however, it takes time to set up the
current distribution. It was shown by Stenzel and Urrutia that this time
is controlled by whistler waves (R-waves), which must travel the length
of the device to communicate the voltage information.

\hypertarget{collisions-between-species}{%
\subsection{Collisions Between
Species}\label{collisions-between-species}}

Y.Y talked about this during his lecture that the collision rate among
ions or electrons is much larger than the collision rate between ions
and electrons. I need to go back to the notes. See also
\href{https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/143738/why-are-ions-and-electrons-at-different-temperatures-in-a-plasma}{StackExchange
Q\&A}.

\hypertarget{conductivity-tensor}{%
\subsection{Conductivity Tensor}\label{conductivity-tensor}}

Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity. Consider the effect of
collisions as friction in the equation of motion:

\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_e}{\mathrm{d}t} = q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}_e\times\mathbf{B}) - m\nu_c(\mathbf{u}_e - \mathbf{u}^\prime)
\]

where \(\mathbf{u}^\prime\) is the velocity of the collision targets.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In unmagnetized plasma, let \(\mathbf{B}=0\).
\end{itemize}

Assume a steady state with cold electrons
(\(\mathbf{u}_e = \mathbf{v}_e\)) and non-moving targets
\(\mathbf{u}^\prime = 0\), we can easily have

\[
\mathbf{E} = -\frac{m_e\nu_c}{e}\mathbf{u}_e
\]

Since the electron current is defined as

\[
\mathbf{j} = -en_e\mathbf{u}_e
\]

we have from the last two equations

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:classical_conductivity}{}{
\mathbf{j} = \frac{n_e e^2}{m_e\nu_c}\mathbf{E} \equiv \sigma\mathbf{E}
}\label{eq:classical_conductivity}\end{equation}

where \(\sigma\) is the classical conductivity.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In magnetized plasma, let \(\mathbf{B}=b\hat{z}\).
\end{itemize}

Similarly to the unmagnetized case,

\[
0 = -e(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u}_e\times\mathbf{B}) - \nu_c m_e\mathbf{u}_e
\]

In order to avoid confusion, let \(\sigma_0\) denote the classical
conductivity from Equation~\ref{eq:classical_conductivity}. Using the
definition of current density and writing in scalar forms, we now have

\[
\begin{aligned}
j_x &= \sigma_0 E_x - \frac{\Omega_e}{\nu_c}j_y \\
j_y &= \sigma_0 E_y - \frac{\Omega_e}{\nu_c}j_x \\
j_z &= \sigma_0 E_z
\end{aligned}
\]

the solution of which gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
j_x &= \frac{\nu_c^2}{\nu_c^2 + \Omega_e^2}\sigma_0 E_x - \frac{\Omega_e \nu_c}{\nu_c^2 + \Omega_e^2}E_y \\
j_y &= \frac{\nu_c^2}{\nu_c^2 + \Omega_e^2}\sigma_0 E_y - \frac{\Omega_e \nu_c}{\nu_c^2 + \Omega_e^2}E_x \\
j_z &= \sigma_0 E_z
\end{aligned}
\]

or in matrix form,

\[
\begin{pmatrix} j_x \\ j_y \\ j_z \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} \sigma_P & -\sigma_H & 0 \\ \sigma_H & \sigma_P & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \sigma_\parallel \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ E_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

where

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_P &= \frac{\nu_c^2}{\nu_c^2 + \Omega_e^2}\sigma_0\quad\text{Pedersen conductivity}&(\perp\mathbf{B}\&\parallel\mathbf{E}) \\
\sigma_H &= \frac{\Omega_e \nu_c}{\nu_c^2 + \Omega_e^2}\sigma_0\quad\text{Hall conductivity}&(\perp\mathbf{B}\&\perp\mathbf{E}) \\
\sigma_\parallel &= \sigma_0 = \frac{n_e e^2}{m_e\nu_c}\quad\text{parallel conductivity}&(\parallel\mathbf{B})
\end{aligned}
\]

Magnetic field-aligned currents (FACs) are very important in plasma
physics. From Figure~\ref{fig:conductivity}, we see that
\(\Omega_e \simeq \nu_c\) is the most complicated regime where the three
conductivities are comparable, and \(\Omega_e \gg \nu_c\) is the most
anisotropic regime as particles are tightly bound in the perpendicular
direction but free to move along \(\mathbf{B}\).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:conductivity}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{_build/im/KeyNotes_plot_conductivity_.png}
\caption{Pedersen, Hall and parallel
conductivity.}\label{fig:conductivity}
}
\end{figure}

The study of conductivity is most relevant in the Earth's ionosphere,
where \(\Omega_e \simeq \nu_c\) happens at about 100 km above from the
ground, and \(\sigma_0\) is on the order of 100 S/m. Ionosphere forms
within the atmosphere through the mechanisms of electron impact
ionization and photoionization and in turn contribute in a crucial way
to the plasma interactions. The ionosphere is electrically conductive
and thus carry part of a current system that is continued outside the
ionosphere by plasma currents. The properties of the ionospheric
currents are usually described in terms of the \emph{electrical
conductivity} of the ionosphere. Because a strong background magnetic
field threads the ionosphere, the conductivities are strongly
anisotropic. In the direction of the magnetic field, the conductivity is
referred to as the \emph{parallel} or \emph{Birkeland} conductivity. The
Birkeland conductivity \(\sigma_\parallel\) is so high that it
short-circuits the field-aligned component of the ionospheric electric
field, and normally electrical equipotentials align with the ionospheric
magnetic field lines for quasi-static (\(>1\,\text{min}\)) large-scale
electrodynamic conditions. Perpendicular to the magnetic field
direction, the conductivity has components parallel to the electric
field \(\sigma_P\) and perpendicular to the electric field \(\sigma_H\).

Because the electric field vanishes in the field-aligned direction
through the ionosphere (\(\mathbf{E}_\parallel = 0\)), it is meaningful
to integrate the transverse \(\sigma_P\) and \(\sigma_H\) along the
magnetic field direction to evaluate the Pedersen and Hall conductances
\(\Sigma_P\) and \(\Sigma_H\), respectively. For any \(\mathbf{E}\),

\[
\pmb{\Sigma}\cdot\mathbf{E} = \Sigma_P\mathbf{E} + \Sigma_H\hat{b}\times\mathbf{E}
\]

The continuity of currents gives

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ionosphere_potential_derivation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial \rho^\ast}{\partial t} = 0 \\
\nabla\cdot(\pmb{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{E}) = -\frac{\partial \rho^\ast}{\partial t} \\
\int \nabla\cdot(\pmb{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{E}) dz = -\int \frac{\partial \rho^\ast}{\partial t} dz \\
\nabla\cdot(\int\pmb{\sigma}dz\cdot\mathbf{E}) = -\rho^\ast v_\parallel \\
\nabla\cdot(\pmb{\Sigma}\cdot\mathbf{E}) = - j_\parallel \\
\nabla\cdot(\pmb{\Sigma}\cdot\nabla\Phi) = j_\parallel
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:ionosphere_potential_derivation}\end{equation}

\(\mathbf{E}=-\nabla\Phi\), and \(j_\parallel\) is defined such that
upward (\(+z\)) is considered positive. Here we assume that
\(\mathbf{B}\) is aligned with \(\hat{z}\); a more realistic geometry
requires the consideration of inclination angle. See
Equation~\ref{eq:ionosphere_potential} and note the sign difference
between the definitions of \(j_\parallel\).

The forces that act on a flux tube in the ionosphere can be expressed in
terms of these conductances and the force balance expressions can
consequently be used to derive other properties of the ionospheric flow
such as its velocity. (???)

Mass loading contributes to the electrodynamics of the plasma
interaction in ways that are analogous to the contributions of the
ionospheric conductivities. Pickup ionization conserves momentum. An
increase of the ion density results in a reduction of the flow velocity
and its associated electric field. Thus in developing the theory of the
interaction, pickup effects can be directly incorporated into the above
conductances and the interaction region extends well above the
atmospheric exobase.

The Pedersen current (aligned with the electric field) exerts forces
that slow the flow in the ionosphere. The Hall current flows
perpendicular to the electric and magnetic field, thereby breaking the
symmetry of the interaction. The Hall current results in a rotation of
the flow away from the corotation direction and produces ionospheric
asymmetries.

\hypertarget{diffusion-of-fully-ionized-plasmas}{%
\section{Diffusion of Fully Ionized
Plasmas}\label{diffusion-of-fully-ionized-plasmas}}

The magnetic induction equation can be derived from Faraday's law and
Ohm's law. If magnetic diffusivity \(\eta\) is constant, we can write it
in the form

\[
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=\nabla\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B})+\eta\nabla^2\mathbf{B}
\]

We define \emph{magnetic Reynold number} \(R_m\) as the ratio of the
convection term and the diffusion term:

\[
R_m\equiv \frac{\nabla\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B})}{\eta\nabla^2\mathbf{B}}\sim \frac{uBL_0^2}{\eta L_0 B}=\frac{u L_0}{\eta}
\]

There are two extreme cases of \(R_m\). One thing that you should keep
in mind is that this is no longer ideal MHD because
\(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}\neq0\).

\hypertarget{small-r_m-condition}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Small \(R_m\)
condition}{Small R\_m condition}}\label{small-r_m-condition}}

If \(R_m\ll1\), the convection part can be ignored,
(e.g.~\(\mathbf{u}\approx 0\))

\[
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=\eta\nabla^2\mathbf{B}
\]

This is a diffusion equation, meaning that unlike in ideal MHD, plasma
no longer ties to the magnetic field. The diffusion time scale
\(\tau_0\) can be derived as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{B}{\tau_0}=\eta\frac{B}{{L_0}^2}\Rightarrow \tau_0=\frac{{L_0}^2}{\eta}=\mu\sigma {L_0}^2
\end{aligned}
\]

\(\sigma\) is the electrical conductivity, which is a derived parameter
from Ohm's law. For fully ionized plasma,
\(\sigma=\frac{n_i e^2 \tau_{ei}}{m_e}\).

The magnetic diffusivity can be written as

\[
\eta=\frac{1}{\mu\sigma}=\frac{m_e}{\mu n_i e^2\tau_{ei}}=\frac{m_e n_e \ln\Lambda}{\mu n_i e^2 \cdot 5.45\times10^{5}T^{3/2}} =5.2\times10^7 \frac{\ln\Lambda}{T^{3/2}}
\]

where \(\ln\Lambda\) is the Coulomb logarithm (generally \(10\sim20\)
which is insensitive to \(n\) and \(T\),
Section~\ref{sec:coulomb_collision_mechanics}).

corresponds to \(700\text{km}\) on the sun. Right now the best
resolution we have is about \(0.2\sim0.5\ \text{arcsecond}\), which is
about \(100\text{km}\). This means that we are three orders of magnitude

\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}=\eta \frac{\partial^2 B}{\partial x^2}
\]

There is an analytic solution

\[
B(x,t)=B_0\ \text{erf}(\xi)
\]

where

\[
\xi=\frac{x}{\sqrt{4\eta t}}
\]

and

\[
\text{erf}(\xi)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^\xi e^{-z^2}dz
\]

is the \emph{error function}. It has some basic properties as follows:

\[
\text{erf}(\xi)\Rightarrow\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
1 & ,\xi\rightarrow +\infty \\ -1 & ,\xi\rightarrow -\infty
\end{array}
\right.
\]

\[
\text{erf}(\xi)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\Big( \xi-\frac{\xi^3}{3}+\frac{\xi^5}{10}-\frac{\xi^7}{42}+... \Big)\approx \frac{2\xi}{\sqrt{\pi}},\ |\xi|\ll 1
\]

The shape is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:erf}.

If you want to draw this time-variant magnetic field at two different
times \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) (\(t_1<t_2\)), you should have less dense

If \(R_m\ll1\), the diffusion part can be ignored,

  Frozen-flux theorem
\end{enumerate}

The magnetic field lines are frozen in the plasma flow. The magnetic
flux through a surface moving with the plasma is conserved, \[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}t}=0,
\] where \[
\Phi=\int\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}.
\]

ADD FIGURES!!!

\emph{Proof}.

Consider a surface \(S\) with boundary \(\Gamma\). the magnetic flux
through \(S\) is

\[
\Phi = \iint_s \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}
\]

Then the time derivative of flux can be written as

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\Phi}&=\iint_s \dot{\mathbf{B}}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} + \iint_s \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\dot{\mathbf{A}} \\
&=\iint_s (-\nabla\times\mathbf{E})\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} + \iint_s \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\dot{\mathbf{A}} \\
&=\iint_s \nabla\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B})\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} + \iint_s \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\dot{\mathbf{A}} \\
&=\oint_\Gamma \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} + \iint_s \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\dot{\mathbf{A}} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

The change of area can be expressed as

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \mathbf{A}&=(\mathbf{u}\Delta t)\times\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}, \\
\mathrm{d}\dot{\mathbf{A}}&=\mathbf{u}\times\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting into the above equation, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\Phi}&=\oint_\Gamma \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} + \oint_\Gamma \mathbf{B}\cdot(\mathbf{u}\times\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l})=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Keep in mind we are still under MHD approximation

\[
\frac{\partial |\mathbf{B}|}{\partial t} \ll \Omega_i |\mathbf{B}|
\]

This looks like the conservation of magnetic moment.

\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}=(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} +\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\rho}\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}-\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\rho^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}=\Big( \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\rho} \cdot\nabla\Big)\mathbf{u}
\end{aligned}
\] □

Compare Equation~\ref{eq:B_Rho_diff} and Equation~\ref{eq:line_diff}, we
have

\[
\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\rho}\propto \mathbf{l}
\]

i.e.~\(\mathbf{B}/\rho\) and \(\mathbf{l}\) has the same form of
variation. If density does not change much, the magnetic field strength
will be proportional to \(l\).

\section{Plasma Oscillations}\label{sec:oscillations}}

If the electrons in a plasma are displaced from a uniform background of
ions, electric fields will be built up in such a direction as to restore
the neutrality of the plasma by pulling the electrons back to their
original positions. Because of their inertia, the electrons will
overshoot and oscillate around their equilibrium positions with a
characteristic frequency known as the \emph{plasma frequency}. This
oscillation is so fast that the massive ions do not have time to respond
to the oscillating field and may be considered as fixed. In Fig. 4.2
(ADD IT!), the open rectangles represent typical elements of the ion
fluid, and the darkened rectangles the alternately displaced elements of
the electron fluid. The resulting charge bunching causes a spatially
periodic \(\mathbf{E}\) field, which tends to restore the electrons to
their neutral positions.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:langmuir_wave}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{https://s8.gifyu.com/images/plasma.gif}
\caption{Plasma oscillation, also known as Langmuir
wave.}\label{fig:langmuir_wave}
}
\end{figure}

We shall derive an expression for the plasma frequency \(\omega_p\) in
the simplest case, making the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There is no magnetic field;
\item
  there are no thermal motions (\(k_B T=0\));
\item
  the ions are fixed in space in a uniform distribution;
\item
  the plasma is infinite in extent; and
\item
  the electron motions occur only in the x direction. As a consequence
  of the last assumption, we have
\end{enumerate}

\[
\nabla = \hat{x}\partial/\partial,\, \mathbf{E} = E\hat{x},\, \nabla\times\mathbf{E} =0,\, \mathbf{E}=-\nabla\phi
\]

There is, therefore, no fluctuating magnetic field; this is an
electrostatic oscillation.

The electron equations of continuity and motion are

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial n_e}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(n_e\mathbf{u}_e) = 0 \\
mn_e\Big[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}_e}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}_e\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_e \Big] = -en_e\mathbf{E}
\end{aligned}
\]

The only Maxwell equation we shall need is the one that does not involve
\(\mathbf{B}\): Poisson's equation. This case is an exception to the
general rule of Section~\ref{sec:plasma_approximation} that Poisson's
equation cannot be used to find \(\mathbf{E}\). This is a high-frequency
oscillation; electron inertia is important, and the deviation from
neutrality is the main effect in this particular case. Consequently, we
write

\[
\epsilon_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \epsilon_0 \partial \mathbf{E}/\partial x = e(n_i - n_e)
\]

The last three equations together can be easily solved by the procedure
of \emph{linearization}. By this we mean that the amplitude of
oscillation is small, and terms containing higher powers of amplitude
factors can be neglected. We first separate the dependent variables into
two parts: an ``equilibrium'' part indicated by a subscript 0, and a
``perturbation'' part indicated by a subscript 1:

\[
n_e = n_0 + n_1\quad \mathbf{u}_e = \mathbf{u}_0 + \mathbf{u}_1\quad \mathbf{E}_e = \mathbf{E}_0 + \mathbf{E}_1
\]

The equilibrium quantities express the state of the plasma in the
absence of the oscillation. Since we have assumed a uniform neutral
plasma at rest before the electrons are displaced, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla n_0 = \mathbf{u}_0 = \mathbf{E}_0 = 0 \\
\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_0}{\partial t} =  \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}_0}{\partial t} = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

The momentum equation now becomes

\[
m\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}_1}{\partial t} = -e\mathbf{E}
\]

The term \((\mathbf{u}_1\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_1\) is seen to be
quadratic in an amplitude quantity, and we shall linearize by neglecting
it. The \emph{linear theory} is valid as long as \(|u_1|\) is small
enough that such quadratic terms are indeed negligible. Similarly, the
continuity equation becomes

\[
\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial t} + n_0 \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_1 = 0
\]

In Poisson's equation, we note that \(n_{i0}=n_{e0}\) in equilibrium and
that \(n_{i1}=0\) by the assumption of fixed ions, so we have

\[
\epsilon_0 \partial \mathbf{E}/\partial x = -en_1
\]

The oscillating quantities are assumed to behave sinusoidally:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{n}_1 &= n_1 e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \\
\mathbf{u}_1 &= \mathbf{u}_1 e^{i(kx-\omega t)}\hat{x} \\
\mathbf{E}_1 &= \mathbf{E}_1 e^{i(kx-\omega t)}\hat{x}
\end{aligned}
\]

The time derivative \(\partial/\partial t\) can therefore be replaced by
\(-i\omega\), and the gradient \(\nabla\) by \(ik\hat{x}\). Now the
linearized equations become

\[
\begin{aligned}
-im\omega n_1 &= -n_0 ik u_1 \\
-i\omega u_1 &= -eE_1 \\
-ik\epsilon_0 E_1 &= -en_1
\end{aligned}
\]

Eliminating \(n_1\) and \(E_1\), we have

\[
-m\omega u_1 = -i\frac{n_0e^2}{\epsilon_0 \omega}u_1
\]

If \(u_1\) does not vanish, we must have

\[
\omega^2 = \frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 m}
\]

The \emph{plasma frequency} is therefore

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:plasma_frequency}{}{
\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 m}} \quad \text{rad/s}
}\label{eq:plasma_frequency}\end{equation}

Numerically, one can use the approximate formula

\[
\omega_p / 2\pi = f_p \approx 9\sqrt{n}\quad \text{m}^{-3}
\]

This frequency, depending only on the plasma density, is one of the
fundamental parameters of a plasma. Because of the smallness of \(m\),
the plasma frequency is usually very high. For instance, in a plasma of
density \(n=10^{18}\,\text{m}^{-3}\), we have

\[
f_p\approx 9(10^{18})^{1/2} = 9\times 10^9\,\text{s}^{-1} = 9\,\text{GHz}
\]

Radiation at \(f_p\) normally lies in the microwave range. We can
compare this with another electron frequency: \(\omega_c\). A useful
numerical formula is

\[
f_{ce}\simeq 28\,\text{GHz/T}
\]

Thus if \(B=0.32\) T and \(n=10^{18}\,\text{m}^{-3}\), the cyclotron
frequency is approximately equal to the plasma frequency for electrons.

Equation~\ref{eq:plasma_frequency} tells us that if a plasma oscillation
is to occur at all, it must have a frequency depending only on \(n\). In
particular, \(\omega\) does not depend on \(k\), so the group velocity
\(\mathrm{d}\omega/dk\) is zero. The disturbance does not propagate. How
this can happen can be made clear with a mechanical analogy (Fig. 4.3
Figure~\ref{fig:independent_springs}). Imagine a number of heavy balls
suspended by springs equally spaced in a line. If all the springs are
identical, each ball will oscillate vertically with the same frequency.
If the balls are started in the proper phases relative to one another,
they can be made to form a wave propagating in either direction. The
frequency will be fixed by the springs, but the wavelength can be chosen
arbitrarily. The two undisturbed balls at the ends will not be affected,
and the initial disturbance does not propagate. Either traveling waves
or standing waves can be created, as in the case of a stretched rope.
Waves on a rope, however, must propagate because each segment is
connected to neighboring segments.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:independent_springs}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/independent_springs.png}
\caption{Synthesis of a wave from an assembly of independent
oscillators.}\label{fig:independent_springs}
}
\end{figure}

This analogy is not quite accurate, because plasma oscillations have
motions in the direction of \(\mathbf{k}\) rather than transverse to
\(\mathbf{k}\). However, as long as electrons do not collide with ions
or with each other, they can still be pictured as independent
oscillators moving horizontally (in
Figure~\ref{fig:independent_springs}). But what about the electric
field? Won't that extend past the region of initial disturbance and set
neighboring layers of plasma into oscillation? In our simple example, it
will not, because the electric field due to equal numbers of positive
and negative infinite plane charge sheets is zero. In any finite system,
however, plasma oscillations will propagate. In Fig. 4.4 ADD IT!, the
positive and negative (shaded) regions of a plane plasma oscillation are
confined in a cylindrical tube. The fringing electric field causes a
coupling of the disturbance to adjacent layers, and the oscillation does
not stay localized.

\hypertarget{dielectric-function}{%
\section{Dielectric Function}\label{dielectric-function}}

Usually when the permittivity of a material is function of space or
frequency, it is call dielectric function. The dielectric constant
\(\epsilon\) is a quantity which appears in electrostatic when people
describe how a material screens an external time-independent electric
field. When they begin to study how a material screens an external
time-dependent electric field \(\mathbf{E}\propto e^{-i\omega t}\) in
electrodynamic sense they found that the number \(\epsilon\) depends on
frequency, so one gets \(\epsilon(\omega)\). It would be stupid to call
a quantity, which essentially depends on frequency, just ``dielectric
constant'', therefore one calls it ``dielectric function''. Further
studies showed that \(\epsilon\) depends not only on the frequency but
also on the wave-vector of the field,
\(\mathbf{E}\propto e^{-i\omega t +ikx}\), so one gets the dielectric
function \(\epsilon=\epsilon(k,\omega)\).

\hypertarget{es-vs.-em-waves}{%
\section{ES vs.~EM Waves}\label{es-vs.-em-waves}}

A practical way to distinguish ES and EM waves is to check
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}\) and \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}\), where
\(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field of the wave: * If the curvature is
relatively small and the divergence is relatively large, then it is
likely to be ES. * Otherwise it is likely to be EM.

As we will see in Section~\ref{sec:CPDR}, the dielectric function is
defined in Equation~\ref{eq:d_e_relation}. From other perspectives, the
dielectric function shows up in the Ampère's law as well as the
Poisson's equation

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_0\mathbf{j}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}&\equiv\mu_0\pmb{\epsilon}\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E}_1}) + q_j n_j \equiv\nabla\cdot(\pmb{\epsilon}\cdot\mathbf{E}_1) &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Let us consider waves in an \emph{isotropic} plasma. For isotropic
plasmas, the dielectric tensor \(\pmb{\epsilon}\) shrinks to a scalar
\(\epsilon\). For cold plasma (static ion background), the dielectric
function is

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2}
\]

For electrostatic (ES) waves, let \(\epsilon=0\), we have

\[
\omega=\pm\omega_{pe}
\]

For electromagnetic (EM) waves, from Maxwell's equations we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\times\mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}&=\mu_0\mathbf{j}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\equiv\mu_0\epsilon\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
\end{aligned}
\]

With
\(\nabla\rightarrow i\mathbf{k},\ \partial/\partial t\rightarrow -i\omega\),
we can get the dispersion relation

\[
\begin{aligned}
i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E}&=i\omega \mathbf{B} \\
i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}&=-i\mu_0\epsilon\omega\mathbf{E} \\
\Rightarrow k^2\mathbf{E}-\cancel{(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{E})\mathbf{k}}&=\omega^2 \mu_0\epsilon \mathbf{E}.
\end{aligned}
\]

If \(\mathbf{k}\perp\mathbf{E}\), by substituting the dielectric
function inside we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
k^2=\omega^2 \epsilon\mu_0=\omega^2\epsilon_0\mu_0\Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2}\Big] \nonumber \\
\Rightarrow \omega^2=k^2c^2+{\omega_{pe}}^2.
\end{aligned}
\]

For both waves,
\(\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\mathbf{E}_1)=0\Rightarrow i\epsilon(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{E}_1)=0\)
is always valid. However, for electrostatic wave,
\(\mathbf{E}_1=-\nabla\phi_1=-i\mathbf{k}\phi_1\Rightarrow \mathbf{k}\parallel \mathbf{E}_1\Rightarrow \epsilon=0\),
while for EM wave, usually \(\mathbf{k}\perp\mathbf{E}_1\)
(\(\mathbf{k}\perp\mathbf{E}_1 \Rightarrow\) EM wave, but EM waves do
not necessarily need to be transverse. You can always add a component of
\(\mathbf{E}_1\) parallel to \(\mathbf{k}\) without changing
\(\mathbf{B}_1\)), \(\epsilon\) does not need to be zero. Therefore,
\emph{getting the dispersion relation by setting \(\epsilon\) to 0 is
only valid for isotropic ES waves}. For EM waves, there's a systematic
way to get all the dispersion relations starting from dielectric
function, explained in detail in Section~\ref{sec:CPDR}. Here we just
have a simple summary of the steps.

From Maxwell's equation for the perturbed field,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_1 &= -\mu_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{H}_1}{\partial t} \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{H}_1 &= \mathbf{J}_1 +\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}_1}{\partial t}
\end{aligned}
\]

where we have assumed

\[
\begin{Bmatrix}
\mathbf{E}_1(\mathbf{x},t) \\ \mathbf{H}_1(\mathbf{x},t)
\end{Bmatrix}  = \Re
\begin{Bmatrix}
\tilde{\mathbf{E}_1}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega t} \\
\tilde{\mathbf{H}_1}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega t}
\end{Bmatrix}
\]

It quickly follows that

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E}_1 &= \mu_0 \omega \mathbf{H}_1 \\
i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{H}_1 &= i\mathbf{k}\times\Big( \frac{\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E}_1}{\mu_0 \omega}\Big) = \mathbf{J}_1 - \epsilon_0 i\omega\mathbf{E}_1
\end{aligned}
\]

Then there comes the wave equation

\[
\mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E}_1) = \mathbf{k}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{E}_1) - k^2\mathbf{E}_1 =  -i\omega \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_1 -\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}\mathbf{E}_1 \equiv -\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}\mathbf{E}_1
\]

If we can express the total current density as a function of perturbed
electric field, \(\mathbf{J}_1 = \mathbf{J}_1(\mathbf{E}_1)\), from MHD,
2-fluid, or Vlasov model combining with the property of the media, we
can obtain the expression for the dielectric function \(\epsilon\). With
some effort, we get

\[
\mathbf{A}
\begin{pmatrix}
E_{1x} \\ E_{1y} \\ E_{1z}
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

from which the condition for non-trivial solutions leads to

\[
\det{A} = 0 \Rightarrow
\begin{cases}
\text{eigenvalue for } \omega = \omega(\mathbf{k}) \\
\text{eigenvectors} \Rightarrow \text{polarization of E field}
\end{cases}
\]

\hypertarget{sec:CPDR}{%
\section{Cold Uniform Plasma}\label{sec:CPDR}}

As long as \(T_e = T_i = 0\), the linear plasma waves can easily be
generalized to an arbitrary number of charged particle species and an
arbitrary angle of propagation \(\theta\) relative to the magnetic
field. Waves that depend on finite \(T\), such as ion acoustic waves,
are not included in this treatment. The derivations go back to late
1920s when Appleton and Wilhelm Altar first calculated the cold plasma
dispersion relation (CPDR).

First, we define the dielectric tensor of a plasma as follows. The
fourth Maxwell equation is

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0(\mathbf{j} + \epsilon_0\dot{\mathbf{E}})
\]

where \(\mathbf{j}\) is the plasma current due to the motion of the
various charged particle species \(s\), with density \(n_s\), charge
\(q_s\), and velocity \(\mathbf{v}_s\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ampere}{}{
\mathbf{j} = \sum_s n_s q_s\mathbf{v}_s
}\label{eq:ampere}\end{equation}

Considering the plasma to be a dielectric with internal currents
\(\mathbf{j}\), we may write Equation~\ref{eq:ampere} as

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0\dot{\mathbf{D}}
\]

where

induction}. It accounts for the effects of \emph{bound charge within
materials} (i.e.~plasma). Here we have assumed an \(\exp(-i\omega t)\)
dependence for all plasma motions. Let the current \(\mathbf{j}\) be
proportional to \(\mathbf{E}\) but not necessarily in the same direction
(because of the magnetic field \(B_0\hat{\mathbf{z}}\)); we may then
define a conductivity tensor \(\pmb{\sigma}\) by the relation

\[
\mathbf{j} = \pmb{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{E}
\]

Equation~\ref{eq:electric_displacement_field} becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:d_e_relation}{}{
\mathbf{D} = \epsilon\Big( \mathbf{I} + \frac{i}{\epsilon_0\omega}\pmb{\sigma} \Big)\cdot\mathbf{E} = \pmb{\epsilon}\cdot\mathbf{E}
}\label{eq:d_e_relation}\end{equation}

Thus the effective dielectric constant of the plasma is the tensor

\[
\pmb{\epsilon} = \epsilon_0 (\mathbf{I} + i\pmb{\sigma}/\epsilon_0\omega)
\]

where \(\mathbf{I}\) is the unit tensor. In electromagnetism, a
\textbf{dielectric} is an electrical insulator that can be polarised by
an applied electric field. When a dielectric material is placed in an
electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as
they do in an electrical conductor, because they have no loosely bound,
or free, electrons that may drift through the material, but instead they
shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, causing
dielectric polarisation.

To evaluate \(\pmb{\sigma}\), we use the linearized fluid equation of
motion for species \(s\), neglecting the collision and pressure terms:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:motion_linear}{}{
m_s\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_s}{\partial t} = q_s(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}_s\times\mathbf{B}_0)
}\label{eq:motion_linear}\end{equation}

Defining the cyclotron and plasma frequencies for each species as

\[
\omega_{cs}\equiv\bigg\lvert\frac{q_s B_0}{m_s}\bigg\rvert, \quad \omega_{ps}^2\equiv\bigg\lvert\frac{n_0 q_s^2}{\epsilon_0m_s}\bigg\rvert
\]

we can separate Equation~\ref{eq:motion_linear} into x, y, and z
components and solve for \(\mathbf{v}_s\), obtaining

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:v}{}{
\begin{aligned}
v_{xs} &= \frac{iq_s}{m_s\omega} \frac{E_x\pm i(\omega_{cs}/\omega)E_y}{1-(\omega_{cs}/\omega)^2} \\
v_{ys} &= \frac{iq_s}{m_s\omega} \frac{E_y\mp i(\omega_{cs}/\omega)E_x}{1-(\omega_{cs}/\omega)^2} \\
v_{zs} &= \frac{iq_s}{m_s\omega} E_z
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:v}\end{equation}

where \(\pm\) stands for the sign of \(q_s\). The plasma current is

\[
\mathbf{j} = \sum_s n_{0s}q_s\mathbf{v}_s
\]

so that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:current_jx}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{i}{\epsilon_0\omega}j_x &= \sum_s \frac{in_{0s}}{\epsilon_0 \omega}\frac{iq_s^2}{m_s\omega}\frac{E_x\pm i(\omega_{cs}/\omega)E_y}{1-(\omega_{cs}/\omega)} \\
&=\sum_s -\frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}\frac{E_x\pm i(\omega_{cs}/\omega)E_y}{1-(\omega_{cs}/\omega)}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:current_jx}\end{equation}

Using the identities

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{1-(\omega_{cs}/\omega)^2} &= \frac{1}{2}\Big[ \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} \Big] \\
\pm\frac{\omega_{cs}/\omega}{1-(\omega_{cs}/\omega)^2} &= \frac{1}{2}\Big[ \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} - \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} \Big],
\end{aligned}
\]

we can write Equation~\ref{eq:current_jx} as follows:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:jx}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\epsilon_0\omega}j_x &= -\frac{1}{2}\sum_s \frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}\Big[ \Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} \Big)E_x \\
&+ \Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} \Big)iE_y \Big]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:jx}\end{equation}

Similarly, the \(y\) and \(z\) components are

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:jy}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\epsilon_0\omega}j_y &= -\frac{1}{2}\sum_s \frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}\Big[ \Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} \Big)iE_x \\
&+ \Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} \Big)E_y \Big]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:jy}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:jz}{}{
\frac{i}{\epsilon_0\omega}j_z = -\sum_s\frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}E_z
}\label{eq:jz}\end{equation}

Use of Equation~\ref{eq:jx} in
Equation~\ref{eq:electric_displacement_field} gives

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dx}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}D_x &= E_x -\frac{1}{2}\sum_s \frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}\Big[ \Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} )E_x \\
&+ \Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} + \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} )iE_y \Big] \\
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:dx}\end{equation}

We define the convenient abbreviations

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:stix_notation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
R &\equiv 1 - \sum_s\frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}\Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\pm\omega_{cs}} \Big)\\
L &\equiv 1 - \sum_s\frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}\Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega\mp\omega_{cs}} \Big)\\
S &\equiv \frac{1}{2}(R+L)\quad D\equiv \frac{1}{2}(R-L)^\ast \\
P &\equiv 1-\sum_s\frac{\omega_{ps}^2}{\omega^2}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:stix_notation}\end{equation}

where ``R'' stands for right, ``L'' stands for left, ``S'' stands for
sum, ``D'' stands for difference, and ``P'' stands for plasma. Do not
confuse D with the electric displacement field \(\mathbf{D}\). Using
these in Equation~\ref{eq:dx} and proceeding similarly with the \(y\)
and \(z\) components, we obtain

\[
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_0^{-1}D_x &= SE_x -iDE_y \\
\epsilon_0^{-1}D_y &= iDE_x + SE_y \\
\epsilon_0^{-1}D_z &= PE_z
\end{aligned}
\]

Comparing with Equation~\ref{eq:d_e_relation}, we see that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dielectric_matrix}{}{
\pmb{\epsilon} = \epsilon_0\begin{pmatrix}
S & -iD & 0 \\
iD & S & 0 \\
0 & 0 & P
\end{pmatrix} \equiv \epsilon_0\pmb{\epsilon}_R
}\label{eq:dielectric_matrix}\end{equation}

We next derive the wave equation by taking the curl of the equation
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\dot{\mathbf{B}}\) and substituting
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_0\pmb{\epsilon}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{E}}\),
obtaining

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave1}{}{
\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\mu_0\epsilon_0( \pmb{\epsilon}_R \cdot\ddot{\mathbf{E}} ) = -\frac{1}{c^2}\pmb{\epsilon}_R\cdot\ddot{\mathbf{E}}
}\label{eq:wave1}\end{equation}

Assuming an \(\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})\) spatial dependence of
\(\mathbf{E}\) and defining a vector index of refraction

\[
\mathbf{n}=\frac{c}{\omega}\mathbf{k}
\]

we can write Equation~\ref{eq:wave1} as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave2}{}{
\mathbf{n}\times(\mathbf{n}\times\mathbf{E})+\pmb{\epsilon}_R\cdot\mathbf{E} = 0
}\label{eq:wave2}\end{equation}

The uniform plasma is isotropic in the \(x-y\) plane, so we may choose
the \(y\) axis so that \(k_y = 0\), without loss of generality. If
\(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{k}\) and \(\mathbf{B}_0\), we
then have

\[
n_x = n\sin\theta\quad n_z=n\cos\theta\quad n_y = 0
\]

The next step is to separate Equation~\ref{eq:wave2} into components,
using the elements of \(\pmb{\epsilon}_R\) given in
Equation~\ref{eq:dielectric_matrix}. This procedure readily yields

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dielectric}{}{
\mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{E}\equiv\begin{pmatrix}
S - n^2\cos\theta & -iD & n^2\sin\theta\cos\theta \\
iD & S-n^2 & 0 \\
n^2\sin\theta\cos\theta & 0 & P-n^2\sin^2\theta
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
E_x \\ E_y \\ E_z
\end{pmatrix} = 0
}\label{eq:dielectric}\end{equation}

From this it is clear that the \(E_x\), \(E_y\) components are coupled
to \(E_z\) only if one deviates from the principal angles
\(\theta = 0, 90^o\).

Equation~\ref{eq:dielectric} is a set of three simultaneous, homogeneous
equations; the condition for the existence of a solution is that the
determinant of \(\mathbf{R}\) vanish: \(||\mathbf{R}||=0\). We then
obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dispersion_2ndcol}{}{
\begin{aligned}
(iD)^2&(P-n^2\sin^2\theta) + (S - n^2)  \\
&\times [(S-n^2\cos^2\theta)(P-n^2\sin^2\theta)-n^4\sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta] = 0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:dispersion_2ndcol}\end{equation}

By replacing \(\cos^2\theta\) by \(1-\sin^2\theta\), we can solve for
\(\sin^2\theta\), obtaining

\[
\sin^2\theta = \frac{-P(n^4-2Sn^2+RL)}{n^4(S-P)+n^2(PS-RL)}
\]

We have used the identity \(S^2 - D^2 = RL\). Similarly,

\[
\cos^2\theta = \frac{Sn^4 - (PS + RL)n^2 + PRL}{n^4(S-P)+n^2(PS-RL)}
\]

Dividing the last two equations, we obtain

\[
\tan^2\theta = \frac{-P(n^4-2Sn^2+RL)}{Sn^4-(PS+RL)n^2+PRL}
\]

Since \(2S = R + L\), the numerator and denominator can be factored to
give the cold-plasma dispersion relation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cold_plasma_dispersion}{}{
\tan^2\theta = \frac{-P(n^2-R)(n^2-L)}{(Sn^2-RL)(n^2-P)}
}\label{eq:cold_plasma_dispersion}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{wave-modes}{%
\subsection{Wave Modes}\label{wave-modes}}

The principal modes of cold plasma waves can be recovered by setting
\(\theta = 0^0\) and \(90^o\). When \(\theta = 0^o\),

\[
P(n^2-R)(n^2-L) = 0
\]

There are three roots:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P=0\) (Langmuir wave)
\item
  \(n^2=R\) (R wave)
\item
  \(n^2=L\) (L wave)
\end{itemize}

When \(\theta = 90^o\),

\[
(Sn^2-RL)(n^2-P) = 0
\]

There are two roots:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(n^2=RL/S\) (extraordinary wave)
\item
  \(n^2=P\) (ordinary wave)
\end{itemize}

By inserting the definitions of Equation~\ref{eq:stix_notation}, one can
verify that these are identical to the dispersion relations given in
separate derivations, with the addition of corrections due to ion
motions.

\hypertarget{resonances}{%
\subsection{Resonances}\label{resonances}}

The resonances can be found by letting \(n\) go to \(\infty\). We then
have

\[
\tan^2\theta_{res} = -P/S
\]

This shows that the resonance frequencies depend on angle \(\theta\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(\theta=0^o\), the possible solutions are \(P = 0\) and
  \(S = \infty\). The former is the plasma resonance
  \(\omega=\omega_p\), while the latter occurs when either
  \(R = \infty\) (i.e.~\(\omega=\omega_{ce}\), electron cyclotron
  resonance) or \(L =\infty\) (i.e.~\(\omega=\omega_{ci}\), ion
  cyclotron resonance).
\item
  If \(θ = 90^o\), the possible solutions are \(P =\infty\) or
  \(S = 0\). The former cannot occur for finite \(\omega_p\) and
  \(\omega\), and the latter yields the upper and lower hybrid
  frequencies, as well as the two-ion hybrid frequency when there is
  more than one ion species.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{cutoffs}{%
\subsection{Cutoffs}\label{cutoffs}}

The cutoffs can be found by setting \(n = 0\) in
Equation~\ref{eq:cold_plasma_dispersion}. Again using \(S^2-D^2 = RL\),
we find that the condition for cutoff is independent of \(\theta\):

\[
PRL = 0
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The conditions \(R = 0\) and \(L = 0\) yield the \(\omega_R\) and
  \(\omega_L\) cutoff frequencies, with the addition of ion corrections.
\end{itemize}

For R-waves, since
\(\omega_{pi}^2\ll\omega_{pe}^2,\omega_{ci}\ll\omega_{ce}\), the cutoff
frequency can be approximated by

\[
\begin{aligned}
1-\frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega(\omega-\omega_{ce})} - \frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega(\omega+\omega_{ci})} = 0 \\
1 = \frac{\omega_{pe}^2\Big[ \omega\Big(1+\cancel{\frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega_{pe}^2}}\Big)+\omega_{ci}-\cancel{\frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega_{pe}^2}}\omega_{ce}\Big]}{\omega_{ce}\omega(\omega-\omega_{ce})\Big( \frac{\omega}{\omega_{ce}}+\cancel{\frac{\omega_{ci}}{\omega_{ce}}}\Big)} \\
1 = \frac{\omega_{pe}^2(\omega+\omega_{ci})}{\omega^2(\omega-\omega_{ce})} \\
\omega^3 - \omega_{ce}\omega^2 - \omega_{pe}^2\omega - \omega_{pe}^2\omega_{ci} = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Here somehow we can ignore \(\omega_{pe}^2\omega_{ci}\) (I DON'T KNOW
WHY???) and obtain the positive solution

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cutoff_R_freq}{}{
\omega_{R=0} \approx \frac{\omega_{ce}}{2}\Big[ 1 + \sqrt{1+4\omega_{pe}^2/\omega_{ce}^2}\Big]
}\label{eq:cutoff_R_freq}\end{equation}

In the low density limit, \(\omega_p\ll\omega_c\),
\((1+x)^{1/2}\approx 1+x/2\) when \(x\rightarrow 0\),

\[
\omega_{R=0} \approx \omega_{ce}(1+\omega_{pe}^2/\omega_{ce}^2)
\]

In the high density limit, \(\omega_p\gg\omega_c\),

\[
\omega_{R=0} \approx \omega_{pe} + \omega_{ce}/2
\]

Similarly for L-waves, the cutoff frequency can be approximated by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cutoff_L_freq}{}{
\omega_{L=0} \approx \frac{\omega_{ce}}{2}\Big[ -1 + \sqrt{1+4\omega_{pe}^2/\omega_{ce}^2}\Big]
}\label{eq:cutoff_L_freq}\end{equation}

In the low density limit, \(\omega_p\ll\omega_c\),

\[
\omega_{L=0} \approx \omega_{pe}^2/\omega_{ce}
\]

In the high density limit, \(\omega_p\gg\omega_c\),

\[
\omega_{L=0} \approx \omega_{pe} - \omega_{ce}/2
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The condition \(P = 0\) is seen to correspond to cutoff as well as to
  resonance. This degeneracy is due to our neglect of thermal motions.
  Actually, \(P = 0\) (or \(\omega = \omega_p\)) is a resonance for
  longitudinal waves and a cutoff for transverse waves.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{polarizations}{%
\subsection{Polarizations}\label{polarizations}}

The information contained in Equation~\ref{eq:cold_plasma_dispersion} is
summarized in the Clemmow--Mullaly--Allis (CMA) diagram. One further
result, not in the diagram, can be obtained easily from this
formulation. The middle line of Equation~\ref{eq:dielectric} reads

\[
iDE_x + (S-n^2)E_y = 0
\]

Thus the polarization in the plane perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}_0\) is
given by

\[
\frac{iE_x}{E_y} = \frac{n^2 - S}{D}
\]

From this it is easily seen that waves are linearly polarized at
resonance (\(n^2=\infty\)) and circularly polarized at cutoff
(\(n^2 = 0\), \(R = 0\) or \(L = 0\); thus \(S = \pm D\)).

\hypertarget{low-frequency-limit}{%
\subsection{Low Frequency Limit}\label{low-frequency-limit}}

It is very useful to obtain the circularly polarized wave dispersion
relation in the MHD regime.

The R-wave corresponds to electron. When \(\omega\ll\omega_{ce}\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
n^2 = R - 1 - \frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega(\omega+\omega_{ci})} - \frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega(\omega-\omega_{ce})} \\
k^2 c^2 = \omega^2\Big( 1+\frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega\omega_{ce}}-\frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega\omega_{ci}}\frac{\omega_{ci}}{\omega_{ci}+\omega} \Big) = \omega^2 \Big[ 1+\frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega_{ce}(\omega_{ci}+\omega)}\Big] \\
k^2 c^2 = \omega^2\Big( 1+\frac{c^2}{v_A^2}\frac{\omega_{ci}}{\omega_{ci}+\omega}\Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

For \(\omega_{ci}\ll\omega\ll\omega_{ce}\), we can make further
simplification:

\[
k^2c^2 = \omega^2\Big(1+\frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega\omega_{ce}} \Big)
\]

This is the whistler wave, with group velocity
\(v_g=\partial\omega/\partial k\propto\sqrt{\omega}\). It means that
high frequency waves transpose energy faster than low frequency waves.
In other words, one will hear high frequency components earlier than low
frequency components, creating a ``whistler effect''. This was
discovered during the first world war, and the theoretical explanation
came out in the 1950s. Also note that since whistler wave travels along
the field line, in near-Earth space we have signals traveling from the
south hemisphere to the north hemisphere within this frequency regime.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio)}{Here} is an
observation example from Palmer station, Antarctica. For
\(\omega\ll\omega_{ci}\), Alfvén wave is recovered.

See more in Section~\ref{sec:whistler}.

The L-wave corresponds to ion. When \(\omega<\omega_{ci}\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
k^2c^2 &= \omega^2\Big[1+\frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega_{ci}(\omega_{ci}-\omega)} \Big] \\
&= \omega^2\Big( 1+\frac{c^2}{v_A^2}\frac{\omega_{ci}}{\omega_{ci}-\omega} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

For \(\omega\lesssim\omega_{ci}\), we get the ion-cyclotron wave; for
\(\omega\ll\omega_{ci}\), Alfvén wave is recovered.

Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion_parallel} shows the dispersion relations for
L/R waves in a rough scale (ACTUALLY THE SCALES ARE SO BAD\ldots). Above
the cut-off frequencies (\(\omega_{R=0}\) and \(\omega_{L=0}\)) the
solution to the wave dispersion equation is called the \emph{free-space
mode}. Below electron and ion cyclotron frequencies the waves are called
the \emph{cyclotron modes}. At low frequencies (\(\omega\rightarrow 0\))
L- and R-modes merge and the dispersion becomes that of the shear Alfvén
wave \(n^2\rightarrow c^2/v_A^2\).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:dispersion_parallel}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{_build/im/KeyNotes_plot_dispersion_parallel_.png}
\caption{Wave modes propagating parallel to the magnetic field. Some
arbitrary constants are used. Note that log scale is used since we can
easily cross multiple scales so ion scales can be almost invisible if we
include electron scales.}\label{fig:dispersion_parallel}
}
\end{figure}

The dispersion curve for a R-wave propagating parallel to the
equilibrium magnetic field is sketched in
Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion_R_wave}. The continuation of the Alfvén wave
above the ion cyclotron frequency is called the \emph{electron cyclotron
wave}, or sometimes the \emph{whistler wave}. The latter terminology is
prevalent in ionospheric and space plasma physics contexts. The phase
speed is mostly super-Alfvénic except near the electron gyrofrequency.
The wave which propagates above the cutoff frequency, \(\omega_1\), is a
standard right-handed circularly polarized electromagnetic wave,
somewhat modified by the presence of the plasma. Note that the
low-frequency branch of the dispersion curve differs fundamentally from
the high-frequency branch, because the former branch corresponds to a
wave which can only propagate through the plasma in the presence of an
equilibrium magnetic field, whereas the high-frequency branch
corresponds to a wave which can propagate in the absence of an
equilibrium field.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:dispersion_R_wave}{%

\caption{Dispersion relation for a right-handed wave propagating
parallel to the magnetic field in a magnetized
plasma.}\label{fig:dispersion_R_wave}
}
\end{figure}

For a L-wave, similar considerations to the above give a dispersion
curve of the form sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion_L_wave}. In
this case, \(n^2\) goes to infinity at the ion cyclotron frequency,
\(\Omega_i\), corresponding to the so-called \emph{ion cyclotron
resonance} (at \(L\rightarrow\infty\)). At this resonance, the rotating
electric field associated with a left-handed wave resonates with the
gyromotion of the ions, allowing wave energy to be converted into
perpendicular kinetic energy of the ions. There is a band of
frequencies, lying above the ion cyclotron frequency, in which the
left-handed wave does not propagate. At very high frequencies a
propagating mode exists, which is basically a standard left-handed
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, somewhat modified by the
presence of the plasma.

As before, the lower branch in Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion_L_wave}
describes a wave that can only propagate in the presence of an
equilibrium magnetic field, whereas the upper branch describes a wave
that can propagate in the absence an equilibrium field. The continuation
of the Alfvén wave to just below the ion cyclotron frequency is
generally called the \emph{ion cyclotron wave}. Note that the phase
speed is always sub-Alfvénic.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{faraday-rotation}{%
\subsection{Faraday Rotation}\label{faraday-rotation}}

A linearly polarized plane wave can be expressed as a sum of left- and
right-hand circularly polarized waves (R- and L-modes having equal
amplitudes, \(E_0\)). If we assume that at \(z=0\), the wave is linearly
polarized along the \(x\)-axis, and that the wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\)
and the background magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_0\) are along the
\(z\)-axis, we can write

\[
\mathbf{E} = E_0 [(e^{ik_Rz}+e^{ik_Lz})\hat{x} + (e^{ik_Rz}-e^{ik_Lz})\hat{y}] e^{-i\omega t}
\]

The ratio of the \(E_x\) and \(E_y\) components is

\[
\frac{E_x}{E_y} = \cot\Big( \frac{k_L-k_R}{2}z\Big)
\]

Hence, due to different phase speeds of R- and L-modes the linrealy
polarized wave that is travelling along a magnetic field will experience
the rotation of its plane of polarization. This is called \emph{Faraday
rotation}. The magnitude of the rotation depends on the density and
magnetic field of the plasma. Considering frequencies above the plasma
frequency one can show that the rate of change in the rotation angle
\(\phi\) with the distance travelled (assumed here to be in the
\(z\)-direction) is

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}z} = \frac{-e^3}{2m_e^2\epsilon_0 c\omega^2}n_e B_0
\]

and the total rotation from the source to the observer is

\[
\phi=\frac{-e^3}{2m_e^2\epsilon_0 c\omega^2}\int_0^d n_e\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}
\]

where \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}\) is along the wave propagation path. The
total rotation thus depends on both the dnesity and magnetic field of
the medium.

Faraday rotation is an important diagnostic tool both in laboratories
and in astronomy. It can be used to obtain information of the magnetic
field of the cosmic plasma. Note that density has to be known using
other methods. On the other hand, if the magnetic field is known,
Faraday rotation can give information of the density.

\hypertarget{perpendicular-wave-propagation}{%
\subsection{Perpendicular Wave
Propagation}\label{perpendicular-wave-propagation}}

Let us now consider wave propagation, at arbitrary frequencies,
perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field, i.e.~\(\theta=90^o\).

The cutoff frequencies, at which \(n^2\) goes to zero, are the roots of
\(R=0\) and \(L=0\) according to \(n^2=LR/S\). In fact, we have already
solved these equations in the previous sections (recall that cutoff
frequencies do not depend on \(\theta\)). There are two cutoff
frequencies, \(\omega_{R=0}\) and \(\omega_{L=0}\), which are specified
by Equation~\ref{eq:cutoff_R_freq} and Equation~\ref{eq:cutoff_L_freq},
respectively.

Let us, next, search for the resonant frequencies, at which \(n^2\) goes
to infinity. According to the previous discussions, the resonant
frequencies are solutions of

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:resonance_perp_wave}{}{
S = 1 - \frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega^2 - \Omega_e^2} - \frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{\omega^2 - \Omega_i^2} = 0
}\label{eq:resonance_perp_wave}\end{equation}

The roots of this equation can be obtained as follows. First, we note
that if the first two terms are equated to zero, we obtain
\(\omega=\omega_\mathrm{UH}\), where

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:upper_hybrid_freq}{}{
\omega_\mathrm{UH} \equiv \sqrt{\omega_{pe}^2 + \Omega_e^2}
}\label{eq:upper_hybrid_freq}\end{equation}

If this frequency is substituted into the third term, the result is far
less than unity. We conclude that \(\omega_\mathrm{UH}\) is a good
approximation to one of the roots of
Equation~\ref{eq:resonance_perp_wave}. To obtain the second root, we
make use of the fact that the product of the square of the roots is

\[
\Omega_e^2\,\Omega_i^2 + \omega_{pe}^2\,\Omega_i^2 + \omega_{pi}^2\Omega_e^2 \simeq \Omega_e^2 \Omega_i^2 + \omega_{pi}^2\,\Omega_e^2
\]

We, thus, obtain \(\omega= \omega_\mathrm{LH}\), where

\[
\omega_\mathrm{LH} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_e^2\Omega_i^2 + \omega_{pi}^2\Omega_e^2}{\omega_{pe}^2 + \Omega_e^2}}
\]

The first resonant frequency, \(\omega_\mathrm{UH}\), is greater than
the electron cyclotron or plasma frequencies, and is called the
\emph{upper hybrid frequency}. The second resonant frequency,
\(\omega_\mathrm{LH}\), lies between the electron and ion cyclotron
frequencies, and is called the \emph{lower hybrid frequency}.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2016introduction}{F. F. Chen, 2016}) gave
some nice explanations of the physical origins of these frequencies by
looking at the electrostatic electron/ion waves perpendicular to
\(\mathbf{B}\). At low frequencies, the mode in question reverts to the
compressional-Alfvén wave discussed previously. Note that the
shear-Alfvén wave does not propagate perpendicular to the magnetic
field.

Using the above information, and the easily demonstrated fact that

\[
\omega_\mathrm{LH} < \omega_{L=0} < \omega_\mathrm{UH} < \omega_{R=0}
\]

we can deduce that the dispersion curve for the mode in question takes
the form sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion_perp_wave}. The lowest
frequency branch corresponds to the compressional-Alfvén wave. The other
two branches constitute the \emph{extraordinary}, or \(X\)-, wave. The
upper branch is basically a linearly polarized (in the \(y\)-direction)
electromagnetic wave, somewhat modified by the presence of the plasma.
This branch corresponds to a wave which propagates in the absence of an
equilibrium magnetic field. The lowest branch corresponds to a wave
which does not propagate in the absence of an equilibrium field.
Finally, the middle branch corresponds to a wave which converts into an
electrostatic plasma wave in the absence of an equilibrium magnetic
field.

Wave propagation at oblique angles is generally more complicated than
propagation parallel or perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field,
but does not involve any new physical effects.

\section{MHD Waves}\label{mhd-waves}}

\hypertarget{cold-mhd}{%
\subsection{Cold MHD}\label{cold-mhd}}

By ignoring pressure, gravity, viscosity and rotation, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_cold}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} = \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}_0 \\
\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}_0 \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}_1}{\partial t} \\
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_1 = 0 \\
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1 = \mu_0\mathbf{j}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_cold}\end{equation}

As usual in wave analysis, \(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{E}\) are
treated as perturbations. The MHD wave equation for the electric field
can then be obtained,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathbf{E}} &= -\dot{\mathbf{u}}\times\mathbf{B}_0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B}_0 = -\frac{1}{\mu_0\rho}[(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)\times\mathbf{B}_0]\times\mathbf{B}_0 \\
\ddot{\mathbf{E}} &= [(\nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}))\times\mathbf{V}_A]\times\mathbf{V}_A
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\mathbf{V}_A = \mathbf{B}_0 /\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho}\) is the Alfvén
velocity, or if we mutate the triad cross terms,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_cold_e_wave}{}{
\ddot{\mathbf{E}} = \mathbf{V}_A \times [\mathbf{V}_A\times\nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{E})]
}\label{eq:mhd_cold_e_wave}\end{equation}

Alternatively, we can also get the MHD wave equation for the magnetic
field:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left\{ \begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathbf{B}_1} = \nabla\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}_0) \\
(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)\times\mathbf{B}_0 = \mu_0\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}_0 = \mu_0\rho\dot{\mathbf{u}}
\end{aligned} \right. \\
\Rightarrow \ddot{\mathbf{B}_1} = \nabla\times \Big[ \big( \frac{1}{\mu_0\rho}(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)\times\mathbf{B}_0 \big)\times\mathbf{B}_0 \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

or

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_cold_b_wave}{}{
\ddot{\mathbf{B}_1} = \nabla\times \Big[ \big( (\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)\times\mathbf{V}_A \big)\times\mathbf{V}_A \Big]
}\label{eq:mhd_cold_b_wave}\end{equation}

We will see soon that in cold MHD the slow mode ceases to exist, and the
fast mode moves at Alfvén speed, such that along the magnetic field
line, we only have a single wave mode.

\hypertarget{hot-mhd}{%
\subsection{Hot MHD}\label{hot-mhd}}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})=0 \\
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\nabla p+\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B} \\
\mathbf{j}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla\times\mathbf{B} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( p\rho^{-\gamma} \Big)=0 \\
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=-\nabla\times\mathbf{E} \\
\mathbf{E}=-\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}
\end{aligned}
\]

\(\dot{\mathbf{E}}\) is ignored because we only consider low frequency
waves. We assume no background flow, \(\mathbf{u}_0=0\), so the current
is purely caused by perturbed velocity \(\mathbf{u}_1\). Performing
linearization and plane wave decomposition:

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega\rho_1+i\rho_0\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}=0 \\
-i\omega\rho_0\mathbf{v}=-i\mathbf{k}p_1+\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}_0 \\
\mathbf{j}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}_1 \\
p_1/p_0 -\gamma\rho_1/\rho_0 = 0 \\
-i\omega\mathbf{B}_1=i\mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\hat{z}\). The linearized equations can be
further simplified:

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega\rho_0\mathbf{v}=-i\mathbf{k}\big( \gamma p_0\frac{\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\omega} \big) +\Big[ \frac{1}{\mu_0}i\mathbf{k}\times\big( -\frac{\mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)}{\omega} \big) \Big]\times\mathbf{B}_0 \\
\omega^2 \mathbf{v}-{V_s}^2 \mathbf{k}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v})-{V_A}^2\big[ \mathbf{k}\times\big( \mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\hat{z})\big) \big]\times\hat{z}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(V_s=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma p_0}{\rho_0}}\) is the sound speed, and
\(V_A=\sqrt{\frac{{B_0}^2}{\mu_0\rho_0}}\) is the Alfvén speed. If we
write \(\mathbf{V}_A = \mathbf{B}_0 / \sqrt{\mu_0 \rho_0}\), this can
also be written as

\[
\omega^2 \mathbf{v} - {V_s}^2 \mathbf{k}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}) - \mathbf{k}\times \mathbf{k}\times (\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{V}_A) \times\mathbf{V}_A = 0
\]

Due to the symmetry in the perpendicular x-y plane, for simplicity, we
assume the wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) lies in the x-z plane with an
angle w.r.t. the \(z\) axis \(\theta\):

\[
\mathbf{k} = k_x\hat{x} + k_z\hat{z} = k_x\hat{x} + k_\parallel\hat{z} = k\sin\theta\hat{x} + k\cos\theta\hat{z}
\]

Now it can be written as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_v_perturbation}{}{
\begin{pmatrix}
-\omega^2/k^2 + v_A^2 + v_s^2\sin^2\theta & 0 & v_s^2\sin\theta\cos\theta \\
0 & -\omega^2/k^2+v_A^2\cos^2\theta & 0 \\
v_s^2\sin\theta\cos\theta & 0 & -\omega^2/k^2+v_s^2\cos^2\theta
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z
\end{pmatrix} = 0
}\label{eq:mhd_v_perturbation}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{alfvuxe9n-wave}{%
\subsection{Alfvén Wave}\label{alfvuxe9n-wave}}

For any nonzero \(v_y\), the \(y\)-component of
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_v_perturbation} gives

\[
\omega^2 = k^2v_A^2\cos^2\theta = k_\parallel^2 v_A^2
\]

which is known as the \emph{Alfvén wave}, in a uniform plasma immersed
in a uniform background magnetic field with phase speed

\[
v_p = v_A\cos\theta
\]

The group velocity and hence energy propagation is always parallel to
\(\mathbf{B}\) regardless of the direction of \(\mathbf{k}\), and for
this reason this mode is also know as the \emph{guided} mode. This
property, of course, has the direct bearing on the feature of Alfvén
wave resonant absorption.

Given the velocity perturbation \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (0, v_y, 0)\),
\(-i\omega\rho_1 + \rho_0 \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v} = 0\),
\(\omega\mathbf{B}_1 + \mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0) = 0\),
the other perturbations are given as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_Alfven_perturbations}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\rho_1 &= 0 \\
p_1 &= 0 \\
\mathbf{E} &= -B_0 v_y\hat{x} \\
\mathbf{B}_1 &= \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega}\times\mathbf{E} = -\frac{k_zB_0v_y}{\omega}\hat{y} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\omega/k_\parallel}B_0 \\
\mathbf{j} &= \frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_Alfven_perturbations}\end{equation}

SAW has a wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) in the XZ-plane. \(\mathbf{E}\)
shall oscillate in the X-direction; \(\mathbf{B}\) shall oscillate in
the Y-direction. The electric current of the wave \(\mathbf{j}\) lies in
the XZ-plane. The timescale of the variations of the wave fields is much
longer than the ion gyroperiod \(\Omega_i^{-1}\). In both the
perpendicular and parallel directions, the spatial scale of the waves
\(1/k\) are much larger than ion motion scale \(r_{iL}\). The wave
carries a Poynting flux \(S = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}_1\) strictly
parallel to \(\mathbf{B}_0\). The ratio of the wave electric field to
the wave magnetic field \(|\mathbf{E}|/|\mathbf{B}_1|\) is exactly one
Alfvén speed \(V_A\).

\(\mathbf{E}\) (or \(\mathbf{B}_1\)) in
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_Alfven_perturbations} shows that the Alfvén wave in
a uniform plasma is a linearly polarized wave if
\(\mathbf{v}_1 = (0, v_y, 0)\). If instead we set \(\mathbf{k}=(0,0,k)\)
(\(\theta=0^o\)) and \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_x, v_y, 0)\), then
\(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}=0\Rightarrow \rho_1=0\) but
\(\mathbf{E}=-\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0 = kv_y\hat{x} - kv_x\hat{y}\)
can be a circularly polarized wave or else. Correlated \(\mathbf{B}\)
and \(\mathbf{v}\) corresponds to waves propagating anti-parallel to the
\(\mathbf{B}_0\), and anti-correlated \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\)
corresponds to waves propagating parallel to the \(\mathbf{B}_0\). The
resultant magnetic field then exhibits shear, thus the Alfvén wave is
called the \emph{shear Alfvén wave} (SAW). An animation of SAW is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:alfven_wave}. It is useful to remember that the
magnetic perturbation is always parallel to the velocity perturbation.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:alfven_wave}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{https://s8.gifyu.com/images/alfven.gif}
\caption{Alfvén wave.}\label{fig:alfven_wave}
}
\end{figure}

In a non-uniform plasma, SAW attains the interesting property of a
continuous spectrum. To illustrate this feature, let us consider the
simplified slab model of a cold plasma with a non-uniform density,
\(\rho=\rho(x)\), and a uniform \(\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\hat{z}\). Assuming
at \(t=0\) a localized initial perturbation
\(\mathbf{B}_{1y}(x,t=0) = \exp(-x^2/\Delta x^2)\),
\(|k_y\Delta_x|\ll1\), and \(\partial\mathbf{B}_{1y}/\partial t=0\), the
perturbation then evolves according to the following wave equation
(Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_b_wave}, \(B_{1z}=0\) so no coupling between
the fast mode and Alfvén mode):

\[
[\partial_t^2 + \omega_A^2(x)]B_{1y}(x,t) = 0
\]

Here \(\omega_A^2(x) = k_z^2v_A^2(x)\) and the solution is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_alfven_slab_by}{}{
B_{1y}(x,t) = \hat{B}_{1y}(x,0)\cos[\omega_A(x)t]
}\label{eq:mhd_alfven_slab_by}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_alfven_slab_by} shows that every point in \(x\)
oscillates at a different frequency, \(\omega_A(x)\). With a
continuously varying \(\omega_A(x)\); the wave frequency, thus,
constitutes a continuous spectrum. While the above result is based on a
model with a 1D non-uniformity in x, this general feature of SAW
continuous spectrum also holds in magnetized plasmas with 2D or 3D
non-uniformities. A good example is geomagnetic pulsations in the
Earth's magnetosphere observed by Engebretson shown in Figure 1 of
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2021physics}{L. Chen et al., 2021}).

Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_alfven_slab_by} also indicates an unique and
important property of SAW continuous spectrum: the spatial structure
evolves with time. Specifically, the wave number in the non-uniformity
direction is, time asymptotically, given by:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_alfven_wavenumber_nonuniform}{}{
|k_x| = \bigg\lvert\frac{\partial \ln B_{1y}}{\partial x}\bigg\rvert \simeq \bigg\lvert\frac{\mathrm{d} \omega_A(x)}{\mathrm{d} x}\bigg\rvert t
}\label{eq:mhd_alfven_wavenumber_nonuniform}\end{equation}

That \(|k_x|\) increases with \(t\) is significant, since it implies
that any initially long-scale perturbations will evolve into short
scales. This point is illustrated in Figure ??? (CAN I PERFORM THE
SIMULATION?); showing the evolution of a smooth \(B_{1y}\) at \(t=0\) to
a spatially fast varying \(B_{1y}\) at a later \(t\).

Another consequence of \(|k_x|\) increasing with \(t\) is the temporal
decay of \(B_{1x}\). From
\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_1 \simeq \nabla_\perp\cdot\mathbf{B}_{1\perp}=0\),
we can readily derive that, for \(|\omega_A^\prime t|\gg |k_y|\):

\[
B_{1x}(x, t)\simeq \frac{k_y}{\omega_A^\prime(x)t}\hat{B}_{1y}(x,0)e^{-i\omega_A(x)t}\Big[ 1+\mathcal{O}\Big( \frac{k_y}{|\omega_A^\prime t|+ ...} \Big) \Big]
\]

That is, \(B_{1x}\) decays temporally due to the phase mixing of
increasingly more rapidly varying neighboring perturbations.

Noting that, as \(t\rightarrow\infty\), \(|k_x|\rightarrow\infty\), it
thus suggests that the perturbation will develop singular structures
toward the steady state. As we will see in the field line resonance
Section~\ref{sec:flr}, the singularity is reached at the Alfvén resonant
point \(x_r\), where \(\omega^2=\omega_A^2(x_r)\) along with a finite
resonant wave-energy absorption rate. Note that at the isolated extrema
of the SAW continuum, \(|\omega_A^\prime|=0\), phase mixing vanishes;
consequently, perturbation remains regular and experiences no damping
via resonant absorption. This feature has important implications to
Alfvén instabilities in laboratory plasmas.

Space plasmas support a variety of waves, but for heating the plasma and
accelerating the electrons and ions, Alfvén waves are a predominant
source. Near the Sun, Alfvén waves are excited and propagate outward.
They exchange their energy with particles to accelerate them in the form
of solar wind and heat the electrons. When perpendicular wavelength of
the wave becomes comparable to the ion gyro-radius
(\(k_\perp r_{Li}\sim 1\)) or inertial length (\(k_\perp d_i \sim 1\))
in the case of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs, Section~\ref{sec:kaw}) or
inertial Alfvén waves (IAWs), respectively, then the wave in both the
limits has a \emph{nonzero parallel electric field} component which is
responsible for the acceleration of the particles via the Landau
mechanism. This is also consistent with the generalized Ohm's law
Equation~\ref{eq:genearlized_ohm_law}: only when we go beyond Hall MHD
can \(\mathbf{E}_\parallel\) be nonzero. (WHAT ABOUT
\(\eta\mathbf{j}\)?) KAW relates to \(\frac{\nabla P_e}{ne}\) term,
while IAW relates to \(\frac{\partial \mathbf{j}}{\partial t}\) term.
The key interest is in \(E_\parallel\). KAWs and IAWs have significance
not only in space plasmas but also in laboratory plasma such as in
fusion reactors.

Alfvén wave has very high saturation level, meaning that it takes a long
time for the wave to reach the nonlinear phase. (???)

\textbf{SAW in a Slab}

We now look deeper into the properties of Alfvén waves in a nonuniform
magnetized plasma slab that carries a current flowing along an
externally imposed magnetic field \(B_{0z}\hat{z}\), where \(B_{0z}\) is
assumed to be a constant. First, we formulate the governing equation for
the slab geometry, under the ideal MHD condition. Then we show that
Alfvén waves are always neutrally stable, with important indication at
the end.

The presence of an equilibrium current density
\(\mathbf{J}_0 = \widehat{z}J_0(x)\) produces a local magnetic field of
the form

\[
\mathbf{B}_0 = \hat{z}B_{0z} + \hat{y}B_{0y}(x)
\]

The Ampère's law gives

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ampere_slab}{}{
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_0 = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_0 \Rightarrow \frac{\partial B_{0y}}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial B_{0x}}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial B_{0y}}{\partial x} = \mu_0 J_0(x)
}\label{eq:ampere_slab}\end{equation}

From the force balance equation,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:force_balance_slab}{}{
\mathbf{J}_0\times\mathbf{B}_0 = \nabla P_0
}\label{eq:force_balance_slab}\end{equation}

Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:ampere_slab} into
Equation~\ref{eq:force_balance_slab}, we get

\[
\frac{{B_{0y}(x)}^2}{2\mu_0} + P_0(x) = \text{const.}
\]

Designate all perturbation quantities with a subscript 1, and assume
\(e^{-i\omega t+ik_y y+ i k_z z}\) dependence for all perturbations
(nonuniform in the \(x\)-direction, thus no sinuisoidal wave
assumption). From linearized Faraday's law and Ohm's law in ideal MHD,

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_1 = \nabla\times(\mathbf{v}_1\times\mathbf{B}_0) = \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}_1}{\partial t} \\
-i\omega\mathbf{B}_1 = \mathbf{v}_1\cancel{(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_0)}-\mathbf{B}_0\cancel{(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}_1)}+(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla)
\mathbf{v}_1 - (\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}_0
\end{aligned}
\]

where we have assumed the plasma is incompressible. Replace \(\nabla\)
with \(i\mathbf{k}\), \(\mathbf{v}_1=i\omega \pmb{\xi}_1\) and take the
\(x\)-component, we get

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_slab_b1x}{}{
B_{1x} = i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0)\xi_{1x}
}\label{eq:mhd_slab_b1x}\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{k}=\hat{y}k_y+\hat{z}k_z\).

The MHD force law can be linearized to

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab}{}{
\rho_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_1}{\partial t} = -\nabla\Big( p_1 + \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}\Big) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}\big[ (\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}_1 + (\mathbf{B}_1\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}_0\big]
}\label{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab}\end{equation}

Since the plasma is incompressible,
\(\nabla\cdot\pmb{v}_1=0,\ \dot{\pmb{\xi}}=\mathbf{v}_1\Rightarrow \nabla\cdot\pmb{\xi}=0\).
In addition, \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_1=0\). We then have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{k}\cdot\pmb{\xi}_{1yz}&=i\frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x} \\
\mathbf{k}\cdot\pmb{B}_{1yz}&=i\frac{\partial B_{1x}}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\pmb{\xi}_{1yz} = (0,\xi_{1y},\xi_{1z})\),
\(\mathbf{B}_{1yz}=(0,B_{1y},B_{1z})\). The \(x\)-component of
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab} gives

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab_x}{}{
-\rho_0\omega^2 \xi_{1x} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big( p_1 + \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}\Big) +\frac{1}{\mu_0} \big[ (\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla)B_{1x} \big]
}\label{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab_x}\end{equation}

The dot product of Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab} with
\(\mathbf{k}\) gives

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab_k}{}{
\begin{aligned}
-\rho_0 \omega^2 \mathbf{k}\cdot\pmb{\xi}_{1yz} &= ik^2 \Big( p_1 + \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}\Big) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}\big[ i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0)(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_{1yz}) + B_{1x}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0)\big]\\
-\rho_0 \omega^2 i\frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x} &= ik^2 \Big( p_1 + \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}\Big) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}\big[ i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0)(i\frac{\partial B_{1x}}{\partial x}) + B_{1x}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0)\big]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab_k}\end{equation}

Finally, canceling \(p_1 + \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}\)
from Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab_x} and
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_momentum_linearized_slab_k} and substituting
\(B_{1x}\) from Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_slab_b1x}, we obtain the governing
equation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_slab_governing}{}{
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big\{ \rho_0 \big[ \omega^2 - (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big]\frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x}\Big\} -k^2\rho_0 \big[ \omega^2 - (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big]\xi_{1x}=0
}\label{eq:mhd_slab_governing}\end{equation}

where \(k^2={k_y}^2+ {k_z}^2\), \(\mathbf{v}_A = v_A \mathbf{B}_0/B_0\),
and \(v_A=B_0/\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho_0}\) is the local Alfvén speed. This is
the governing equation of shear Alfvén waves in a slab geometry derived
by Hasegawa and Liu Chen in the 1970s, which is readily compared with
Eq.(10.33) in (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan,
2008}).

It is easy to show that this governing equation always yields
\emph{neutrally stable} solutions of SAWs,
i.e.~\(\omega_i=\Im(\omega)=0\). Multiply it by \(\xi_{1x}^\ast\), and
integrate the resultant equation to get

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}x \rho_0 \big[ \omega^2-(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big] \Big[ \bigg\lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}\xi_{1x}}{\mathrm{d}x}\bigg\rvert^2 + k^2\lvert\xi_{1x}\rvert^2 \Big] = 0
\]

where we have assumed that \(\xi_{1x}\) vanishes on the boundary. This
gives

\[
\omega^2 = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}x \rho_0 (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\Big[ \bigg\lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}\xi_{1x}}{\mathrm{d}x}\bigg\rvert^2 + k^2\lvert \xi_{1x}\rvert^2 \Big]}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\rho_0[ \lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}\xi_{1x}}{\mathrm{d}x}\rvert^2 + k^2\lvert \xi_{1x}\rvert^2]\mathrm{d}x} \ge 0
\]

SAWs are the dominant low frequency waves in a current carrying plasma.
The neutrally stable modes studies above can be destabilized by
unfavorable curvature, and such modes are called \emph{ballooning modes}
(Section~\ref{sec:ballooning}). They may also be destabilized by a
finite electrical resistivity, and these are \emph{tearing modes}
(Section~\ref{sec:tearing}). Their interaction with fusion-generated
alpha particles are a major issue in all magnetic fusion schemes.
Finally, since the governing equation exhibits a singularity when
\(\omega=\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A\), this singularity represents
resonance absorption, which forms the basis of \emph{Alfvén wave
heating} (i.e.~field line resonance, Section~\ref{sec:flr}). This
singularity also give rise to the so called ``Alfvén continuum
spectrum'' mentioned above.

Note that the governing equation is valid even if \(B_{0z}\) is an
arbitrary function of \(x\). If in addition, an external gravity
\(\mathbf{g}=\hat{x}g\) in the x-direction is present, the governing
equation is modified simply by inserting the term
\(-(g/\rho_0)\mathrm{d}\rho_0/\mathrm{d}x\) in the second square
bracket, and the equation is identical to Eq.(10.33) of Bellan. This is
the most general equation which describes the
\emph{magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability} (MRT) in Cartesian geometry
using the incompressible, ideal MHD model.

\subsection{Fast and Slow Wave}\label{sec:fast_slow}}

The \(x\)-\(z\) components of Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_v_perturbation} give

\[
\begin{aligned}
(\omega^2-k^2{v_A}^2-{k_x}^2{v_s}^2)v_x -k_x k_z{v_x}^2v_z = 0 \\
(\omega^2-{k_z}^2{v_s}^2)v_z -k_x k_z{v_s}^2v_x=0
\end{aligned}
\]

The dispersion relation is given by the determinant being 0,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_fast_slow}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\omega^4-k^2({v_A}^2+{v_s}^2)\omega^2+{k_z}^2{v_s}^2k^2{v_A}^2=0 \\
\frac{\omega^2}{k^2}=\frac{1}{2}({v_A}^2+{v_s}^2)\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{({v_A}^2+{v_s}^2)^2-4{v_s}^2{v_A}^2\cos^2\theta}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_fast_slow}\end{equation}

``+'' corresponds to the fast mode, or magnetosonic mode, and ``-''
corresponds to the slow mode. The Friedrich graph is very useful in
interpreting Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_fast_slow}.

Given the velocity perturbation \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_x, 0, v_z)\), the
other perturbations are given as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_fast_perturbations}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\rho_1 &= \frac{\rho_0}{\omega}\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v} \\
p_1 &= \gamma p_0\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} = \frac{\gamma p_0}{\omega}\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{E} &= B_0 v_x\hat{y} \\
\mathbf{B}_1 &= \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega}\times\mathbf{E} = \frac{B_0v_xk_z}{\omega}\hat{x} + \frac{B_0v_xk_x}{\omega}\hat{z} \\
\mathbf{j} &= \frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_fast_perturbations}\end{equation}

\(\mathbf{E}\) shows that the fast/slow modes in a uniform plasma are
also linearly polarized. When we have \(\theta=90^o\)
(Figure~\ref{fig:fast_wave}), the magnetic perturbation can be
simplified to

\[
\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{v}{\omega/k_\perp}\mathbf{B}_0
\]

which means that the perturbed magnetic field is always aligned with the
background magnetic field.

The temperature perturbation, based on the equation of state, can be
derived as follows:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_fast_wave_T_perturbation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
T_1 &= T - T_0 = \frac{p_0 + p_1}{(n_0 + n_1)k_B} - \frac{p_0}{n_0 k_B} \\
&= p_0\left( 1+\gamma\frac{n_1}{n_0} \right) \frac{1}{(n_0 + n_1)k_B} - \frac{p_0}{n_0 k_B} \\
&= p_0\frac{1}{k_B}\left[ \left(1+\gamma\frac{n_1}{n_0}\right)\frac{1}{n_0 + n_1} - \frac{1}{n_0} \right] \\
&= p_0\frac{1}{k_B}\left[ \frac{(\gamma-1)n_1}{n_0(n_0+n_1)} \right] \\
&= p_0\frac{\gamma-1}{k_B}\left[ \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0(\rho_0+\rho_1)} \right] \\
&= p_0\frac{\gamma-1}{k_B}\frac{\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\rho_0(\omega + \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v})} \\
&= T_0\frac{\gamma-1}{m}\frac{\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\omega + \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:mhd_fast_wave_T_perturbation}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_fast_wave_T_perturbation} shows that temperature
does not follow the same sinusoidal shape as the perturbed velocity.

In the case \(v_A\gg v_s\) (e.g.~cold, strong B), the phase speed of the
fast mode becomes \(v_p \approx v_A\). This is often called the
\emph{compressional Alfvén wave}. It is also clear that in the cold
plasma limit the slow mode ceases to exit.

\section{Kinetic Alfvén Wave}\label{sec:kaw}}

The solution of Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_alfven_wavenumber_nonuniform}
exhibits singularities as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) naturally suggests that
the microscopic length-scale physics neglected in the ideal MHD fluid
description should be included in the long-time-scale dynamics of SAWs.
For low-frequency SAWs, one can readily recognize the relevant
perpendicular (to \(\mathbf{B}_0\)) microscopic scales are either the
ion Larmor radius, \(r_{iL}=v_{ti}/\omega_{ci}\) with \(v_{ti}\) and
\(\omega_{ci}\) being, respectively, the ion thermal speed and ion
cyclotron frequency, and/or \(r_{eL}=v_{te}/\omega_{ce}\) with
\(v_{te}\) being the electron thermal speed. Including the effects of
finite \(r_{iL}\) and/or \(r_{eL}\) in the SAW dynamics then led to the
discovery of the so-called \emph{kinetic Alfvén wave} (KAW) {[}Hasegawa
and Chen{]}.

In KAWs, parallel electric field \(E_\parallel\) can be developed and
facilitate particle heating, acceleration, and transport. It has been
found in the plasma sheet, at the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL),
and in the inner magnetosphere.

KAW differ from SAW because the short wavelength requires a significant
\(E_\parallel\) to maintain charge neutrality due to ion density
perturbations caused by the ion polarization drift. When \(v_{te}>v_A\),
the parallel electric field counteracts electron pressure that would
push the electrons away from the ion density perturbations. When
\(v_{te}<v_A\), the electric field must overcome the electron inertia
that prevents the electrons from responding rapidly to the ion density
perturbations. \(E_\parallel\) associated with small-scale KAWs may
efficiently accelerate particles on the magnetic field lines. (Chaston+
2009) presented observations in the magnetotail from the Cluster
spacecraft showing that KAWs radiate outward from the X-line with
outward energy fluxes equivalent to that contained in the outstreaming
ions. Wave-particle energy exchange between KAWs and plasmas near the
dayside magnetopause has been confirmed by MMS observations (Gershman+
2017).

We consider a KAW with a wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) in the XZ-plane,
same as in the SAW case. In many aspects, KAW is similar to SAW:
\(\mathbf{E}\) shall oscillate in the X-direction; \(\mathbf{B}\) shall
oscillate in the Y-direction. The electric current of the wave
\(i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}_1/\mu_0\) is still in the XZ-plane. The
timescale of the variations of the wave field of KAW is much longer than
the ion gyroperiod. However, unlike SAW, KAW has

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a perpendicular scale \(k_\perp^{-1}\) that is comparable to the
  particle kinetic scale \(r_{iL}\).
\item
  a very oblique wave vector \(k_\perp \gg k_\parallel\) so that the
  wave is not strongly affected by the Landau damping.
\item
  \(k_\perp^{-1} \ll k_\parallel^{-1}\). The finite-Larmor-radius effect
  starts to become important as the perpendicular wavelength is
  comparable to the ion gyromotion: Ions can not follow the
  \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift in the electric fields of KAW,
  because they encounter significantly different electric field in the
  different phases of the gyromotion. Electrons are still frozen-in in
  the presence of the wave field. The difference in the ion and electron
  motion in the perpendicular direction introduces charge separation and
  coupling to the electrostatic mode. Because the wave electric field
  \(E_x\) is mainly parallel to the \(\mathbf{k}\),
  \(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}=i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E}\) is small and
  \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}=i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{E}\) is relatively
  large for KAW. Accordingly, the perpendicular wave electric field
  \(E_x\) is mostly electrostatic in KAW.
\item
  Because of charge separation in KAW, electrons need to move along the
  magnetic field to preserve the charge neutrality. Associated with the
  parallel motion of electron, a small wave electric field
  \(E_\parallel\) is established, the existence of which is a distinct
  feature of KAW. The parallel motion of electrons creates a
  field-aligned current \(j_\parallel\) of KAW. From Ampère's law
  \(i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}_1=\mu_0 \mathbf{j}\), the field-aligned
  current \(\mathbf{j}_z\) produces a wave magnetic field
  \(\mathbf{B}_{1y}\). As a result, KAW is in fact an EM wave. The ratio
  of the wave electric field to the wave magnetic field is
  \(V_A\sqrt{1+k_x^2 r_{iL}^2}\) (Stasiewicz et~al.~2000). The kinetic
  correction \(k_x^2 r_{iL}^2\) introduces a deviation of the ratio
  \(E_x/B_y\) from one \(V_A\) as in the SAWs.
\end{itemize}

In principle, the KAW eigenmode solution can be obtained from the
linearized two-fluid equations (Dai 2009).

While SAW satisfy \(\omega=k_\parallel v_A\), the dispersion relation of
KAW can be written as (Johnson \& Cheng, 1997)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kaw_dispersion}{}{
\omega^2 = k_\parallel^2 v_A^2 \Big[ \frac{1}{1-I_0(k_\perp^2 r_{iL}^2)e^{-k_\perp^2 r_{iL}^2}} + \frac{T_e}{T_i} \Big]k_\perp^2 r_{iL}^2
}\label{eq:kaw_dispersion}\end{equation}

where \(I_0\) is the modified Bessel function. Using a Padé
approximation \(I_0(x)e^{-x}\approx 1/(1+x)\) when
\(x=k_\perp^2r_{iL}^2\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\), the relation can be
simplified to

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kaw_dispersion_ion_approxi}{}{
\omega^2 = k_\parallel^2 v_A^2\Big[1+\Big(1+\frac{T_e}{T_i}k_\perp^2r_{iL}^2\Big) \Big] =  k_\parallel^2 v_A^2 [1+k_\perp^2(r_{iL}^2+r_{sL}^2)]
}\label{eq:kaw_dispersion_ion_approxi}\end{equation}

where \(r_{sL}=\sqrt{T_e/m_i}/\omega_{ci}\). This term is kind of
strange, because it looks like a Larmor radius for ion with electron
temperature. We can see from
Equation~\ref{eq:kaw_dispersion_ion_approxi} that the phase speed for
KAW is larger than \(v_A\).

While SAWs do not have ion density perturbations, KAWs do (???).

The polarizations of KAW can be expressed as

\[
\bigg\lvert \frac{\delta \mathbf{E}_\perp}{\delta \mathbf{B}_\perp} \bigg\rvert = v_A(1+k_\perp^2r_{iL}^2)[1+k_\perp^2(r_{iL}^2+r_{sL}^2)]^{-1/2}
\]

where \(\delta\mathbf{E}_\perp \perp \delta\mathbf{B}_\perp\). The
parallel electric field is

\[
\bigg\lvert \frac{\delta E_\parallel}{\delta E_\perp} \bigg\rvert = k_\parallel k_\perp\frac{r_{sL}^2}{1+k_\perp^2r_{iL}^2}
\]

It has been shown that KAWs can be generated via magnetic reconnection,
mode conversion, and phase mixing.

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gurram2021shear}{Gurram et al., 2021}) used a 2D
VPIC simulation to show a transition from KAWs to SAWs from the
immediate vicinity of the reconnection region to the exhaust. They
checked two important quantities we have seen above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the transition in wave speeds from super Alfvénic near the X-point to
  order of the Alfvén speed deeper into the exhaust (\(\sim 60 d_i\)
  from the X-point);
\item
  the transition of \(k_\perp d_i\) from larger than unity to smaller
  than unity.
\end{itemize}

It would be very intuitive to compare animations between
\href{https://youtu.be/7RB_kD9aSqo}{MHD Alfvén waves} and
\href{https://youtu.be/aRLXQRvwCas}{kinetic Alfvén waves}. In a typical
MHD Alfvén wave, the particles (yellow) move freely along the magnetic
field lines (blue). In a kinetic Alfvén wave, some particles become
trapped in the weak spots of the wave's magnetic field and ride along
with the wave as it moves through space.

Almost half a century after the discovery of KAW,
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2021physics}{L. Chen et al., 2021})
demonstrated that the proper treatment of this wave requires
gyrokinetics (Section~\ref{sec:gyrokinetics}). However, under some
circumstances (\(\beta\gg 1\)?) the two-fluid theory can recover most if
not all of the KAW physics. I need to go over the derivations!

\hypertarget{particle-motions}{%
\section{Particle Motions}\label{particle-motions}}

In Fourier transform space, integrating the velocity equations to obtain
the coordinates is done by simply dividing by \(-i\omega\). For a simple
case where \(E_y = E_z = 0\) so that E has only an x-component, we find
from Equation~\ref{eq:v}

\[
\begin{aligned}
x_s &= -\frac{q_sE_x}{m_s(\omega^2 - \omega_j^2)} \\
y_s &= \frac{\pm\omega_{cs}}{i\omega}x_s
\end{aligned}
\]

so that in general, the trajectory is elliptical. For
\(\omega\ll \omega_{cs}\), we find \(x_s \ll y_s\), so the motion is
principally across both the \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}_0\)
directions. However, for \(\omega\gg\omega_{cj},x_j\gg y_j\) the motion
is principally parallel to the electric field. In this latter case, we
would call the particles \emph{unmagnetized}, since the magnetic
influence is small. Since it is possible for the wave frequency to be
well above the ion cyclotron frequency at the same time it is well below
the electron cyclotron frequency, it is possible for ions to be
effectively unmagnetized while electrons are magnetized. From the
discussion here, it is also clear that in the MHD low frequency regime
the \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift is important, whereas for high
frequency regimes (i.e.~unmagnetized), the electric field influence is
more important.

When \(\omega\simeq\omega_{cs}\), then the linear solutions exhibit
resonance effects with large amplitudes, and at resonance, the radius
increases uniformly in time and no steady-state solution exists. In this
vicinity, we expect the cold plasma approximation to fail and either
thermal, inhomogeneous, or nonlinear effects to dominate the dynamics.

\hypertarget{cold-nonuniform-plasma}{%
\section{Cold Nonuniform Plasma}\label{cold-nonuniform-plasma}}

Waves and dispersion relations in a uniform plasma is generally nice and
easy. However, more interesting and realistic waves shall be found in
nonuniform plasmas.

\hypertarget{simple-em-wave}{%
\subsection{Simple EM Wave}\label{simple-em-wave}}

Let us start off by examining a very simple case. Consider a plane
electromagnetic wave, of frequency \(\omega\), propagating along the
\(z\)-axis in an unmagnetized plasma whose refractive index, \(n\), is a
function of \(z\). We assume that the wave normal is initially aligned
along the \(z\)-axis, and, furthermore, that the wave starts off
polarized in the \(y\)-direction. It is easily demonstrated that the
wave normal subsequently remains aligned along the \(z\)-axis, and also
that the polarization state of the wave does not change. Thus, the wave
is fully described by

\[
E_y(z,t) \equiv E_y(z)\,\exp(-i\omega t)
\]

and

\[
B_x(z,t) \equiv B_x(z)\,\exp(-i\omega t)
\]

It can easily be shown (???) that \(E_y(z)\) and \(B_x(z)\) satisfy the
differential equations

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_nonuniform_e}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E_y}{\mathrm{d}z^2} + k_0^{~2}\,n^2\,E_y = 0
}\label{eq:wave_nonuniform_e}\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_nonuniform_b}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}\,cB_x}{\mathrm{d}z} = -i\,k_0\,n^2\,E_y
}\label{eq:wave_nonuniform_b}\end{equation}

respectively. Here, \(k_0=\omega/c\) is the wave-number in free space.
Of course, the actual wave-number is \(k=k_0\,n\).

The solution to Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_e} for the case of a
homogeneous plasma, for which \(n\) is constant, is straightforward:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_uniform_sol}{}{
E_y = A\,e^{\,i\,\phi(z)}
}\label{eq:wave_uniform_sol}\end{equation}

where \(A\) is a constant, and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_uniform_phase}{}{
\phi = \pm k_0\,n\,z
}\label{eq:wave_uniform_phase}\end{equation}

The solution Equation~\ref{eq:wave_uniform_sol} represents a wave of
constant amplitude, \(A\), and phase, \(\phi(z)\). According to
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_uniform_phase}, there are, in fact, two
independent waves which can propagate through the plasma. The upper sign
corresponds to a wave which propagates in the \(+z\)-direction, whereas
the lower sign corresponds to a wave which propagates in the
\(-z\)-direction. Both waves propagate with the constant phase velocity
\(c/n\).

In general, if \(n=n(z)\) then the solution of
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_e} does not remotely resemble the
wave-like solution Equation~\ref{eq:wave_uniform_sol}. However, in the
limit in which \(n(z)\) is a ``slowly varying'' function of \(z\)
(exactly how slowly varying is something which will be established later
on), we expect to recover wave-like solutions. Let us suppose that
\(n(z)\) is indeed a ``slowly varying'' function, and let us try
substituting the wave solution Equation~\ref{eq:wave_uniform_sol} into
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_e}. We obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase}{}{
\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}z}\right)^2 = k_0^{~2} n^2 +i\,\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\phi} {\mathrm{d}z^2}
}\label{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase}\end{equation}

This is a non-linear differential equation which, in general, is very
difficult to solve. However, we note that if \(n\) is a constant then
\(\mathrm{d}^2\phi/\mathrm{d}z^2=0\). It is, therefore, reasonable to
suppose that if \(n(z)\) is a ``slowly varying'' function then the last
term on the right-hand side of the above equation can be regarded as
being small. Thus, to a first approximation
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase} yields

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}z} \simeq \pm k_0\,n
\]

and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase_approxi}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \phi}{\mathrm{d}z^2} \simeq \pm k_0\frac{dn}{\mathrm{d}z}
}\label{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase_approxi}\end{equation}

It is clear from a comparison of Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase}
and Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase_approxi} that \(n(z)\) can be
regarded as a ``slowly varying'' function of \(z\) as long as its
variation length-scale is far longer than the wavelength of the wave. In
other words, provided that \((dn/\mathrm{d}z)/(k_0\,n^2)\ll 1\).

The second approximation to the solution is obtained by substituting
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase_approxi} into the right-hand side
of Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_phase}:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}z} \simeq \pm \Big(k_0^{~2} n^2 \pm i\,k_0 \frac{dn}{\mathrm{d}z}\Big)^{1/2}
\]

This gives

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}z} \simeq \pm k_0\,n\Big(1\pm \frac{i}{k_0 n}\Big)^{1/2}\simeq \pm k_0\,n + \frac{i}{2n}\frac{dn}{\mathrm{d}z}
\]

where a binomial expansion has been used. The above expression can be
integrated to give

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_phase_approxi}{}{
\phi \sim \pm k_0\! \int^z \!n\,\mathrm{d}z +i\,\log(n^{1/2})
}\label{eq:wave_phase_approxi}\end{equation}

Substitution of Equation~\ref{eq:wave_phase_approxi} into
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_uniform_sol} yields the final result

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_e}{}{
E_y \simeq A\,n^{-1/2}\,\exp (\pm i\, k_0\! \int^z \!n\,\mathrm{d}z )
}\label{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_e}\end{equation}

It follows from Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_b} that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_b}{}{
cB_x\simeq \mp A\, n^{1/2}\exp\Big(\pm i\,k_0 \int^z n \mathrm{d}z\Big) - \frac{iA}{2k_0 n^{3/2}}\frac{dn}{\mathrm{d}z}\exp\Big(\pm i\,k_0 \int^z n \mathrm{d}z\Big)
}\label{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_b}\end{equation}

Note that the second term is small compared to the first, and can
usually be neglected.

Let us test to what extent Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_e} is a
good solution of Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_e} by substituting
this expression into the left-hand side of the equation. The result is

\[
\frac{A}{n^{1/2}}\Big[ \frac{3}{4}\Big(\frac{1}{n}\frac{dn}{\mathrm{d}z}\Big)^2 - \frac{1}{2n}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2n}{\mathrm{d}z^2} \Big]\exp\Big( \pm i\,k_0\int^z n\,\mathrm{d}z\Big)
\]

This must be small compared with either term on the left-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_e}. Hence, the condition for
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_e} to be a good solution of
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_e} becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:wave_wkb_condition}{}{
\frac{1}{k_0^2}\bigg\lvert \frac{3}{4}\Big(\frac{1}{n^2} \frac{dn}{\mathrm{d}z}\Big)^2 -\frac{1}{2n^3}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 n}{\mathrm{d}z^2}\bigg\rvert \ll 1
}\label{eq:wave_wkb_condition}\end{equation}

The solutions Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_e} and
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_nonuniform_sol_b} (without the second term) are
most commonly referred to as the \emph{WKB} solutions, in honour of G.
Wentzel, H.A. Kramers, and L. Brillouin, who are credited with
independently discovering these solutions (in a quantum mechanical
context) in 1926. Actually, H. Jeffries wrote a paper on the WKB
solutions (in a wave propagation context) in 1923. Hence, some people
call them the WKBJ solutions (or even the JWKB solutions). To be
strictly accurate, the WKB solutions were first discussed by Liouville
and Green in 1837, and again by Rayleigh in 1912. The advance in science
discovery is always a collective achievement.

Recall, that when a propagating wave is normally incident on an
interface, where the refractive index suddenly changes (for instance,
when a light wave propagating through air is normally incident on a
glass slab), there is generally significant reflection of the wave.
However, according to the WKB solutions, when a propagating wave is
normally incident on a medium in which the refractive index changes
slowly along the direction of propagation of the wave then the wave is
not reflected at all. This is true even if the refractive index varies
very substantially along the path of propagation of the wave, as long as
it varies slowly. The WKB solutions imply that as the wave propagates
through the medium its wave-length gradually changes. In fact, the
wave-length at position \(z\) is approximately
\(\lambda(z)= 2\pi/ k_0\,n(z)\). The WKB solutions also imply that the
amplitude of the wave gradually changes as it propagates. The amplitude
of the electric field component is inversely proportional to
\(n^{1/2}\), whereas the amplitude of the magnetic field component is
directly proportional to \(n^{1/2}\). Note, however, that the energy
flux in the \(z\)-direction, given by the the Poynting vector
\(-(E_y B_x^\ast +E_y^\ast B_x)/(4\mu_0)\), remains constant (assuming
that \(n\) is predominately real).

Of course, the WKB solutions are only approximations. In reality, a wave
propagating into a medium in which the refractive index is a slowly
varying function of position is subject to a small amount of reflection.
However, it is easily demonstrated that the ratio of the reflected
amplitude to the incident amplitude is of order
\((dn/\mathrm{d}z)/(k_0\,n^2)\). Thus, as long as the refractive index
varies on a much longer length-scale than the wavelength of the
radiation, the reflected wave is negligibly small. This conclusion
remains valid as long as the inequality
Equation~\ref{eq:wave_wkb_condition} is satisfied. This inequality
obviously breaks down in the vicinity of a point where \(n^2=0\). We
would, therefore, expect strong reflection of the incident wave from
such a point. Furthermore, the WKB solutions also break down at a point
where \(n^2\rightarrow\infty\), since the amplitude of \(B_x\) becomes
infinite.

\hypertarget{electron-cyclotron-resonance-heating}{%
\subsection{Electron Cyclotron Resonance
Heating}\label{electron-cyclotron-resonance-heating}}

Let us look at the problem of electron cyclotron resonance heating. The
resonance condition is \(R=\infty\); the governing equation has the form

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}z^2} + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} \Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}(z)}^2}{\omega(\omega-\omega_{ce}(z))} \Big]E = 0
\]

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:ECRH}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ECRH.png}
\caption{Plasma frequency and wave number as functions of \(z\) in a
non-uniform plasma for the electron cyclotron resonance
mode.}\label{fig:ECRH}
}
\end{figure}

We use \(z\) here to remind ourselves of the fact that the wave property
changes along the field line. Imagine a wave
\(\sim e^{i(kz -\omega t)}\) incident into a plasma with fixed density
\(n_0\) and varying magnetic field \(B_0(z)\) as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ECRH}(a). At \(z=z_R\),
\(\omega_{ce}(z) = \omega_{ce}(z_R) = \omega\). Then we can draw
\(k^2(z)\) as a function of \(z\) as in Figure~\ref{fig:ECRH}(b). There
is a pole at \(z=z_R\), which indicates resonance since
\(k^2\rightarrow\infty\). There is also a zero on the right of \(z_R\).

Close to \(z=z_R\), we have \(k^2(z)\sim \frac{\text{const}.}{z-z_R}\).
If we write

\[
\Omega_e(z)=-A^\prime (z-z_R)+\omega,\quad \zeta = z-z_R
\]

then (ignore the constants)

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\mathrm{d}z^2} - \frac{\text{const.}}{z-z_R}E = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 E}{d\zeta^2} - \frac{1}{\zeta}E = 0
\]

Now let's stare at Figure~\ref{fig:ECRH}(b) for a few seconds. If there
is a wave from left to right, there will be a resonance at \(z=z_R\);
but if there is a wave from right to left, then the wave will be
attenuated before it reaches \(z=z_R\) because there is a zero ahead.
This means that waves from different origin will have different
behaviors!

\hypertarget{o-mode}{%
\subsection{O-mode}\label{o-mode}}

Next consider EM waves in non-magnetized plasma of ordinary O-mode:

\[
k^2(x) = \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}n^2 = \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}\Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}(x)}^2}{\omega^2}\Big] \quad \text{if } n \text{ is non-uniform}
\]

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:Omode}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Omode.png}
\caption{Plasma frequency and wave number as functions of \(x\) in a
non-uniform plasma for O mode.}\label{fig:Omode}
}
\end{figure}

Note that there is no energy dissipation, because it is collisionless.
Imagine a wave \(\sim e^{i(kx-\omega t)}\) incident into a plasma with
density \(n_0(x)\) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Omode}. We encounter a
cutoff at \(x=x_t\), \(\omega_{pe}(x_t) = \omega\). Therefore we can
draw \(k^2(x)\) as a function of x as in Figure~\ref{fig:Omode}. Then
the properties of the wave can be categorized into two regimes:

\[
\begin{aligned}
k^2 < 0 \Rightarrow\ E\sim e^{\pm ikx}\ \text{propagating}\\
k^2 > 0 \Rightarrow\ E\sim e^{\pm|k| x}\ \text{attenuating}
\end{aligned}
\]

A natural question comes up from this picture: \emph{how does the
propagating wave transform into attentuating wave}? Stokes solved this
during his honey moon, which is now known as the Stokes phenomenon
(Section~\ref{sec:stokes_phenomenon}).

\hypertarget{warm-uniform-plasma}{%
\section{Warm Uniform Plasma}\label{warm-uniform-plasma}}

Taking one step forward, we can no longer neglect the kinetic effects,
i.e.~the cold assumption is no longer valid. For the sake of simplicity,
we only consider the 1D case. The approach is very similar to cold
plasma situation, except that we have \emph{pressure} included in the
equation, and we also need to specify the relation of pressure and
temperature through the equation of state.

\textbf{2-fluid approach}

Equilibrium:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&m_i=\infty,\ T_i=0,\ v_{i,0}=0,\ n_{e0}=n_{i0}=n_0,\ E_0=0,\ B_0=0 \\
&P_0=const.,\ v_{e0}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

The equation of motion for electron is

\[
\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}=-\frac{e}{m_e}\mathbf{E}-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}
\]

Assume

\[
\begin{aligned}
&P=P_0 \Big( \frac{n}{n_0}\Big)^\gamma  &\text{adiabatic}\\
&P=nk_B T_e  &\text{isothermal}(\gamma=1)
\end{aligned}
\]

Define
\(P_1=\Big( \partial P/\partial \rho\Big)\rho_1\equiv {v_{th}}^2\rho_1={v_{th}}^2 n_1 m=k_BTn_1\).
Decompose the primitive variables into equilibrium and perturbation
components:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&n= n_0+n_1=n_0+\tilde{n}_1e^{-i\omega t+ikx} \\
&v=\cancel{v_0}+v_1=\tilde{v}_1 e^{-i\omega t+ikx} \\
&P=P_0+P_1=P_0+\tilde{P}_1e^{-i\omega t+ikx}
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting into the equation of motion and keeping only first order
terms, we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial t}&=-\frac{e}{m_e}(E_1)-\frac{\nabla (P_1)}{n_0m_e} \\
-i\omega v_1&=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1-\frac{ik{v_{th}}^2 n_1}{n_0}
\end{aligned}
\]

The continuity equation gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big( nv\Big)=0 \\
\Rightarrow v_1=\frac{\omega n_1}{kn_0}
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting this into the linearized equation of motion, we get

\[
n_1=\frac{kn_0eE_1}{im_e(\omega^2-k^2{v_{th}}^2)}
\]

which is the density perturbation in response to \(E_1\). Following the
same approach as before, we can easily get the dielectric function:

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2-k^2{v_{th}}^2}
\]

Let \(\epsilon=0\), we get the dispersion relation for warm plasma

\[
\omega^2=k^2{v_{th}}^2+{\omega_{pe}}^2
\]

This is called the \emph{Bohm-Gross dispersion relation}.

\textbf{Vlasov approach}

Assume Maxwellian distribution for electrons:

\[
g_e(v)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\frac{1}{v_{th,e}}e^{-v^2/2{v_{th,e}}^2}
\]

Assuming \(\frac{\omega}{k}\gg v_{th,e}\), i.e.~the phase speed is much
larger than the characteristic thermal speed, we can do Taylor series
expansion

\[
\frac{1}{(v-\omega/k)^2}=\frac{1}{(\omega/k)^2}\frac{1}{(1-kv/\omega)^2}\approx \frac{k^2}{\omega^2}\Big[ 1+\frac{2kv}{\omega}+\frac{3k^2v^2}{\omega^2}+...\Big]
\]

Then the dielectric function is

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv g(v)\frac{k^2}{\omega^2}\Big[ 1+\frac{2kv}{\omega}+\frac{3k^2v^2}{\omega^2}+...\Big] \\
&\doteq 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2}\Big[ 1+\frac{3k^2{v_{th}}^2}{\omega^2} \Big] .
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(\epsilon=0\), we can get the dispersion relation for warm plasma,

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{lowest order: } \omega=\pm \omega_{pe} \\
&\text{first order:} 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2}\Big( 1+\frac{3k^2{v_{th}}^2}{{\omega_{pe}}^2}\Big)=0\Rightarrow \omega^2={\omega_{pe}}^2+3k^2{v_{th,e}}^2
\end{aligned}
\]

Note here we insert \(0^{th}\) order solution to \(1^{st}\) order
equation to get the next level approximation. Comparing with the results
from 2-fluid theory, we see that the expression is very similar except a
discrepancy in the coefficient. This is owing to the fact that we do not
specify \(\gamma\) in the equation of state. Actually, there are still
ambiguities and debates about the exact equation of state. I wonder if I
can get the exact coefficient under some assumption.

The opposite limit case: \(\frac{\omega}{k}\ll v_{th}\). From 2-fluid
theory,

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}\approxeq1+\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}
\]

From Vlasov theory,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv\frac{\partial g/\partial v}{v-\omega/k}=
1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{v-\cancel{\omega/k}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\frac{1}{v_{th,e}}\Big(\frac{-v}{{v_{th,e}}^2} \Big) e^{-v^2/2{v_{th,e}}^2}dv  \\
&=1+\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{v_{th,e}^2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-v^2/2{v_{th,e}}^2}dv \\
&=1+\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

So we can see in the two limit cases that they ``almost'' give the same
results!

If we include ion motion in the 2-fluid theory
(\(n_{1i}\neq0, T_i\neq0,m_i\neq\infty\)), applying the linear
superposition property, we have

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=\underbrace{1}_{\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}_1)}-\underbrace{\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2-k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}}_{en_{1e}}-\underbrace{\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2-k^2{v_{th,i}}^2}}_{en_{1i}}
\]

\textbf{Ion-acoustic wave}

Assume \(v_{th,e}\gg \frac{\omega}{k}\gg v_{th,i}\), we have the
simplified dielectric function

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1+\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}
\]

Assume quasi-neutrality condition: \(n_{1e}\approx n_{1i}\), s.t.

\[
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}_1)=e(n_{1e}-n_{1i})\approx 0
\]

so we can ignore the ``1'' in the dielectric function. Let
\(\epsilon=0\), we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2{v_{th,e}}^2}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}=0 \\
\Rightarrow \omega^2=k^2{v_{th,e}}^2\frac{m_e}{m_i},\ \frac{\omega}{k}=\sqrt{\frac{k_BT_e}{m_i}}\equiv c_s
\end{aligned}
\]

Physically, electron sees the electric field created by ions due to ion
plasma oscillation. Since electrons move much faster than ions, this
electric field is nearly electrostatic for electrons. As a result,
electron just follows the ion motion.

There are some other ways to get the ion-acoustic wave. If
\(\omega\ll \omega_{pe}\), we can treat this wave as electrostatic wave
for electron. The distribution for electron number density is

\[
\begin{aligned}
&n_{e}=n_0e^{e\phi/k_B T_e}\approxeq n_{0e}+n_{1e} \approxeq n_0[1+\frac{e\phi}{k_BT_e}+...] \\
\Rightarrow &n_{1e}=n_0\frac{e\phi}{k_BT_e}=\frac{n_0eE_1}{-ikm_e{v_{th,e}}^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that here the tilde signs \(\sim\) of the variables are neglected
for convenience without ambiguity.

Do we need to calculate \(n_{1i}\)??? Yes. MORE to do here!

Also, from the linearized equation of motion for electron,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial v_{e1}}{\partial t}=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1-\frac{\nabla P_1}{n_0m_e} \\
-i\omega v_{e1}=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1-\frac{ik P_1}{n_0m_e}=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1-\frac{ik n_{1e}k_BT_e}{n_0m_e}
\end{aligned}
\]

In the \(\omega\rightarrow 0\) limit, \(LHS\doteq0\), we get

\[
n_{1e}= \frac{n_0eE_1}{-ikm_e{v_{th,e}}^2}
\]

Then again we get the dielectric function through Poisson's equation.

\hypertarget{sec:es_wave_magnetized}{%
\section{Electrostatic Wave in a Magnetized
Plasma}\label{sec:es_wave_magnetized}}

Now we continue to discuss the property of electrostatic waves with
background magnetic field.

First let us introduce a useful result for continuity equation. Assuming
\(n_0=n_0(\mathbf{x}),\ \mathbf{v}_0=\mathbf{v}_0(\mathbf{x})\) in
equilibrium, \(\mathbf{x}_1=\mathbf{x}_1(\mathbf{x},t)\) is the
perturbation in displacement. We can show that the linearized continuity
equation has an equivalent form:

\[
\frac{\partial n_1(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot[ n_0(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{x},t)+n_1(\mathbf{x},t)\mathbf{v}_0(\mathbf{x},t)]=0
\Leftrightarrow n_1(\mathbf{x},t)=-\nabla\cdot[n_0(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{x}_1(\mathbf{x},t)]
\]

The proof is related to mass conservation shown as follows. Intuitively,
you can think of this as the degree of condensation only depends on
displacement, not on how you get there (speed).

In 1D,

\[
\begin{aligned}
n_0=n_0(x_0)=\text{unperturbed density} \\
x= x_0+x_1(x_0,t)=\text{instantanenous position} \\
n(x_0,t)=n_0(x_0)+n_1(x_0,t)=\text{total density}
\end{aligned}
\]

At time \(t\),
\([x_0,x_0+\mathrm{d}x]\rightarrow[x_0+x_1(x_0,t),x_0+\mathrm{d}x+x_1(x_0+\mathrm{d}x,t)]\).
Due to mass conservation, we have (This looks like the derivation of
deformation in fluid dynamics.)

\[
\begin{aligned}
n_0(x_0)\mathrm{d}x&=[n_0(x_0+x_1)+n_1(x_0+x_1,t)]\cdot[x_0+\mathrm{d}x+x_1(x_0+\mathrm{d}x,t)-(x_0+x_1(x_0,t))] \\
&\approx \Big[n_0(x_0)+x_1\frac{\partial n_0(x_0)}{\partial x_0}+n_1(x_0,t)\Big]\mathrm{d}x\Big[1+\frac{\partial x_1(x_0,t)}{\partial x_0}\Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\Rightarrow n_0(x_0)=n_0(x_0)+n_0(x_0)\frac{\partial x_1(x_0,t)}{\partial x_0}+x_1\frac{\partial n_0(x_0)}{\partial x_0}+n_1(x_0,t) \\
&\Rightarrow n_1(x_0,t)=-n_0(x_0)\frac{\partial x_1(x_0,t)}{\partial x_0}-x_1\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x_0}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_0}\big[ n_0(x_0)x_1(x_0,t) \big] \\
&\Rightarrow n_1(x,t)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\big[ n_0(x)x_1(x,t)\big]
\end{aligned}
\]

The simplest equilibrium state in a constant magnetized plasma is

\[
\begin{aligned}
&n_{i0}=n_{e0}=n_0,\ \mathbf{E}_0=0,\ \mathbf{B}_0=B_0\widehat{z} \\
&\mathbf{v}_{e0}=\mathbf{v}_{i0}=0,\ T_e=0,\ T_i=0,\ m_i=\infty
\end{aligned}
\]

Now introduce an electrostatic perturbation
(\(\mathbf{E}_1=-\nabla\phi_1\))

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{E}_1=\tilde{\mathbf{E}_1}e^{-i\omega t+i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}=-i\mathbf{k}\tilde{\phi}_1 e^{-i\omega t+i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}
\end{aligned}
\]

we can confirm that this is indeed an electrostatic perturbation since
\(\mathbf{E}_1\parallel \mathbf{k}\) and \(\mathbf{B}_1=0\).

\emph{Case 1}: \(\mathbf{k}=k_z\widehat{z}\parallel \mathbf{B}_0\),
i.e.~parallel propagation. Then
\(\mathbf{E}_1=\widehat{z}E_{1z}e^{-i\omega t+ik_z z}\). This is the
same as if there is no magnetic field, so the dielectric function is

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2}
\]

\emph{Case 2}: \(\mathbf{k}\perp \mathbf{B}_0\), i.e.~perpendicular
propagation. Without loss of generality, let
\(\mathbf{k}=k_x\widehat{x}\). Then

\[
\mathbf{E}_1=\widehat{x}\tilde{E}_{1x}e^{-i\omega t+ik_x x}
\]

The equations of motion (cold plasma) in the \(x\) and \(y\) direction
are

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{x}_1 &= -\frac{e}{m_e}[E_{1x}+\dot{y}_1B_0] \\
\ddot{y}_1 &= -\frac{e}{m_e}[-\dot{x}_1B_0] \\
\Rightarrow \dot{y}_1&=\frac{eB_0}{m_e}x_1=|\Omega_e| x_1  \\
\ddot{x}_1&=-\frac{e}{m_e}[E_{1x}+|\Omega_e|\cdot{y_1}B_0]=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1x}-{\Omega_e}^2 x_1,  \\
\Rightarrow x_1&=\frac{-\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1x}}{-\omega^2+{\Omega_e}^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then we have the perturbed density in response to the perturbed electric
field \(E_{1x}\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
n_1=-n_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{x}_1=-n_0ik_x x_1=-n_0ik_x\frac{-\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1x}}{-\omega^2+{\Omega_e}^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

From Poisson's equation, we get the dielectric function (the same method
as before):

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2-{\Omega_e}^2}
\]

Let \(\epsilon=0\), we have

\[
\omega=\sqrt{{\omega_{pe}}^2+{\Omega_e}^2}\equiv \omega_{UH}
\]

which is called the \emph{upper hybrid} frequency. This is the highest
characteristic frequency in plasma. This upper hybrid wave is a havoc to
some beam generator devices as it appears near the electron collector.

What if ions are included? Similar to previous derivations and notice
that we are still within the range of linear theory, we have

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2-{\Omega_e}^2}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2-{\Omega_i}^2}
\]

For \(\Omega_i\ll \omega\ll \Omega_e\) with quasi-neutrality condition
\(n_{1e}\approx n_{1i}\), we can have a simplified dispersion relation
by letting \(\epsilon=0\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{{\Omega_{e}}^2}=\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}\\
\Rightarrow& \omega=\sqrt{{\omega_{pi}}^2\frac{{\Omega_e}^2}{{\omega_{pe}}^2}}=\sqrt{|\Omega_e \Omega_i|}\equiv \omega_{LH}
\end{aligned}
\]

which gives us the \emph{low hybrid wave} frequency. It equals to the
geometric mean of the two cyclotron frequencies. Actually, this can be
obtained from pure plasma motion argument. Recall that
\(\Omega_i \ll \omega \ll \Omega_e\) means that for electrons the plasma
seems to be nonmagnetized, so they moves only under the electric field,

\[
v_{1ex}=\frac{-eE_{1x}}{m_e(-i\omega)}
\]

On the other hand, for ions the magnetic field is strong while electric
field still exists, so it experiences polarization drift along the
direction of perturbed electric field,

\[
v_{1ix}=\frac{1}{\Omega_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Big( \frac{E_{1x}}{B_0}\Big)
\]

Under quasi-neutrality condition, \(v_{1ix}=v_{1ex}\), so we have

\[
\frac{-eE_{1x}}{m_e(-i\omega)}=\frac{1}{\Omega_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Big( \frac{E_{1x}}{B_0}\Big) \Rightarrow \omega=\sqrt{|\Omega_e \Omega_i|}
\]

If we consider warm plasma for 1D, there is an additional pressure term
in the momentum equation. The continuity equation together with
Poisson's equation give the relation of perturbed displacement and
electric field:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&n_1=-\nabla\cdot(n_0\mathbf{x}_1)=-ik_xn_0x_1 \\
&\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}_1)=ik_x\epsilon_0E_{1}=-en_{1e}=eik_xn_0x_1 \\
\Rightarrow& E_{1}=\frac{en_0x_1}{\epsilon_0}
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting into the momentum equation, we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{x}_1+{\Omega_e}^2x_1&=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_{1}-\frac{\nabla P_1}{n_0m_e}  \\
&=-{\omega_{pe}}^2 x_1-{k_x}^2{v_{th,e}}^2x_1
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(v_{th,e}=\sqrt{k_BT_e/m_e}\). This gives us (You can gain a
sense of the equivalent force law from the dispersion relation.)

\[
\omega^2={\omega_{pe}}^2+{\Omega_e}^2+{k_x}^2{v_{th,e}}^2
\]

This is also equivalent to the dielectric function

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{\omega^2-{\Omega_{e}}^2-{k_x}^2{v_{th,e}}^2}
\]

\hypertarget{wave-particle-interactions}{%
\section{Wave-Particle Interactions}\label{wave-particle-interactions}}

Charged particles can exchange the energy with the wave electric field
both parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field (\emph{Landau
resonance}). Figure~\ref{fig:wave_particle} left and middle panels show
these resonance types and the associated parts of the distribution
function schematically. The resonance parameters for the Landau and
cyclotron resonances are

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:landau_resonance}{}{
\xi_\text{L} = \frac{\omega}{k_\parallel v_{\text{th},s}}
}\label{eq:landau_resonance}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cyclotron_resonance}{}{
\xi_\text{C} = \frac{\omega-\Omega_s}{k_\parallel v_(\text{th},s)}
}\label{eq:cyclotron_resonance}\end{equation}

Here the frequency \(\omega\) is measured in the plasma rest frame.
\(\Omega_s\) denotes the cyclotron frequency of particle species \(s\)
(ion species and electrons), \(k_\parallel\) the parallel component of
the wavevector, and \(v_{\text{th},s}\) the particle thermal speed of
species \(s\). In general, the resonance parameter can be defined for
arbitrary harmonics of the cyclotron frequency \(m=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:harmonic_resonance}{}{
\xi^{(m)} = \frac{\omega - m\Omega_s}{k_\parallel v_{\text{th},s}}
}\label{eq:harmonic_resonance}\end{equation}

velocity distribution functions. Courtesy of Yasuhito
Narita.}\label{fig:wave_particle}
}
\end{figure}

Note that the resonance parameters above are defined for a Maxwellian
plasma. A correction is needed when treating a non-Maxwellian plasma to
find the suitable velocity-space gradient for the resonance. The
resonance is efficient when the parameter \(\xi_\text{L}\) or
\(\xi_\text{C}\) is on the order of unity. Strictly speaking, the wave
damping (or particle acceleration) is most efficient, typically for
\(1<\xi<5\). The upper limit is not exact, but the resonance becomes
gradually inefficient at larger values of \(\xi\). For \(\xi<1\) the
particle motion is slower than the wave propagation and the particles do
not have a sufficient time for exchanging energy with the wave electric
field. For \(\xi>5\) there are increasingly fewer particles with higher
velocities for the resonance (higher than the thermal speed).

\hypertarget{pitch-angle-scattering}{%
\subsection{Pitch Angle Scattering}\label{pitch-angle-scattering}}

Charged particles can be scattered by the wave electric and magnetic
fields incoherently, and the scattering deforms the velocity
distribution function along the co-centric contours centered at the wave
phase speed (Figure~\ref{fig:wave_particle}, right panel). The reason
for the deformation is that the particle kinetic energy \(K_{wv}\) (per
unit mass) does not change in the co-moving frame with the apparent wave
phase speed in the parallel direction to the mean magnetic field:

\[
K_{wv} = \frac{1}{2}\left[ v_\perp^2 + \left( v_\parallel - \frac{\omega}{k_\parallel} \right)^2 \right] = \text{const}.
\]

The co-centric deformation of the distribution function achieves a
quasi-linear equilibrium in that the velocity--space gradient becomes
zero (plateau formation) in the pitch angle directions. For example, in
the solar wind ions are found to be resonating with obliquely
propagating Alfvén/ion cyclotron waves. Note that the relevant phase
speed is \(\omega/k_\parallel\), and is different from the true phase
speed \(\omega/k\). The perpendicular component of the wavevector
\(k_\perp\) does not play a role in pitch angle scattering.

\hypertarget{sec:whistler}{%
\section{Whistler Wave}\label{sec:whistler}}

Whistler waves are a type of electron-scale plasma waves that contribute
to electron scattering, acceleration, and energy transport. They are
excited by the electron temperature anisotropy
(\(T_{e\perp}/T_{e\parallel}>1\) ???) and shape the electron velocity
distribution function through wave-particle interactions. (Ren+ 2020)
Therefore, properties of whistler waves relate closely to electron-scale
physics in magnetic reconnection. According to (Zhao 2017), the whistler
wave can be described by \emph{electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD?)} on
timescales of \(2\pi/\Omega_{ce}<t<2\pi/\Omega{LH}\) and spatial scales
of \(L<\lambda_i\), where the ions are assumed as a motionless
neutralizing background. When magnetic field lines are fully frozen into
the electron fluid, the whistler wave follows the dispersion relation
\(\omega=\Omega_{ce}\lambda_e^2 k^2\cos\theta\). The dispersion relation
becomes
\(\omega=\Omega_{ce}\lambda_e^2 k^2\cos\theta/(1+\lambda_e^2 k^2)\) as
the electron inertia is contained in Ohm's law. Zhao further extended
the model by taking the electron thermal pressure and the displacement
current into the EMHD model.

We first see the derivations of whistler wave dispersion relation in
Section~\ref{sec:CPDR} at the low frequency MHD limit. Another way to
derive the whistler mode dispersion relation, which is probably easier,
is to include the Hall term from the generalized Ohm's law:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{U}\times\mathbf{B} + \frac{1}{ne}\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}
\]

Using Ampère's law and retaining only the Hall term leads to the
equation

\[
\dot{\mathbf{B}} = -\frac{1}{\mu_0 ne}\nabla\times[(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B}]
\]

Performing linearization and assuming that the magnetic field is
parallel to the z-axis and its perturbation is only in x and y, the last
equation becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
\omega B_{1x} &= -i\frac{k_z^2 B_0}{\mu_0 ne} B_{1y} \\
\omega B_{1y} &=  i\frac{k_z^2 B_0}{\mu_0 ne} B_{1x}
\end{aligned}
\]

which easily yields

\[
\omega = \frac{B_0}{\mu_0 ne} k_z^2
\]

The dispersion property of whistler waves makes it a problem for hybrid
simulations (Section~\ref{sec:finite_e_mass}).

\section{The Meaning of f(v)}\label{the-meaning-of-fv}}

The fluid theory we have been using so far is the simplest description
of a plasma; it is indeed fortunate that this approximation is
sufficiently accurate to describe the majority of observed phenomena.
There are some phenomena, however, for which a fluid treatment is
inadequate. For these, we need to consider the velocity distribution
function \(f(\mathbf{v})\) for each species; this treatment is called
kinetic theory. In fluid theory, the dependent variables are functions
of only four independent variables: \(x, y, z,\) and \(t\). This is
possible because the velocity distribution of each species is assumed to
be Maxwellian everywhere and can therefore be uniquely specified by only
one number, the temperature \(T\). Since collisions can be rare in
high-temperature plasmas, deviations from thermal equilibrium can be
maintained for relatively long times. As an example, consider two
velocity distributions \(f_1(v_x)\) and \(f_2(v_x)\) in a
one-dimensional system. (Figure~\ref{fig:distributions_1d}) These two
distributions will have entirely different behaviors, but as long as the
areas under the curves are the same, fluid theory does not distinguish
between them.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:distributions_1d}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/distributions_1d.png}
\caption{Examples of non-Maxwellian distribution
functions}\label{fig:distributions_1d}
}
\end{figure}

The density is a function of four scalar variables:
\(n=n(\mathbf{r}, t)\). When we consider velocity distributions, we have
seven independent variables: \(f = f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t)\). By
\(f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t)\), we mean that the number of particles
per meter cubed at position \(\mathbf{r}\) and time \(t\) with velocity
components between \(v_x\) and \(v_x + dv_x\), \$v\_y and
\(v_y + dv_y\), and \(v_z\) and \(v_z + dv_z\) is

\[
f(x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z, t) dv_x dv_y dv_z
\]

The integral of this is written in several equivalent ways:

\[
\begin{aligned}
n(\mathbf{r}, t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dv_x \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dv_y \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dv_z f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t)d^3v \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t) d\mathbf{v}
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that \(d\mathbf{v}\) is not a vector; it stands for a
three-dimensional volume element in velocity space. If \(f\) is
normalized so that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:f_normalization}{}{
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t) d\mathbf{v} = 1
}\label{eq:f_normalization}\end{equation}

it is a probability, which we denote by \(\hat{f}\). Thus

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:f_normalization_dimensionless}{}{
f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t) = n(\mathbf{r}, t)\hat{f}(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t)
}\label{eq:f_normalization_dimensionless}\end{equation}

Note that \(\hat{f}\) is still a function of seven variables, since the
shape of the distribution, as well as the density, can change with space
and time. From Equation~\ref{eq:f_normalization}, it is clear that
\(\hat{f}\) has the dimensions \((\text{m}/\text{s})^{-3}\); and
consequently, from Equation~\ref{eq:f_normalization_dimensionless}, f
has the dimensions \(\text{s}^3 \text{m}^{-6}\).

A particularly important distribution function is the Maxwellian:

\[
\hat{f}_m = (m/2\pi k_B T)^{3/2}\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)
\]

where

\[
v\equiv(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)^{1/2}\quad\text{and}\quad v_{th}\equiv(2k_B T/m)^{1/2}
\]

By using the definite integral

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp(-x^2)dx = \sqrt{\pi}
\]

one easily verifies that the integral of \(\hat{f}_m\) over
\(dv_x dv_y dv_z\) is unity.

A common question to ask is: why do we see Maxwellian/Gaussian/normal
distribution ubiquitously in nature? Well, this is related to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem}{central limit
theorem}: in many situations, when independent random variables are
summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal
distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally
distributed (e.g.~a biased coin which give 95\% head and 5\% tail).

There are several average velocities of a Maxwellian distribution that
are commonly used. The root-mean-square velocity is given by

\[
(\overline{v^2})^{1/2} = (3k_B T/m)^{1/2}
\]

The average magnitude of the velocity \(|v|\), or simply \(\bar{v}\), is
found as follows:

\[
\bar{v} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}v\hat{f}(\mathbf{v})d^3v
\]

Since \(\hat{f}_m\) is isotropic, the integral is most easily done in
spherical coordinates in v space. Since the volume element of each
spherical shell is \(4\pi v^2 \mathrm{d}v\), we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\bar{v} &= (m/2\pi k_B T)^{3/2}\int_0^\infty v[\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)]4\pi v^2 \mathrm{d}v \\
&= (\pi v_{th}^2)^{-3/2} 4\pi v_{th}^4 \int_0^\infty [\exp(-y^2)]y^3 dy
\end{aligned}
\]

The definite integral has a value 1/2, found by integration by parts.
Thus

\[
\bar{v} = 2\sqrt{\pi}v_{th} = 2(2k_B T/\pi m)^{1/2}
\]

The velocity component in a \emph{single direction}, say \(v_x\), has a
different average. Of course, \(\bar{v}_x\) vanishes for an isotropic
distribution; but \(|\bar{v}_x|\) does not:

\[
|\bar{v}_x| = \int |v_x|\hat{f}_m(\mathbf{v})\mathrm{d}^3 v = \pi^{-1/2}v_{th} = (2k_B T/\pi m)^{1/2}
\]

To summarize: for a Maxwellian,

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_{rms} &= (3k_B T/m)^{1/2} \\
|\bar{v}| &= 2(2k_B T/\pi m)^{1/2} \\
|\bar{v}_x| &= (2k_B T/\pi m)^{1/2} \\
\bar{v}_x &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

For an isotropic distribution like a Maxwellian, we can define another
function \(g(v)\) which is a function of the scalar magnitude of
\(\mathbf{v}\) such that

\[
\int_0^\infty g(v) \mathrm{d}v = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\mathbf{v})\mathrm{d}v
\]

For a Maxwellian, we see that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:g_dist}{}{
g(v) = 4\pi n (m/2\pi k_B T)^{3/2} v^2 \exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)
}\label{eq:g_dist}\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:f_g} shows the difference between \(g(v)\) and a
one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution \(f(v_x)\). Although \(f(v_x)\)
is maximum for \(v_x=0\), \(g(v)\) is zero for \(v=0\).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:f_g}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/f_g.png}
\caption{One- and three-dimensional Maxwellian velocity
distributions.}\label{fig:f_g}
}
\end{figure}

This is just a consequence of the vanishing of the volume in phase space
for \(v=0\). Sometimes \(g(v)\) is carelessly denoted by \(f(v)\), as
distinct from \(f(\mathbf{v})\); but \(g(v)\) is a different function of
its argument than \(f(\mathbf{v})\) is of its argument. From eq:g\_dist,
it is clear that \(g(v)\) has dimensions \(\text{s}/\text{m}^4\).

It is often convenient to present the distribution function as a
function of energy instead of velocity. If all energy is kinetic, the
energy is simply obtained from \(W=mv^2/2\). In the case the particles
are in the external electric potential field \(U=-q\varphi\) the total
energy of particles is \(W=mv^2/2+U\) and the Maxwellian distribution is

\[
f(v) = n\Big(\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T}\Big)^{3/2}\exp\Big(-\frac{W}{k_B T}\Big)
\]

This can be written as the energy distribution (???):

\[
g(W) = 4\pi\Big[ \frac{2(W-U)}{m^3} \Big]^{1/2} f(v)
\]

The normalization factor is determined by requiring that the integration
of the energy distribution over all energies gives the density.

Velocity and energy distribution functions cannot be measured directly.
Instead, the observed quantity is \emph{the particle flux to the
detector}. Particle flux is defined as the number density of particles
multiplied by the velocity component normal to the surface. We define
the \emph{differential flux} of particles traversing a unit area per
unit time, unit solid angle (in spherical coordinates the differential
solid angle is \(d\Omega = \sin\theta d\theta d\phi\)) and unit energy
as \(J(W,\Omega, \alpha, \mathbf{r},t)\). (\(\alpha\) is species?) The
units of \(J\) are normally given as
\((\text{m}^2\text{sr}\text{s}\text{eV})^{-1}\). Note that in literature
\(\text{cm}\) is often used instead of \(\text{m}\) and, depending on
the actual energy range considered, electron volts are often replaced by
keV, MeV, or GeV.

Let us next define how differential particle flux and distribution
function are related to each other. We can write the number density in a
differential velocity element (in spherical coordinates
\(d^3v=v^2dvd\Omega\)) as (\(dn=f(\alpha,\mathbf{r},t)v^2dvd\Omega\)).
By multiplying this with \(v\) we obtain another expression for the
differential flux \(f(\alpha,\mathbf{r},t)v^3dvd\Omega\). Comparing with
our eailier definition of the differential flux we obtain

\[
J(W,\Omega, \alpha, \mathbf{r},t)dWd\Omega = f(\alpha,\mathbf{r},t)v^3dvd\Omega
\]

Since \(\mathrm{d}W=mvdv\) we can write the relationship between the
differential flux and the distribution function as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:diff_flux_dist}{}{
J(W,\Omega, \alpha, \mathbf{r},t) = \frac{v^2}{m}f
}\label{eq:diff_flux_dist}\end{equation}

One application of the differential flux is the \emph{particle
precipitation flux}. With the idea of loss lone, we have a cone of
particles that moves along the field lines and can propagate down to the
ionosphere, and each shell from \(v\) to \(v+\mathrm{d}v\) corresponds
to a specific energy range. This is something we can measure close to
the ground and use to infer the plasma properties in the magnetosphere.

\hypertarget{kappa-distribution}{%
\subsection{Kappa Distribution}\label{kappa-distribution}}

The Maxwellian distribution is probably the most studied one
theoretically, but may not be the most commonly observed distribution in
a collisionless space plasma system. In recent years, another
distribution named
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-013-9982-9}{Kappa
distribution} has gained more attention.

Distribution functions are often nearly Maxwellian at low energies, but
they decrease more slowly at high energies. At higher energies the
distribution is described better by a power law than by an exponential
decay of the Maxwell distribution. Such a behavior is not surprising if
we remember that the Coulomb collision frequency decreases with
increasing temperature as \(T^{-3/2}\)
(Equation~\ref{eq:coulomb_resistivity_maxwellian_correction}). Hence, it
takes longer time for fast particles to reach Maxwellian distirbution
than for slow particles. The kappa distribution has the form

\[
f_\kappa(W) = n\Big( \frac{m}{2\pi\kappa W_0} \Big)^{3/2}\frac{\Gamma(\kappa + 1)}{\Gamma(\kappa-1/2)}\Big( 1+\frac{W}{\kappa W_0} \Big)^{-(\kappa+1)}
\]

Here \(W_0\) is the energy at the peak of the particle flux and
\(\Gamma\) is the gamma function. When \(\kappa\gg 1\) the kappa
distribution approaches the Maxwellian distribution. When \(\kappa\) is
smaller but \(>1\) the distribution has a high-energy tail. A thorough
review is given by (\protect\hyperlink{ref-livadiotis2013}{Livadiotis \&
McComas, 2013}).

\hypertarget{equations-of-kinetic-theory}{%
\section{Equations of Kinetic
Theory}\label{equations-of-kinetic-theory}}

The fundamental equation which \(f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t)\) has to
satisfy is the Boltzmann equation:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:boltzmann}{}{
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla f +\frac{\mathbf{F}}{m}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = \Big( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Big)_c
}\label{eq:boltzmann}\end{equation}

Here \(\mathbf{F}\) is the force acting on the particles, and
\((\partial f/\partial t)_C\) is the time rate of change of \(f\) due to
collisions\footnote{For simulations, the effect of numerical diffusion
  may be treated as one type of ``collision''.}. The symbol \(\nabla\)
stands, as usual, for the gradient in \((x, y, z)\) space. The symbol
\(\partial/\partial\mathbf{v}\) or \(\nabla_v\) stands for the gradient
in velocity space:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = \hat{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial v_x} + \hat{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial v_y} + \hat{z}\frac{\partial}{\partial v_z}
\]

In a sufficiently hot plasma, collisions can be neglected. If,
furthermore, the force \(\mathbf{F}\) is entirely electromagnetic,
Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} takes the special form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:vlasov}{}{
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla f +\frac{\mathbf{F}}{m}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = 0
}\label{eq:vlasov}\end{equation}

This is called the \emph{Vlasov equation}. Because of its comparative
simplicity, this is the equation most commonly studied in kinetic
theory. When there are collisions with neutral atoms, the collision term
in Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} can be approximated by

\[
\Big( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Big)_c = \frac{f_n - f}{\tau}
\]

where \(f_n\) is the distribution function of the neutral atoms, and
\(\tau\) is a constant collision time. This is called the \emph{Krook
collision term}. It is the kinetic generalization of the collision term
in Eq. (5.5) in F. F. Chen's book. When there are Coulomb collisions,
Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} can be approximated by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fokker_planck}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{v}}\cdot(f\left<\Delta\mathbf{v}\right>)\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\mathbf{v}\partial\mathbf{v}}:(f\left<\Delta\mathbf{v}\Delta\mathbf{v}\right>)
}\label{eq:fokker_planck}\end{equation}

This is called the \emph{Fokker-Planck equation}; it takes into account
binary Coulomb collisions only. Here, \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) is the change
of velocity in a collision, and Equation~\ref{eq:fokker_planck} is a
shorthand way of writing a rather complicated expression. The colon
operator \(\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}:\mathbf{c}\mathbf{d} = a_ib_jc_id_j\).

The fact that \(\mathrm{d}f/\mathrm{d}t\) is constant in the absence of
collisions means that particles follow the contours of constant \(f\) as
they move around in phase space. As an example of how these contours can
be used, consider the beam-plasma instability of Section ???. In the
unperturbed plasma, the electrons all have velocity \(v_0\), and the
contour of constant \(f\) is a straight line. The function \(f(x, v_x)\)
is a wall rising out of the plane of the paper at \(v_x=v_0\). The
electrons move along the trajectory shown. When a wave develops, the
electric field \(\mathbf{E}_1\) causes electrons to suffer changes in
\(v_x\) as they stream along. The trajectory then develops a sinusoidal
ripple (Figure~\ref{fig:beam_e_dist_1d} B). This ripple travels at the
phase velocity, not the particle velocity. Particles stay on the curve
as they move relative to the wave. If \(\mathbf{E}_1\) becomes very
large as the wave grows, and if there are a few collisions, some
electrons will be trapped in the electrostatic potential of the wave. In
coordinate space, the wave potential appears as in
Figure~\ref{fig:wave_potential}. In phase space, \(f(x, v_x)\) will have
peaks wherever there is a potential trough
(Figure~\ref{fig:contour_dist}). Since the contours of \(f\) are also
electron trajectories, one sees that some electrons move in closed
orbits in phase space; these are just the trapped electrons.

Electron trapping is a nonlinear phenomenon which cannot be treated by
straightforward solution of the Vlasov equation. However, electron

\section{Derivation of the Fluid
Equations}\label{derivation-of-the-fluid-equations}}

This has been repeated multiple times.

The fluid equations we have been using are simply moments of the
Boltzmann equation. The lowest moment is obtained by integrating
Equation~\ref{eq:vlasov} with \(\mathbf{F}\) specialized to the Lorentz
force:

The energy equation derivation can be found in
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09354}{An introductory guide to fluid

\hypertarget{sec:landau}{%
\section{Plasma Oscillations and Landau Damping}\label{sec:landau}}

As an elementary illustration of the use of the Vlasov equation, we
shall derive the dispersion relation for electron plasma oscillations,
which is originally treated from the fluid point of view. This
derivation will require a knowledge of contour integration.

In zeroth order, we assume a uniform plasma with a distribution
\(f_0(\mathbf{v})\), and we let \(\mathbf{B}_0 = \mathbf{E}_0 = 0\). In
first order, we denote the perturbation in
\(f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t)\) by \(f_1(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t)\):

\[
f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t) = f_0(\mathbf{v}) + f_1(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t)
\]

Since \(\mathbf{v}\) is now an independent variable and is not to be
linearized, the first-order Vlasov equation for electron is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:vlasov_1st}{}{
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla f_1 - \frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_1\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = 0
}\label{eq:vlasov_1st}\end{equation}

As before, we assume the ions are massive and fixed and that the waves
are plane waves in the x direction \(f_1 \propto e^{i(kx - \omega t)}\).
Then the linearized Vlasov equation becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega f_1 + ikv_x fx &= \frac{e}{m}E_x\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v_x} \\
f_1 &= \frac{ieE_x}{m}\frac{\partial f_0/\partial v_x}{\omega - kv_x}
\end{aligned}
\]

Poisson's equation gives

\[
\epsilon_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}_1 = ik\epsilon_0 E_x = -en_1 = -e\int\int\int f_1 d^3v
\]

Substituting for \(f_1\) and dividing by \(ik\epsilon_0 E_x\), we have

\[
1 = -\frac{e^2}{km\epsilon_0}\int\int\int \frac{\partial f_0/\partial v_x}{\omega - k v_x}d^3v
\]

A factor \(n_0\) can be factored out if we replace \(f_0\) by a
normalized function \(\hat{f}_0\):

\[
1 = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{k}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv_z\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv_y\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial \hat{f}_0(v_x, v_y, v_z)/\partial v_x}{\omega- k v_x}dv_x
\]

If \(f_0\) is a Maxwellian or some other factorable distribution, the
integration over \(v_y\) and \(v_z\) can be carried out easily. What
remains is the one-dimensional distribution \(\hat{f}_0(v_x)\). For
instance, a one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution is

\[
\hat{f}_m(v_x) = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T}} e^{\frac{-mv_x^2}{2 k_B T}}
\]

Since we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem we may drop the
subscript x, begin careful not to confuse \(v\) (which is really
\(v_x\)) with the total velocity \(v\) used earlier:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:dispersion_0th}{}{
1 = \frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial \hat{f}_0/\partial v}{v - \omega/k}\mathrm{d}v
}\label{eq:dispersion_0th}\end{equation}

Here, \(\hat{f}_0\) is understood to be a one-dimensional distribution
function, the integrations over \(v_y\) and \(v_z\) having been made.
This equation holds for any equilibrium distribution \(\hat{f}_0(v)\).

The integral in this equation is not straightforward to evaluate because
of the singularity at \(v=\omega/k\). One might think that the
singularity would be of no concern, because in practice \(\omega\) is
almost always never real; waves are usually slightly damped by
collisions or are amplified by some instability mechanisms. Since the
velocity \(v\) is a real quantity, the denominator never vanishes.
Landau was the first to treat this equation properly. He found that even
though the singularity lies off the path of integration, its presence
introduces an important modification to the plasma wave dispersion
relation --- an effect not predicted by the fluid theory.

Consider an initial value problem in which the plasma is given a
sinusoidal perturbation, and therefore \(k\) is real. If the
perturbation grows or decays, \(\omega\) will be complex. This integral
must be treated as a contour integral in the complex \(v\) plane.
Possible contours are shown for (a) an unstable wave, with
\(\Im(\omega) > 0\), and (b) a dampled wave, with \(\Im(\omega) < 0\).
Normally, one would evaluate the line integral along the real \(v\) axis
by the residue theorem:

\[
\int_{C_1} G \mathrm{d}v + \int_{C_2} G \mathrm{d}v = 2\pi i R(\omega/k)
\]

where \(G\) is the integrand, \(C_1\) is the path along the real axis,
\(C_2\) is the semicircle at infinity, and \(R(\omega/k)\) is the
residue at \(\omega/k\). This works if the integral over \(C_2\)
vanishes. Unfortunately, this does not happen for a Maxwellian
distribution, which contains the factor

\[
\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)
\]

This factor becomes large for \(v\rightarrow \pm i \infty\), and the
contribution from \(C_2\) cannot be neglected. Landau showed that when
the problem is properly treated as an initial value problem the correct
contour to use is the curve \(C_1\) passing below the singularity. This
integral must in general be evaluated numerically.

Although an exact analysis of this problem is complicated, we can obtain
an approximate dispersion relation for the case of large phase velocity
and weak damping. In this case, the pole at \(\omega/k\) lies near the
real \(v\) axis. The contour prescribed by Landau is then a straight
line along the \(\Re(v)\) axis with a small semicircle around the pole.
In going around the pole, one obtains \(2\pi i\) time half the residue
there. Then Equation~\ref{eq:dispersion_0th} becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:landau_residue}{}{
1 = \frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2} \Big[ P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial\hat{f}_0/\partial v}{v - (\omega/k)}\mathrm{d}v + i\pi \frac{\partial\hat{f}_0}{\partial v}\biggr\rvert_{v=\omega/k} \Big]
}\label{eq:landau_residue}\end{equation}

where \(P\) stands for the Cauchy principal value. To evaluate this, we
integrate along the real \(v\) axis but stop just before encountering
the pole. If the phase velocity \(v_\phi = \omega/k\) is sufficiently
large, as we assume, there will not be much contribution from the
neglected part of the contour, since both \(\hat{f}_0\) and
\(\partial\hat{f}_0/\partial v\) are very small there. The integral
above can be evaluated by integration by parts:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial\hat{f}_0}{\partial v}\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{v - v_\phi} = \Big[ \frac{\hat{f}_0}{v-v_\phi} \Big]_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{-\hat{f}_0 \mathrm{d}v}{(v-v_\phi)^2} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\hat{f}_0 \mathrm{d}v}{(v-v_\phi)^2}
\]

Since this is just an average of \((v-v_\phi)^{-2}\) over the
distribution, the real part of the dispersion relation can be written

\[
1 = \frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2} \overline{(v-v_\phi)^{-2}}
\]

Since \(v_\phi \gg v\) has been assumed, we can expand
\((v-v_\phi)^{-2}\):

\[
(v-v_\phi)^{-2} = v_\phi^{-2}\Big( 1 - \frac{v}{v_\phi} \Big)^{-2} = v_\phi^{-2}\Big( 1 + \frac{2v}{v_\phi} + \frac{3v^2}{v_\phi^2} + \frac{4v^3}{v_\phi^3} + ... \Big)
\]

The odd terms vanish upon taking the average, and we have

\[
\overline{(v-v_\phi)^{-2}} \approx v_\phi^{-2} \Big( 1 + \frac{3\overline{v^2}}{v_\phi^2} \Big)
\]

We now let \(\hat{f}_0\) be Maxwellian and evaluate \(\overline{v^2}\).
Remembering that \(v\) here is an abbreviation for \(v_x\), we can write

\[
\frac{1}{2}m\overline{v_x^2} = \frac{1}{2}k_B T_e
\]

there being only one degree of freedom. The dispersion relation then
becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
1 &= \frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\frac{k^2}{\omega^2}\Big( 1+ 3\frac{k^2}{\omega^2}\frac{k_B T_e}{m} \Big) \\
\omega^2 &= \omega_p^2 + \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\frac{3k_B T_e}{m}k^2
\end{aligned}
\]

If the thermal correction is small (i.e.~the second term on the
right-hand side is small, such that \(\omega \approx \omega_p\)), we may
replace \(\omega^2\) by \(\omega_p^2\) in the second term. We then have

\[
\omega^2 = \omega_p^2 + \frac{3k_B T_e}{m}k^2
\]

which is the same as that been obtained from the fluid equations with
\(\gamma=3\).

We now return to the imaginary term in the dispersion relation. In
evaluating this small term, it will be sufficiently accurate to neglect
the thermal correction to the real part of \(\omega\) and let
\(\omega^2\approx \omega_p^2\). From the evaluation of the real part
above we see that the principle value of the integral is approximately
\(k^2/\omega^2\). The dispersion relation now becomes

\[
1 = \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} + i\pi\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\frac{\partial\hat{f}_0}{\partial v}\biggr\rvert_{v=v_\phi}
\]

\[
\omega^2 \Big( 1 - i\pi\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\frac{\partial\hat{f}_0}{\partial v}\biggr\rvert_{v=v_\phi} \Big) = \omega_p^2
\]

Treating the imaginary term as small, we can bring it to the right-hand
side and take the square root by Taylar series expansion. We then obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:landau}{}{
\omega = \omega_p\Big( 1 + i\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\frac{\partial\hat{f}_0}{\partial v}\biggr\rvert_{v=v_\phi} \Big)
}\label{eq:landau}\end{equation}

If \(\hat{f}_0\) is a one-dimensional Maxwellian, we have

\[
\frac{\partial\hat{f}_0}{\partial v} = (\pi v_{th}^2)^{-1/2} \Big( \frac{-2v}{v_{th}^2} \Big) \exp\Big( \frac{-v^2}{v_{th}^2} \Big) = -\frac{2v}{\sqrt{\pi}v_{th}}\exp\Big( \frac{-v^2}{v_{th}^2} \Big)
\]

We may approximate \(v_\phi\) by \(\omega_p/k\) in the coefficient, but
in the exponent we must keep the thermal correction in the real part of
the dispersion relation. The damping is then given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Im(\omega) &= -\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\frac{2\omega_p}{k\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{v_{th}^3}\exp\Big( \frac{-\omega^2}{k^2 v_{th}^2} \Big) \\
&= -\sqrt{\pi}\omega_p \Big( \frac{\omega_p}{kv_{th}} \Big)^3 \exp\Big( \frac{-\omega_p^2}{k^2 v_{th}^2}\Big)\exp\Big( \frac{-3}{2} \Big) \\
\Im\Big(\frac{\omega}{\omega_p}\Big) &= -0.22 \sqrt{\pi}\Big( \frac{\omega_p}{kv_{th}} \Big)^3 \exp\Big( \frac{-1}{2k^2\lambda_D^2} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

Since \(\Im(\omega)\) is negative, there is a collisionless damping of
plasma waves; this is called \emph{Landau damping}. As is evident from
the expression, this damping is extremely small for small
\(k\lambda_D\), but becomes important for
\(k\lambda_D = \mathcal{O}(1)\). This effect is connected with \(f_1\),
the distortion of the distribution function caused by the wave.

\hypertarget{sec:landau_damping}{%
\section{The Meaning of Landau Damping}\label{sec:landau_damping}}

\textbf{The theoretical discovery of wave damping without energy
dissipation by collisions is perhaps the most astounding result of
plasma physics research}. That this is a real effect has been
demonstrated in the laboratory. Although a simple physical explanation
for this damping is now available, it is a triumph of applied
mathematics that this unexpected effect was first discovered purely
mathematically in the course of a careful analysis of a contour
integral. Landau damping is a characteristic of collisionless plasmas,
but it may also have application in other fields. For instance, in the
kinetic treatment of galaxy formation, stars can be considered as atoms
of a plasma interacting via gravitational rather than electromagnetic
forces. Instabilities of the gas of stars can cause spiral arms to form,
but this process is limited by Landau damping.

To see what is responsible for Landau damping, we first notice that
\(\Im(\omega)\) arises from the pole at \(v=v_\phi\). Consequently, the
effect is connected with those particles in the distribution that have a
velocity nearly equal to the phase velocity --- the ``resonant
particles''. These particles travel along with the wave and do not see a
rapidly fluctuating electric field: they can, therefore, exchange energy
with the wave effectively. The easiest way to understand this exchange
of energy is to picture a surfer trying to catch an ocean wave.
(Warning: this picture is only for directing our thinking along the
right lines; it does not correctly explain the damping.) If the
surfboard is not moving, it merely bobs up and down as the wave goes by
and does not gain any energy on the average. Similarly, a boat propelled
much faster than the wave cannot exchange much energy with the wave.
However, if the surfboard has almost the same velocity as the wave, it
can be caught and pushed along by the wave; this is, after all, the main
purpose of the exercise. In that case, the surfboard gains energy, and
therefore the wave must lose energy and is damped. On the other hand, if
the surfboard should be moving slightly faster than the wave, it would
push on the wave as it moves uphill; then the wave could gain energy. In
a plasma, there are electrons both faster and slower than the wave. A
Maxwellian distribution, however, has more slow electrons than fast
ones. Consequently, there are more particles taking energy from the wave
than vice versa, and the wave is damped. As particles with
\(v\approx v_\phi\) are trapped in the wave, \(f(v)\) is flattened near
the phase velocity. This distortion is \(f_1(v)\) which we calculated.
As seen in Fig (ADD IT!), the perturbed distribution function contains
the same number of particles but has gained total energy (at the expense
of the wave).

From this discussion, one can surmise that if \(f_0(v)\) contained more
fast particles than slow particles, a wave can be excited. Indeed, from
the expression of \(\omega\) above, it is apparent that \(\Im(\omega)\)
is positive if \(\partial\hat{f}_0/\partial v\) is positive at
\(v=v_\phi\). Such a distribution is shown in Fig.7-19 (ADD IT!). Waves
with \(v_\phi\) in the region of positive slope will be unstable,
gaining energy at the expense of the particles. This is just the
finite-temperature analogy of the two stream instability. When there are
two cold (\(k_B T=0\)) electron streams in motion, \(f_0(v)\) consists
of two \(\delta\)-functions. This is clearly unstable because
\(\partial f_0/\partial v\) is infinite; and indeed, we found the
instability from fluid theory. When the streams have fnite temperature,
kinetic theory tells us that the relative densities and temperatures of
the two stream must be such as to have a region of positive
\(\partial f_0(v)/\partial v\) between them; more precisely, the total
distribution function must have a minimum for instability.

\textbf{The physical picture of a surfer catching waves is very
appealing, but it is not precise enough to give us a real understanding
of Landau damping}. There are actually two kinds of Landau damping. Both
kinds are independent of dissipative collisional mechanisms. If a
particle is caught in the potential well of a wave, the phenomenon is
called ``trapping''. As in the case of a surfer, particles can indeed
gain or lose energy in trapping. However, trapping does not lie within
the purview of the linear theory. That this is true can be seen from the
equation of motion

\[
m\ddot{x} = qE(x)
\]

If one evaluates \(E(x)\) by inserting the exact value of \(x\), the
equation would be nonlinear, since \(E(x)\) is somehting like
\(\sin kx\). What is done in linear theory is to use for \(x\) the
unperturbed orbit; i.e.~\(x=x_0 + v_0 t\). Then this becomes linear.
This approximation, however, is no longer valid when a particle is
trapped. When it encounters a potential hill large enough to reflect it,
its velocity and position are, of course, greatly affected by the wave
and are not close to their unperturbed values. In fluid theory, the
equation of motion is

\[
m\Big[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v} \Big] = q\mathbf{E}(x)
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{E}(x)\) is to be evaluated in the laboratory frame,
which is easy; but to make up for it, there is the
\((\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v}\) term. The neglect of
\((\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v}_1\) in linear theory amounts to
the same thing as using unperturbed orbits. In kinetic theory, the
nonlinear term that is neglected is, from the first-order Vlasov
Equation~\ref{eq:vlasov_1st},

\[
\frac{q}{m}E_1\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial v}
\]

When the particles are trapped, they reverse their direction of travel
relative to the wave, so the distribution function \(f(v)\) is greatly
disturbed near \(v=\omega/k\). This means that
\(\partial f_1/\partial v\) is comparable to
\(\partial f_0/\partial v\), and the term above is not negligible.
Hence, trapping is not in the linear theory.

When a wave grows to a large amplitude, collisionless damping with
trapping does occur. One then finds that the wave does not decay
monotonically; rather, the amplitude fluctuates during the decay as the
trapped particles bounce back and forth in the potential wells. This is
\emph{nonlinear} Landau damping. Since the result before was derived
from a \emph{linear} theory, it must arise from a different physical
effect. The question is: can untrapped electrons moving close to the
phase velocity of the wave exchange energy with the wave? Before giving
the answer, let us examine the energy of such electrons.

\hypertarget{the-kinetic-energy-of-a-beam-of-electrons}{%
\subsection{The Kinetic Energy of a Beam of
Electrons}\label{the-kinetic-energy-of-a-beam-of-electrons}}

We may divide the electron distribution \(f_0(v)\) into a large number
of monoenergetic beams. Consider one of these beams: it has unperturbed
velocity \(u\) and density \(n_u\). The velocity \(u\) may lie near
\(v_\phi\), so that this beam may consist of resonant electrons. We now
turn on a plasma oscillation \(E(x,t)\) and consider the kinetic energy
of the beam as it moves through the crests and troughs of the wave. The
wave is caused by a self-consistent motion of all the beams together. If
\(n_u\) is small enough (the number of beams large enough), the beam
being examined has a negligible effect on the wave and may be considered
as moving in a given field \(E(x,t)\). Let

\[
\begin{aligned}
E &= E_0\sin(kx-\omega t) = -d\phi/\mathrm{d}t \\
\phi &= (E_0/k)\cos(kx-\omega t)
\end{aligned}
\]

The linearized fluid equation for the beam is

\[
m\Big(\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} \Big) = -eE_0\sin(kx-\omega t)
\]

A possible solution is

\[
v_1 = -\frac{eE_0}{m}\frac{\cos(kx-\omega t)}{\omega-ku}
\]

This is the velocity modulation caused by the wave as the beam electrons
move past. To conserve particle flux, there is a corresponding
oscillation in density, given by the linearized continuity equation:

\[
\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial x} = -n_u\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}
\]

Since \(v_1\) is proportional to \(\cos(kx-\omega t)\), we can try
\(n_1 = \bar{n}_1 \cos(kx-\omega t)\). Substitution of this into the
above yields

\[
n_1 = -n_u\frac{eE_0 k}{m}\frac{\cos(kx-\omega t)}{(\omega-ku)^2}
\]

(\(n_1\) and \(v_1\) can be shown in a series of phase relation plots as
in Fig.7-21)(ADD IT!) one wavelength of \(E\) and of the potential
\(-e\phi\) seen by the beam electrons.

We may now compute the kinetic energy \(W_k\) of the beam:

\[
\begin{aligned}
W_k &= \frac{1}{2}m(n_u+n_1)(u+v_1)^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{2}m(n_u u^2 + n_uv_1^2 +2un_1v_1 + n_1u^2 + 2n_uuv_1 + n_1v_1^2)
\end{aligned}
\]

The last three terms contain odd powers of oscillating quantites, so
they will vanish when we average over a wavelength. The change in
\(W_k\) due to the wave is found by subtracting the first term, which is
the original energy. The average energy change is then

\[
\left<\Delta W_k \right> = \frac{1}{2}m\left<n_uv_1^2 + 2un_1v_1\right>
\]

From the form of \(v_1\), we have

\[
n_u\left< v_1^2 \right> = \frac{1}{2}n_u\frac{e^2E_0^2}{m^2(\omega-ku)^2}
\]

the factor \(\frac{1}{2}\) representing
\(\left< \cos^2(kx-\omega t) \right>\). Similarly, from the form of
\(n_1\),

\[
2u\left< n_1v_1 \right> = n_u\frac{e^2E_0^2 ku}{m^2(\omega - ku)^3}
\]

Consequently,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left<\Delta W_k \right> &= \frac{1}{4}mn_u \frac{e^2E_0^2}{m^2(\omega - ku)^2}\Big[ 1+\frac{2ku}{\omega-ku} \Big] \\
&= \frac{n_u}{4}\frac{e^2E_0^2}{m}\frac{\omega+ku}{m^2(\omega - ku)^3}
\end{aligned}
\]

This result shows that \(\left<\Delta W_k\right>\) depends on the frame
of the observer and that it does not change secularly with time.
Consider the picture of a frictionless block sliding over a
washboard-like surface. (ADD FIGURE!) In the frame of the washboard,
\(\left<\Delta W_k \right>\) is proportional to \(-(ku)^{-2}\), as seen
by taking \(\omega = 0\). It is intuitively clear that (1)
\(\left<\Delta W_k \right>\) is negative, since the block spends more
time at the peaks than at the valleys, and (2) the block does not gain
or lose energy on the average, \emph{once the oscillation is started}
(no time-dependence). Now if one goes into a frame in which the
washboard is movign with a steady velocity \(\omega/k\) (a velocity
unaffected by the motion of the block, since we have assumed that
\(n_u\) is negligibly small compared with the density of the whole
plasma), it is still true that the block does not gain or lose energy on
the average, once the oscillation is started. But the above equation
tells us that \(\left<\Delta W_k\right>\) depends on the velocity
\(\omega/k\), and hence on the frame of the observer. In particular, it
shows that a beam has less energy in the presence of the wave than in
its absence if \(\omega - ku<0\) or \(u>u_\phi\), and it has more energy
if \(\omega - ku>0\) or \(u<u_\phi\). The reason for this can be traced
back to the phase relation between \(n_1\) and \(v_1\). As Fig.7-23 (ADD
IT!) shows, \(W_k\) is a parabolic function of \(v\). As \(v\)
oscillates between \(u-|v_1|\) and \(u+|v_1|\), \(W_k\) will attain an
average value larger than the equilibrium value \(W_{k0}\), provided
that the particle spends an equal amount of time in each half of the
oscillation. This effect is the meaning of the first term
\(\frac{1}{2}m\left< n_uv_1^2 \right>\), which is positive definite. The
second term \(\frac{1}{2}m\left< 2un_1v_1 \right>\) is a correction due
to the fact that the particle does not distribution its time equally. In
Fig.7-21 (ADD IT!), one sees that both electrons a and b spend more time
at the top the potential hill than at the bottom, but electron a reaches
that point after a period of deceleration, so that \(v_1\) is negative
there, while electron b reaches that point after a period of
acceleration (to the right), so that \(v_1\) is positive there. This
effect causes \(\left<W_k\right>\) to change sign at \(u=v_\phi\).

\hypertarget{the-effect-of-initial-conditions}{%
\subsection{The Effect of Initial
Conditions}\label{the-effect-of-initial-conditions}}

The result we have just derived, however, still has nothing to do with
linear Landau damping. Damping requires a continuous increase of \(W_k\)
at the expense of wave energy, but we have found that
\(\left<\Delta W_k\right>\) for untrapped particles is contant in time.
If neither the untrapped particles nor the trapped particles are
responsible for linear Landau damping, what is? The answer can be
gleaned form the following observation: if \(\left<\Delta W_k\right>\)
is positive, say, there must have been a time when it was increasing.
Indeed, there are particles in the original distribution which have
velocities so close to \(v_\phi\) that at time \(t\) they have not yet
gone a half wavelength relative to the wave. For these particles, one
cannot take the average \(\left<\Delta W_k\right>\). These particles can
absorb energy from the wave and are properly called the ``resonant''
particles. As time goes on, the number of resonant electrons decreases,
since an increasing number will have shifted more than
\(\frac{1}{2}\lambda\) from their orginal positions. The damping rate,
however, can stay constant, since the amplitude is now smaller, and it
takes fewer electrons to maintain a constant damping rate.

The effect of the initial conditions is most easily seen form a
phase-space diagram (Fig.7-24)(ADD IT with Luxor?).

\hypertarget{a-physical-derivation-of-landau-damping}{%
\section{A Physical Derivation of Landau
Damping}\label{a-physical-derivation-of-landau-damping}}

We are now in a position to derive the Landau damping rate recourse to
contour integration. Although Landau's derivation of collisionless
damping was short and neat, it was not clear that it concerned a
physically observable phenomenon until J. M. Dawson gave the longer,
intuitive derivation which is paraphrased in this section. As before, we
divide the plasma up into beams of velocity \(u\) and density \(n_u\),
and examine their motion in a wave

\[
E = E_1 \sin(kx-\omega t)
\]

From the derivations in the previous section, the velocity of each beam
is

\[
v_1 = -\frac{eE_1}{m}\frac{\cos(kx-\omega t)}{\omega-ku}
\]

This solution satisfies the equation of motion, but it does not satisfy
the initial condition \(v_1 = 0\) at \(t = 0\). It is clear that this
initial condition must be imposed; otherwise, \(v_1\) would be very
large in the vicinity of \(u=\omega/k\), and the plasma would be in a
specially prepared state initially. We can fix up the solution to
satisfy the initial condition by adding an arbitrary function of
\(kx-kut\). The composite solution would still satisfy the equation of
motion because the operator on the left-hand side, when applied to
\(f(kx-kut)\), gives zero. Obviously, to get \(v_1 = 0\) at \(t=0\), the
function \(f(kx-kut)\) must be taken to be \(-\cos(kx-kut)\). Thus we
have, instead of the expression above,

\[
v_1 = \frac{-eE_1}{m}\frac{\cos(kx-\omega t) - \cos(kx-kut)}{\omega-ku}
\]

Next, we must solve the equation of continuity for \(n_1\), again
subject to the initial condition \(n_1=0\) at \(t=0\). Since we are now
much cleverer than before, we may try a solution of the form

\[
n_1 = \bar{n}_1[\cos(kx-\omega t) - \cos(kx-kut)]
\]

Inserting this into the equation of continuity and using the expression
for \(v_1\) above, we find

\[
\bar{n}_1 \sin(kx-\omega t) = -n_u\frac{eE_1 k}{m}\frac{\sin(kx-\omega t) - \sin(kx-kut)}{(\omega - ku)^2}
\]

Apparently, we were not clever enough, since the \(\sin(kx-\omega t)\)
factor does not cancel. To get a term of the form \(\sin(kx-kut)\),
which came from the added term in \(v_1\), we can add a term of the form
\(At\sin(kx-kut)\) to \(n_1\). This term obviously vanishes at \(t=0\),
and it will give the \(\sin(kx-kut)\) term when the operator on the
left-hand side of the equation of continuity operates on the \(t\)
factor. When the operator operates on the \(\sin(kx-kut)\) factor, it
yields zero. The coefficient \(A\) must be proportional to
\((\omega-ku)^{-1}\) in order to match the same factor in
\(\partial v_1/\partial x\). Thus we take

\[
\begin{aligned}
n_1 =& -n_u\frac{eE_1 k}{m}\frac{1}{(\omega-ku)^2} \\
&\times[\cos(kx-\omega t) - \cos(kx-kut) - (\omega - ku)t\sin(kx-kut)]
\end{aligned}
\]

This clearly vanishes at \(t=0\), and one can easily verify that it
satisfies the equation of continuity.

These expressions for \(v_1\) and \(n_1\) allow us now to calculate the
work done by the wave on each beam. The force acting on a unit volume of
each beam is

\[
F_u = -eE_q\sin(kx-\omega t)(n_u+n_1)
\]

and therefore its energy changes at the rate

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t} = F_u(u+v_1) = -eE_1\sin(kx-\omega t)(\underbrace{n_u u}_{1} +\underbrace{n_uv_1}_{2} + \underbrace{n_1 u}_{3} + \underbrace{n_1 v_1}_{4})
\]

We now take the spatial average over a wavelength. The first term
vanishes because \(n_u u\) is a constant. The fourth term can be
neglected because it is second order, but in any case it can be shown to
have zero average. The second and third terms can be evaluated with the
help of identities

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left< \sin(kx-\omega t)\cos(kx-kut) \right> &= -\frac{1}{2}\sin(\omega t-kut) \\
\left< \sin(kx-\omega t)\sin(kx-kut) \right> &= \frac{1}{2}\cos(\omega t-kut)
\end{aligned}
\]

The result is then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left< \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\right>_u = \frac{e^2E_1^2}{2m}n_u\Big[ &\frac{\sin(\omega t - kut)}{\omega - ku} \\
& + ku\frac{\sin(\omega t-kut) - (\omega-ku)t\cos(\omega t-kut)}{(\omega-ku)^2} \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

The total work done on the particles is found by summing over all the
beams:

\[
\sum_u \left< \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\right>_u = \int \frac{f_0(u)}{n_u}\left< \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\right>_u dy = n_0\int\frac{\hat{f}_0(u)}{n_u}\left< \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\right>_u du
\]

Inserting the expression of
\(\left< \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\right>_u\) and using the
definition of \(\omega_p\), we then find for the rate of change of
kinetic energy

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left< \frac{dW_k}{\mathrm{d}t}\right> =& \frac{\epsilon_0 E_1^2}{2}\omega_p^2 \Big[ \int\hat{f}_0(u)\frac{\sin(\omega t - kut)}{\omega - ku} du \\
& + \int\hat{f}_0(u) \frac{\sin(\omega t-kut) - (\omega-ku)t\cos(\omega t-kut)}{(\omega-ku)^2}ku du \Big] \\
=& \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 E_1^2 \omega_p^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\hat{f}_0(u) du \Big\{ \frac{\sin(\omega t - kut)}{\omega - ku} + u\frac{d}{du}\Big[\frac{\sin(\omega t - kut)}{\omega - ku} \Big] \Big\} \\
=& \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 E_1^2 \omega_p^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\hat{f}_0(u) du \frac{d}{du}\Big[u\frac{\sin(\omega t - kut)}{\omega - ku} \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

This is to be set equal to the rate of loss of wave energy density
\(W_w\). The wave energy consists of two parts. The first part is the
energy density of the electrostatic field:

\[
\left< W_E \right> = \frac{\epsilon \left< E^2 \right>}{2} = \frac{\epsilon E_1^2}{4}
\]

The second part is the kinetic energy of oscillation of the particles.
If we again divide the plasma up into beams, the energy per beam is
given as before

\[
\left<\Delta W_k \right>_u = \frac{1}{4}\frac{n_u}{m} \frac{e^2E_1^2}{(\omega - ku)^2}\Big[ 1+\frac{2ku}{\omega-ku} \Big]
\]

In deriving this result, we did not use the correct initial conditions,
which are important for the resonant particles; however, the latter
contribute very little to the total energy of the wave. Summing over the
beams, we have

\[
\left<\Delta W_k \right> = \frac{1}{4}\frac{e^2E_1^2}{m}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{f_0(u)}{(\omega - ku)^2}\Big[ 1+\frac{2ku}{\omega-ku} \Big] du
\]

The second term in the brackets can be neglected in the limit
\(\omega/k \gg v_{th}\), which we shall take in order to compare with
our previous results. (???) The dispersion relation is found by
Poisson's equation:

\[
k\epsilon_0 E_1\cos(kx-\omega t) = -e\sum_u n_1
\]

Using the expression for \(n_1\) in the previous section with the wrong
initial conditions, we have

\[
1 = \frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0 m}\sum_u \frac{n_u}{(\omega-ku)^2} = \frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0 m}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{f_0(u)du}{(\omega-ku)^2}
\]

Comparing this with the expression of \(\left< \Delta W_k \right>\), we
find

\[
\left< \Delta W_k \right> = \frac{1}{4}\frac{e^2E_1^2}{m}\frac{\epsilon_0 m}{e^2} = \frac{\epsilon_0 E_1^2}{4} = \left< W_E \right>
\]

Thus

\[
W_w = \frac{\epsilon E_1^2}{2}
\]

The rate of change of wave energy density \(W_w\) is given by
\(-\left< \frac{dW_k}{\mathrm{d}t} \right>\):

\[
\frac{dW_w}{\mathrm{d}t} = -W_w \omega_p^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\hat{f}_0(u) du \frac{d}{du}\Big[u\frac{\sin(\omega t - kut)}{\omega - ku} \Big]
\]

Integration by parts gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dW_w}{\mathrm{d}t} =& W_w \omega_p^2 \Big\{ \Big[ u\hat{f}_0(u)\frac{\sin(\omega-ku)t}{\omega - ku} \Big]_{-\infty}^{\infty} \\
&- \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u\frac{d\hat{f}_0}{du}\frac{\sin(\omega-ku)t}{\omega-ku} du \Big\}
\end{aligned}
\]

The integrated part vanishes for well-behaved functions
\(\hat{f}_0(u)\), and we have

\[
\frac{dW_w}{\mathrm{d}t} = W_w\frac{\omega}{k}\omega_p^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d\hat{f}_0}{du}\Big[\frac{\sin(\omega-ku)t}{\omega-ku}\Big] du
\]

where \(u\) has been set equal to \(\omega/k\) (a constant), since only
velociies very close to this will contirbute to the integral. In fact,
for sufficiently large \(t\), the square bracket can be approximated by
a \(\delta\)-function:

\[
\delta\Big( u - \frac{\omega}{k}\Big) = \frac{k}{\pi}\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\Big[ \frac{\sin(\omega-ku) t}{\omega-ku} \Big]
\]

(The original form is
\(\delta(x) = \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin(x/\epsilon)}{\pi x}\),
where the function on the right is called sinc.)

Thus

\[
\frac{dW_w}{\mathrm{d}t} = W_w\frac{\omega}{k}\omega_p^2 \frac{\pi}{k}\frac{\omega}{k}\hat{f}_0\Big(\frac{\omega}{k}\Big) = W_w \pi \omega\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\hat{f}_0^\prime\Big(\frac{\omega}{k}\Big)
\]

Since \(\Im(\omega)\) is the growth rate of \(E_1\), and \(W_w\) is
proportional to \(E_1^2\), we must have

\[
\frac{dW_w}{\mathrm{d}t} = 2\Im(\omega)W_w
\]

Hence

\[
\Im(\omega) = \frac{\pi}{2}\omega\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2}\hat{f}_0^\prime\Big(\frac{\omega}{k}\Big)
\]

in agreement with the previous result for \(\omega=\omega_p\).

\hypertarget{the-resonant-particles}{%
\subsection{The Resonant Particles}\label{the-resonant-particles}}

We are now in a position to see precisely which are the resonant
particles that contribute to linear Landau damping. Fig.7-25(Sinc
function, ADD IT!) gives a plot of the factor multiplying
\(\hat{f}_0^\prime(u)\) in the integrand. We see that the largest
contribution comes from particles with \(|\omega - ku| < \pi/t\), or
\(|v-v_\phi| < \pi/k = \lambda/2\); i.e.~those particles in the initial
distribution that have not yet traveled a half-wavelength relative to
the wave. The width of the central peak narrows with time, as expected.
The subsidiary peaks in the ``diffraction pattern'' of Fig.7-25 come
form particles that have traveled into neighboring half-wavelengths of
the wave potential. These particles rapidly become spread out in phase,
so that they contribute little on the average; the initial distribution
is forgotten. Note that the width of the central peak is independent of
the initial amplitude of the wave; hence, the resonant particles may
include both trapped and untrapped particles. This phenomenon is
unrelated to particle trapping.

\hypertarget{two-paradoxes-resolved}{%
\subsection{Two Paradoxes Resolved}\label{two-paradoxes-resolved}}

Fig.7-25 shows that the integrand sinc function is an even function of
\(\omega-ku\), so that particles going both faster than the wave and
slower than the wave add to Landau damping. This is the physical picture
we found in Fig.7-24. On the other hand, the slope of the curve of
Fig.7-25, which represents the factor in the integrand of one previous
equation (WE NEED NUMBERING!), is an odd function of \(\omega-ku\); and
one would infer from this that particles traveling faster than the wave
give energy to it, while those traveling slower than the wave take
energy from it. The two descriptions differ by an integration by parts.
Both descriptions are correct; which is to be chosen depends on whether
one wishes to have \(\hat{f}_0(u)\) or \(\hat{f}_0(u)^\prime\) in the
integrand.

A second paradox concerns the question of Galilean invariance. If we
take the view that damping requires there be fewer particles traveling
faster than the wave than slower, there is no problem as long as one is
in the frame in which the plasma is at rest. However, if one goes into
another frame moving with a velocity \(V\), there would appear to be
more particles moving faster than the wave than slower, and one would
expect the wave to grow instead of decay. This paradox is removed by
reinserting the second term in Eq.(???) \(\frac{2ku}{\omega-ku}\) which
we neglected. As shown in the previous section, this term can make
\(\left< \Delta W_k \right>\) negative. Indeed, in the moving frame, the
second term is not negligible, \(\left< \Delta W_k \right>\) is
negative, and the wave appears to have negative energy (that is, there
is more energy in the quiescent, drifting Maxwellian distribution than
in the presence of an oscillation). The wave ``grows'', but adding
energy to a negative energy wave makes its amplitude decrease.

\hypertarget{bgk-and-van-kampen-modes}{%
\section{BGK and Van Kampen Modes}\label{bgk-and-van-kampen-modes}}

We have seen that Landau damping is directly connected to the
requirement that \(f_0(v)\) be initially uniform in space. (It tends to
make negative slopes to zero.) On the other hand, one can generate
undamped electron waves if \(f(v, t=0)\) is mode to be constant along
the particle trajectories initially. (???) It is easy to from Fig.7-24
that the particles will neither gain nor lose energy, on the average, if
the plasma is initially prepared so that the density is constant along
each trajectory. Such a wave is called a BGK mode, since it was I. B.
Bernstein, J. M. Greene, and M. D. Kruskal who first showed that
undamped waves of arbitrary \(\omega\), \(k\), amplitude, and waveform
were possible. The crucial parameter to adjust in tailoring \(f(v,t=0)\)
to form a BGK mode is the relative number of trapped and untrappped
particles. If we take the small-amplitude limit of a BGK mode, we obtain
what is called a Van Kampen mode. In this limit, only the particles with
\(v=v_\phi\) are trapped. We can change the number of trapped particles
by adding to \(f(v,t=0)\) a term proportional to \(\delta(v-v_\phi)\).
Examination of Fig.7-24 will show that adding particles along the line
\(v=v_\phi\) will not cause damping --- at a later time, there are just
as many particles gaining energy as losing energy. In fact, by choosing
distributions with \(\delta\)-functions at other values of \(v_\phi\),
one can generate undamped Van Kampen modes of arbitrary \(v_\phi\). Such
sungular initial conditions are, however, not physical. To get a
smoothly varying \(f(v,t=0)\), one must sum over Van Kampen modes with a
distribution of \(v_\phi s\). Although each mode is undamped, the total
perturbation will show Landau damping because the various modes get out
of phase with one another. (???)

\hypertarget{ion-landau-damping}{%
\section{Ion Landau Damping}\label{ion-landau-damping}}

Electrons are not the only resonant particles. If a wave has a slow
enough phase velocity to match the thermal velocity of ions, ion Landau
damping can occur. The ion acoustic wave, for instance, is greatly
affected by Landau damping. Recall from the fluid theory that the
dispersion relation for ion waves is

\[
\frac{\omega}{k} = v_s = \Big( \frac{k_BT_e + \gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i} \Big)^{1/2}
\]

If \(T_e \le T_i\), the phase velocity lies in the region where
\(f_{0i}(v)\) has a negative slope, as shown in Fig.7-30(A)(ADD IT!!!).
Consequently, ion waves are heavily Landau-damped if \(T_e \le T_i\).
Ion waves are observable only if \(T_e \gg T_i\)(Fig.7-30(B)), so that
the phase velocity lies far in the tail of the ion velocity
distribution. A clever way to introduce Landau damping in a controlled
manner was employed by Alexeff, Jones, and Montgomery. A weakly damped
ion wave was created in a heavy-ion plasma (such as xenon) with
\(T_e \gg T_i\). A small amount of a light atom (helium) was then added.
Since the helium had about the temperature as the xenon but had much
smaller mass, its distribution function was much broader, as shown by
the dashed curve in Fig.7-30(B). The resonant helium ions then caused
the wave to damp.

\hypertarget{the-plasma-dispersion-function}{%
\subsection{The Plasma Dispersion
Function}\label{the-plasma-dispersion-function}}

To introduce some of the standard terminlogy of kinetic theory, we now
calculate the ion Landau damping of ion acoustic waves in the absence of
magnetic fields. Ions and electrons follow the Vlasov equation and have
perturbations of the form \(f_1\propto\exp(ikx-i\omega t)\) indicating
plane waves propagating in the x direction. The solution for \(f_1\) is
given by the linearized momentum equation with appropriate
modifications:

\[
f_{1j} = -\frac{iq_jE}{m_j}\frac{\partial f_{oj}/\partial v_j}{\omega-kv_j}
\]

where \(E\) and \(v_j\) stand for \(E_x, v_{xj}\); and the \(j\)th
species has charge \(q_j\), mass \(m_j\), and particle velocity \(v_j\).
The density perturbation of the \(j\)th species is given by

\[
n_{1j} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{1j}(v_j)dv_j = -\frac{iq_jE}{m_j}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial f_{oj}/\partial v_j}{\omega-kv_j}dv_j
\]

Let the equilibrium distributions \(f_{0j}\) be one-dimensional
Maxwellians:

\[
f_{0j} = \frac{n_{0j}}{v_{thj}\pi^{1/2}}e^{-v_j^2/v_{th}^2},\quad v_{thj}\equiv (2k_B T_j/m_j)^{1/2}
\]

Introducing the dummy integration variable \(s = v_j/v_{thj}\), we can
write \(n_{1j}\) as

\[
n_{1j} = \frac{iq_j E n_{0j}}{km_j v_{thj}^2}\frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(d/ds)(e^{-s^2})}{s -\zeta_j}ds
\]

where

\[
\zeta\equiv \omega/k v_{thj}
\]

We now define the \emph{plasma dispersion function} \(Z(\zeta)\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:plasma_dispersion_function}{}{
Z(\zeta) = \frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-s^2}}{s -\zeta}ds\quad \Im(\zeta)>0
}\label{eq:plasma_dispersion_function}\end{equation}

(Why positive imaginary part???)This is a contour integral, as explained
in previous sections, and analytic continuation to the lower half plane
must be used if \(\Im(\zeta)<0\). \(Z(\zeta)\) is a complex function of
a complex argument (since \(\omega\) or \(k\) usually has an imaginary
part). In cases where \(Z(\zeta)\) cannot be approximated by an
asymptotic formula, one can do it numerically.

To express \(n_{1j}\) in terms of \(Z(\zeta)\), we take the derivative
with respect to \(\zeta\):

\[
Z^\prime(\zeta) = \frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-s^2}}{(s -\zeta)^2}ds
\]

Integration by parts yields

\[
Z^\prime(\zeta) = \frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}}\Big[ \frac{-e^{-s^2}}{s-\zeta} \Big]_{-\infty}^{\infty} + \frac{1} {\pi^{1/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(d/ds)(e^{-s^2})}{s -\zeta}ds
\]

The first term vanishes, as it must for any well-behaved distribution
function. Now we have

\[
n_{1j} = \frac{iq_j E n_{0j}}{km_j v_{thj}^2}Z^\prime(\zeta_j)
\]

Poisson's equation is

\[
\epsilon\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = ik\epsilon_0E = \sum_j q_j n_{1j}
\]

Combining the last two equations, separating out the electron term
explicitly, and defining

\[
\Omega_{pj}\equiv(n_{oj}Z_j^2 e^2/\epsilon_0 m_j)^{1/2}
\]

We obtain the dispersion relation

\[
k^2 = \frac{\omega_p^2}{v_{the}^2}Z^\prime(\zeta_e) + \sum_j\frac{\Omega_{pj}^2}{v_{thj}^2}Z^\prime(\zeta_j)
\]

Electron plasma waves can be obtained by setting \(\Omega_{pj}=0\)
(infinitely massive ions). Defining

\[
k_D^2 = 2\omega_p^2/v_{the}^2 = \lambda_D^{-2}
\]

we then obtain

\[
k/k_D^2 = \frac{1}{2}Z^\prime(\zeta_e)
\]

which is the same as Equation~\ref{eq:dispersion_0th} when \(f_{0e}\) is
Maxwellian.

\hypertarget{ion-waves-and-their-damping}{%
\subsection{Ion Waves and Their
Damping}\label{ion-waves-and-their-damping}}

To obtain ion waves, go back to the plasma dispersion relation and use
the fact that their phase velocity \(\omega/k\) is much smaller than
\(v_{the}\); hence \(\zeta_e\) is small, and we can expand
\(Z(\zeta_e)\) in a power series:

\[
Z(\zeta_e) = i\sqrt{\pi}e^{-\zeta_e^2} - 2\zeta_e(1-\frac{2}{3}\zeta_e^2 + ...)
\]

The imaginary term comes from the residue at a pole lying near the real
\(s\) axis and represents electron Landau damping. For
\(\zeta_e \ll 1\), the derivative of the above gives

\[
Z^\prime(\zeta_e) = -2i\sqrt{\pi}\zeta_e e^{-\zeta_e^2} - 2 + ... \simeq -2
\]

Electron Landau damping can usually be neglected in ion waves because
the slope of \(f_e(v)\) is small near its peak. Replacing
\(Z^\prime(\zeta_e)\) by -2 in the dispersion relation gives

\[
\lambda_D\sum_j \frac{\Omega_{pj}^2}{v_{thj}^2}Z^\prime(\zeta_j) = 1+k^2\lambda_D^2 \simeq 1
\]

The term \(k^2\lambda_D^2\) represents the deviation from
quasineutrality. (\(1/k\sim L,k^2\lambda_D^2 \sim\lambda_D^2/L^2\ll 1\)
where \(L\) is the system length scale.)

We now specialize tothe case of a single ion species. Since
\(n_{0e}=Z_in_{0i}\), the coefficient in the equation above is

\[
\lambda_D\frac{\Omega_{p}^2}{v_{thi}^2}=\frac{\epsilon k_B T_e}{n_{0e}e^2}\frac{n_{0i}Z^2e^2}{\epsilon m_i}\frac{m_i}{2k_B T_i} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{ZT_e}{T_i}
\]

For \(k_2\lambda_D^2\ll 1\), the dispersion relation becomes

\[
Z^\prime(\frac{\omega}{kv_{thi}}) = \frac{2T_i}{ZT_e}
\]

Solving this equation is a nontrivial problem. Suppose we take real
\(k\) and complex \(\omega\) to study damping in time. Then the real and
imaginary parts of \(\omega\) must be adjusted so that
\(\Im(Z^\prime)=0\) and \(\Re(Z^\prime) = 2T_i/ZT_e\). There are in
general many possible roots \(\omega\) that satisfy this, all of them
having \(\Im(\omega)<0\). The least damped, dominant root is the one
having the smallest \(|\Im(\omega)|\). Damping in space is usually
treated by taking \(\omega\) real and \(k\) complex. Again we get a
series of roots \(k\) with \(\Im(k)>0\), representing spatial damping.
However, the dominant root does not correspond to the same value of
\(\zeta_i\) as in the complex \(\omega\) case. It turns out that the
spatial problem has to be treated with special attention to the
excitation mechanism at the boundaries and with more careful treatment
of the electron term \(Z^\prime(\zeta_e)\).

To obtain an analytic result, we consider the limit \(\zeta_i \gg 1\),
corresponding to large temperature ratio \(\theta\equiv ZT_e/T_i\).
(???) The asymptotic expression for \(Z^\prime(\zeta_i)\) is

\[
Z^\prime(\zeta_i) = -2i\sqrt{\pi}\zeta_i e^{-\zeta_i^2} + \zeta_i^{-2} + \frac{3}{2}\zeta_i^{-4} + ...
\]

(I think this can be found from the plasma handbook; it can also be
found
\href{https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node87.html}{here})
If the damping is small, we cna neglect the Landau term in the first
approximation. The equation becomes

\[
\frac{1}{\zeta_i^2}\Big( 1+\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{\zeta_i^2} \Big) = \frac{2}{\theta}
\]

Since \(\theta\) is assumed large, \(\zeta_i^2\) is large; and we can
approximate \(\zeta_i^2\) by \(\theta/2\) in the second term. Thus

\[
\frac{1}{\zeta_i^2}\Big( 1+\frac{3}{\theta} \Big) = \frac{2}{\theta},\quad \zeta_i^2 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

or

\[
\frac{\omega^2}{k^2} = \frac{2k_B T_i}{m_i}\Big( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{ZT_e}{2T_i} \Big) = \frac{Zk_B T_e + 3k_B T_i}{m_i}
\]

This is the ion wave dispersion relation with \(\gamma_i=3\),
generalized to arbitrary \(Z\).

We now substitue the above approximations back into the dispersion
relation retaining the Landau term:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\zeta_i^2}\Big( 1+\frac{3}{\theta} \Big) - 2i\sqrt{\pi}\zeta_i e^{-\zeta_i^2} = \frac{2}{\theta} \\
\frac{1}{\zeta_i^2}\Big( 1+\frac{3}{\theta} \Big) = \frac{2}{\theta}(1+i\sqrt{\pi}\theta\zeta_i e^{-\zeta_i^2}) \\
\zeta_i^2 = \Big(\frac{3+\theta}{2}\Big)^{1/2}(1+i\sqrt{\pi}\theta\zeta_i e^{-\zeta_i^2})^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]

Expanding the square root, we have

\[
\zeta_i \simeq \Big(\frac{3+\theta}{2}\Big)^{1/2}\Big(1-\frac{1}{2}i\sqrt{\pi}\theta\zeta_i e^{-\zeta_i^2}\Big)
\]

The approximate damping rate is found by using the above approximation
in the imaginary term:

\[
-\frac{\Im(\zeta_i)}{\Re(\zeta_i)} = \frac{\Im(\omega)}{\Re(\omega)} = \Big(\frac{\pi}{8} \Big)^{1/2}\theta (3+\theta)^{1/2} e^{-(3+\theta)/2}
\]

This asymptotic expression, accurate for large \(\theta\), shows an
exponential decrease in damping with increasing \(\theta\). When
\(\theta\) falls below 10, this expression becomes inacuurate, and the
damping must be computed from the original expression which employs the
Z-function. For the experimentally interesting region \(1<\theta<10\),
the following simple formula is ananalytic fit to the exact solution:

\[
-\Im(\omega)/\Re(\omega) = 1.1\theta^{7/4}\exp(-\theta^2)
\]

What happens when collisions are added to ion Landau damping?
Surprisingly little. Ion-electron collisions are weak because the ion
and electron fluids move almost in unison, creating little friction
between them. Ion-ion collisions (ion viscosity) can damp ion acoustic
waves, but we know that sound waves in air can propagate well in spite
of the dominance of collisions. Actually, collisions spoil the particle
resonances that cause Landau damping, and one finds that the total
damping is \emph{less} than the Landau damping unless the collision rate
is extremely large. In summary, ion Landau damping is almost always the
dominant process with ion waves, and this varies exponentially with the
ratio \(ZT_e/T_i\).

\hypertarget{kinetic-effects-in-a-magnetic-field}{%
\section{Kinetic Effects in a Magnetic
Field}\label{kinetic-effects-in-a-magnetic-field}}

When either the dc magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_0\) or the oscillating
magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_1\) is finite, the
\(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\) term in the Vlasov equation for a
collisionless plasma must be included. The linearized equation is then
replaced by

\[
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla f_1 +\frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)\cdot\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = -\frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_1)\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial \mathbf{v}}
\]

Resonant particles moving along \(\mathbf{B}_0\) still cause Landau
damping if \(\omega/k\simeq v_{th}\), but two new kinetic effects now
appera which are connected with the velocity component
\(\mathbf{v}_\perp\) perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}_0\). One of these is
cyclotron damping, which will be discussed later; the other is the
generation of cyclotron harmonics, leading to the possibility of the
oscillation commonly called Bernstein waves.

Harmonics of the cyclotron frequency are generated when the particles'
circular Larmor orbits are distorted by the wave fields \(\mathbf{E}_1\)
and \(\mathbf{B}_1\). These finite-\(r_L\) effects are neglected in
ordinary fluid theory but can be taken into account to order
\(k^2r_L^2\) by including the viscosity. A kinetic treatment can be
accurate even for \(k^2r_L^2 = \mathcal{O}(1)\). To understand how
harmonics aris, consider the motion of a particle in an electric field:

\[
\mathbf{E} = E_x e^{i(kx-\omega t)}\hat{\mathbf{x}}
\]

The equation of motion is

\[
\ddot{x} + \omega_c^2 x = \frac{1}{m}E_x e^{i(kx-\omega t)}
\]

If \(kr_L\) is not small, the exponent varies from one side of the orbit
to the other. We can approximate \(kx\) by substituting the undisturbed
orbit \(x=r_L\sin\omega_c t\)

\[
\ddot{x} + \omega_c^2 x = \frac{1}{m}E_x e^{i(kr_L\sin\omega_c t-\omega t)}
\]

The generating function for the Bessel function \(J_n(z)\) is

\[
e^{z(t-1/t)/2} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} t^n J_n(z)
\]

Letting \(z=kr_L\) and \(t = \exp(i\omega_c t)\), we obtain

\[
e^{ikr_L\sin\omega_c t} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n(kr_L) e^{in\omega_c t}
\]

\[
\ddot{x} + \omega_c^2 x = \frac{q}{m}E_x \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}J_n(kr_L) e^{i(\omega-n\omega_c) t}
\]

The following solution can be verified by direct substitution:

\[
x = \frac{q}{m}E_x \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{J_n(kr_L)e^{i(\omega-n\omega_c) t}}{\omega_c^2 - (\omega - n\omega_c)^2}
\]

This shows that the motion has frequency components differing from the
driving frequency by multiples of \(\omega_c\), and that the amplitudes
of these components are proportional to
\(J_n(kr_L)/[\omega_c^2 - (\omega - n\omega_c)^2]\). When the
denominator vanishes, the amplitude becomes large. This happens when
\(\omega-n\omega_c = \pm \omega_c\), or
\(\omega=(n\pm 1)\omega_c,\ n=0,\pm 1, \pm 2, ...\); that is, when the
field \(\mathbf{E}(x,t)\) resonates with any harmonic of \(\omega_c\).
In the fluid limit \(kr_L\rightarrow 0\), \(J_n(kr_L)\) can be
approximated by \((kr_L/2)^n/n!\), which approaches 0 for all \(n\)
except \(n=0\). For \(n=0\), the coefficient becomes
\((\omega_c^2-\omega^2)^{-1}\), which is the fluid result containing
only the fundamental cyclotron frequency.

\hypertarget{sec:HPDR}{%
\subsection{The Hot Plasma Dielectric Tensor}\label{sec:HPDR}}

After Fourier analysis of \(f_1(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t)\) in space and
time, the linearized Vlasov equation can be solved for a Maxwellian
distribution \(f_0(\mathbf{v})\), and the resulting expression
\(f_1(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v},\omega)\) can be used to calculate the
density and current of each species. The result is usually expressed in
the form of an equivalent dielectric tensor
\(\overleftrightarrow{\epsilon}\), such that the dispersion vector
\(\mathbf{D}=\overleftrightarrow{\epsilon}\cdot\mathbf{E}\) can be used
in the Maxwell's equations to calculate dispersion relations for various
waves. The algebra is horrendous and therefore omitted. We quote only a
restricted result valid for nonrelativistic plasmas with isotropic
pressure \(T_\perp = T_\parallel\) and no zero-order drifts
\(\mathbf{v}_{0j}\); these restrictions are easily removed, but he
general formulas are too cluttered for our purposes. We further assume
\(\mathbf{k} = k_x\hat{\mathbf{x}} + k_z\hat{\mathbf{z}}\), with
\(\hat{\mathbf{z}}\) being the direction of \(\mathbf{B}_0\); no
generality is lost by setting \(k_y\) equal to zero, since the plasma is
isotropic in the plane perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}_0\). The elements

\(\overleftrightarrow{\epsilon}_R = \overleftrightarrow{\epsilon}/\epsilon_0\)

\[

where \(Z(\zeta)\) is the plasma dispersion function, \(I_n(b)\) is the
\(n\)th order Bessel function of imaginary argument, and the other
symbols are defined by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\omega_{ps}^2 &= n_{0s} Z_s^2 e^2 / \epsilon_0 m_s \\

The first sum is over species \(s\), with the understanding that
\(\omega_p, b, \zeta_0\), and \(\zeta_n\) all depend on \(s\), and that
the \(\pm\) stands for the sign of the charge. The second sum is over
the harmonic number \(n\). The primes indicate differentiation with
respect to the argument.

As foreseen, there appera Bessel functions of finite-\(r_L\) parameter
\(b\). (The change from \(J_n(b)\) to \(I_n(b)\) occurs in the
integration over velocities.) The elements of
\(\overleftrightarrow{\epsilon}\) involving motion along
\(\hat{\mathbf{z}}\) contain \(Z^\prime(\zeta_n)\), which gives rise to
Landau damping when \(n=0\) and \(\omega/k_z\simeq v_{th}\). The
\(n\neq 0\) terms now make possible another collisionless damping
mechanism, cyclotron damping, which occurs when
\((\omega_c \pm n\omega_c)/k_z\simeq v_{th}\).

\hypertarget{bernstein-waves}{%
\subsection{Bernstein Waves}\label{bernstein-waves}}

Electrostatic waves propagating at right angles to \(\mathbf{B}_0\) at
harmonics of the cyclotron frequency are called Bernstein waves. The
dispersion relation can be found by using the dielectric elements give
in the previous section in Poisson's equation
\(\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{\epsilon}\cdot\mathbf{E}=0\). If we
assume electrostatic perturbations such that
\(\mathbf{E}_1=-\nabla\phi_0\), and consider waves of the form
\(\phi_1=\phi_1\exp i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)\), Poisson's
equation can be written

\[
k_x^2 \epsilon_{xx} + 2k_x k_z \epsilon_{xz} + k_z^2 \epsilon_{zz} = 0
\]

Note that we have chosen a coordinate system that has \(\mathbf{k}\)
lying in the x-z plane, so that \(k_y=0\). We next substitute for
\(\epsilon_{xx},\epsilon_{xz}\), and \(\epsilon_{zz}\) from the
dielectric tensor expression and express \(Z^\prime(\zeta_n)\) in terms
of \(Z(\zeta_n)\) with the identity

\[
Z^\prime(\zeta_n) = -2[1+\zeta Z(\zeta_n)]
\]

via integration by parts. The equation becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
k_x^2 + &k_z^2 + \sum_s\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}e^{-b}\zeta_0 \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} I_n(b) \\
&\times \big[ k_x^2\frac{n^2}{b}Z - 2\big(\frac{2}{b}\big)^{1/2}nk_xk_z(1+\zeta_n Z)-2k_z^2 \zeta_n(1+\zeta_n Z) \big] = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

The expression in the square brackets can be simplified in a few
algebraic steps to \(2k_z^2[\zeta_{-n} + \zeta_0^2 Z(\zeta_n)]\) by
using the definitions \(b = k_x^2 v_{th}^2/2\omega_c^2\) and
\(\zeta_n=(\omega+n\omega_c)/k_zv_{th}\). Further noticing that
\(2k_z^2 \omega_p^2 \zeta_0/\omega^2 = 2\omega_p^2/v_{th}^2\equiv k_D^2\)
for each species, we can write the equation as

\[
k_x^2 + k_z^2 + \sum_s k_D^2 e^{-b}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} I_n(b)[\zeta_{-n}/\zeta_0 + \zeta_0 Z(\zeta_n)] = 0
\]

The term \(\zeta_{-n}/\zeta_0=1-n\omega_c/\omega\). Since
\(I_n(b)=I_{-n}(b)\), the term \(I_n(b)n\omega_c/\omega\) sums to zero
when \(n\) goes from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\); hence,
\(\zeta_{-n}/\zeta_0\) can be replaced by 1. Defining
\(k^2 = k_x^2 + k_z^2\), we obtain the general dispersion relation for
Bernstein waves:

\[
1+ \sum_s\frac{k_D^2}{k_\perp^2}e^{-b}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} I_n(b)[1 + \zeta_0 Z(\zeta_n)] = 0
\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \emph{Electron Bernstein Waves}. Let us first consider high-frequency
  waves in which the ions do not move. These waves are not sensitive to
  small deviations from perpendicular propagation, and we may set
  \(k_z=0\), so that \(\zeta_n\rightarrow\infty\). There is, therefore,
  no cyclotron damping; the gaps in the spectrum that we shall find are
  not caused by such damping. For large \(\zeta_n\), we may replace
  \(Z(\zeta_n)\) by \(-1/\zeta_n\). (???) The \(n=0\) term in teh second
  sum of the above equation then cancels out, and we can divide the sum
  into two sums, as follows:
\end{enumerate}

\[
k_\perp^2 + \sum_s k_D^2 e^{-b}\Big[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n(b)(1 - \zeta_0 /\zeta_n) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} I_{-n}(b)(1 - \zeta_0 /\zeta_{-n})\Big] = 0
\]

or

\[
k_\perp^2 + \sum_s k_D^2 e^{-b}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n(b)\Big[ 2-\frac{\omega}{\omega+n\omega_c} - \frac{\omega}{\omega-n\omega_c} \Big] = 0
\]

The bracket collapses to a single term upon combining over a common
denominator:

\[
1 = \sum_s \frac{k_D^2}{k_\perp^2}e^{-b}\sum_{n=1}^\infty I_n(b)\frac{2n^2\omega_c^2}{\omega^2 - n^2\omega_c^2}
\]

Using the definitions of \(k_D\) and \(b\), one obtains the well-known
(NOT TO ME!!!) \(k_z=0\) dispersion relation

\[
1 = \sum_s \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega_c^2}\frac{2}{b}e^{-b}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{I_n(b)}{(\omega/n\omega_c)^2-1}
\]

We now specialize to the case of electron oscillations. Dropping the sum
over species, we obtain

\[
\frac{k_\perp^2}{k_D^2} = 2\omega_c^2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{-b}I_n(b)}{\omega^2 - n\omega_c^2}n^2 \equiv \alpha(\omega, b)
\]

\ldots{} (ADD fig.7-33!!!)

To obtain the fluid limit, we repalce \(I_n(b)\) by its small-\(b\)
value \((b/2)^n/n!\). Only the \(n=1\) term remains in the limit
\(b\rightarrow 0\), and we obtain

\[
1 = \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega_c^2}\frac{2}{b}\frac{b}{2}\Big( \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_c^2} - 1\Big)^{-1} = \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 - \omega_c^2}
\]

or \(\omega^2 = \omega_p^2 + \omega_c^2 = \omega_h^2\), which is the
upper hybrid oscillation. As \(k_\perp\rightarrow 0\), this frequency
must be one of the roots. If \(\omega_h\) falls between two high
harmonics of \(\omega_c\), the shape of the \(\omega-k\) curves changes
near \(\omega = \omega_h\) to allow this to occur. \ldots{}

  as we have seen earlier for lower hybrid oscillations, is that finite
  \(k_z\) allows electrons to flow along \(\mathbf{B}_0\) to cancel
  charge separations. Though the \(k_z=0\) case has already been treated

This chapter discusses plasma equilibrium and stability, or more

instabilities arise in plasmas.

Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in cosmological objects. General

  Why does this particular form remain?

Anything that reorganizes magnetic field is a transport phenomenon
therefore instabilities are of great interest. From hydrodynamic
instabilities to plasma instabilities, we need to realize the role of
magnetic field and kinetic physics in the instability process:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

    unstable; need \(\delta W>0 \forall\) types of disturbances).

\hypertarget{analogy-of-the-energy-principle}{%
\section{Analogy of the Energy
Principle}\label{analogy-of-the-energy-principle}}

First, let us have an intuitive inspection from the energy principle. In
classical mechanics, we learn that motion acts to lower the energy in
the system. For the simplest Rayleigh-Taylor instability between two
fluids with different density, we can easily decide if there is an
instability by checking the total potential energy change. In a
current-carrying plasma, similar motions can be developed. The energy
can be expressed as

\[
W=\frac{1}{2}LI^2
\]

where \(L\) is the inductance and \(I\) is the current. The magnetic
flux can be written as

\[
\Phi = LI
\]

so the energy can also be written as

\[
W=\frac{\Phi^2}{2L}
\]

The relation between magnetic flux and current is similar to charge and
voltage, \(Q=CV\), where \(C\) is the electric capacity. In a system
where magnetic flux \(\Phi\) is conserved (e.g.~ideal MHD), plasma
lowers its potential by increasing its inductance \(L\). Check

\section{Implication of Single Particle Motion on
Instabilities}\label{sec:particle_motion_instability}}

This section provides some qualitative understanding of instabilities in
plasma. Thinking of instabilities from the prospective of single
particle motion provides us the physical intuition of the causes and
development of instabilities from a very basic level.

\hypertarget{equilibrium-stability-of-a-plasma-from-drifts}{%
\subsection{Equilibrium stability of a plasma from
drifts}\label{equilibrium-stability-of-a-plasma-from-drifts}}

A key problem in nuclear fusion is to confine plasma. In the first
stage, we need current loops around a torus tube (ADD FIGURE!) to
provide a toroidal magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_t\) along the torus. Let
us take a look at a torus cut. (ADD FIGURE!) \(\nabla B_0\) is pointing
towards the inside. \(\mathbf{B}_0\) points outside the plane, so the
gradient-curvature drift will lead electrons upward and ions downward,
which in turn creates a E field pointing upwards.
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift then will lead both electrons and
ions towards the outer boundary. Eventually we will lose the plasma. One
way to fix this is to add \(\mathbf{J}_t\), an internal plasma current
in the toroidal direction to generate a poloidal \(\mathbf{B}_p\), so
that the magnetic field is stronger on the boundary than that at the
center. In this way the total magnetic field becomes a helix.

Consider the poloidal magnetic field generated by \(\mathbf{J}_t\). One
step further, our question is: will the plasma tube be stable under
infinitesimal perturbations to the ideal cylinder configuration? The
answer is no. Imagine a small perturbation shown as in
Figure~\ref{fig:kink_sausage} b. \(\nabla B\) points from weak B to
strong B regions. On the convex side, the gradient-curvature drift will
lead ions to the left and electrons to the right, which in turn
generates an electric field pointing left to right. Thereafter the
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift will further drag the plasma to the
convex region, and the whole system can never return to equilibrium.
This the current-carrying plasma instability is called \emph{kink
instability}. The situation described here is sometimes referred to as
\emph{linear kink instability}. The kink mode can carry currents.
Another similar mode is the \emph{sausage instability} as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:kink_sausage}. Also note that a sufficiently strong
\(B_z\) (not poloidal/toroidal component) can stabilize these
instabilities.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:kink_sausage}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/kink_sausage_modes.png}
\caption{Sausage and kink modes.}\label{fig:kink_sausage}
}
\end{figure}

Another famous instability is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In fluid
dynamics, Rayleigh-Taylor instability happens due to gravity. Here in
plasma physics, the role of gravity force is replaced by the
electromagnetic force. Imagine a situation where plasma are located at
\(z>0\) region, below which is a vacuum space. There is a B field
pointing outside the plane while \(\nabla B\) is pointing upwards
(\(B_{\text{up}}>B_{\text{down}}\)). Due to gradient drift on the
boundary, ions will move to the left while electrons will move to the
right, where a E field pointing left to right is created. Thus the
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift will lead plasma from upper region
to lower region, and eventually breaks the interface. (Actually I have
some questions for this figure: it seems to me that it is impossible to
decide which part of the interface is changing first?)

\hypertarget{sec:single_particle_instability}{%
\subsection{Stability of magnetic mirror in the scope of single particle
motion}\label{sec:single_particle_instability}}

We can deduce the stability of magnetic mirror by assuming a initial
small perturbation along the boundary. In the center cross-section cut,
first there is a centrifugal force pointing outward, which will cause
electrons drifting to one way and ions drifting to the other way. The
charge separation will generate an electric field. The
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift will then pull the plasma further
out if there's a ripple, which will lead to instability. Several names
describe the same thing: flute instability, R-T instability,
interchangeable instability, gravitational instability and so on. This
instability propagates at Alfvén speed.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:magnetic_mirror}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/magnetic_mirror.png}
\caption{Basic magnetic mirror
configuration.}\label{fig:magnetic_mirror}
}
\end{figure}

In general, we can define two configuration categories: the unstable
situation, where \(\mathbf{B}\) has a ``bad'' unfavorable curvature, and
the stable situation, where \(\mathbf{B}\) has a ``good'' favorable
curvature. This depends on whether or not the magnetic pressure in the
vacuum is stronger than that inside the plasma. In a basic magnetic
mirror, the plasma on the center boundaries are unstable, while those
around the coil curvature are stable.

A famous Russian scientist Ioffe introduced conducting bars around the
mirror to create an \emph{absolute minimum B-geometry}, where in any
point away from the center the B field is stronger. This indeed
supresses the R-T instability, but the whole system is, unfortunately,
still unstable due to micro-instabilities caused by lost cone
distribution. The inverted population (more high speed particles than
low speed ones) will lead to instabilities. Later scientists came up
with the idea of adding cold gas to modify the distribution, but the
cold gas injection procedure eventually kills the mirror configuration.

\hypertarget{stability-in-the-tokamak}{%
\subsection{Stability in the Tokamak}\label{stability-in-the-tokamak}}

In a classical Tokamak geometry, the poloidal and toroidal magnetic
field together created a spiral around the torus.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_T+\mathbf{B}_P \\
B=\sqrt{{B_T}^2+{B_P}^2}\approx B_T
\end{aligned}
\]

The field strength goes down as \(R\) increases, which implies that the
inner semi-tube is in good curvature and the outer semi-tube is in bad
curvature. By plotting mechanical potential=\(\mu B\) along the B-line
as a function of \(\theta\), we can see that there are bumps and
valleys. Particles with low \(v_\parallel\) are trapped, and those with
large \(v_\parallel\) are transit particles. Tokamak is an \emph{average
minimum B geometry}, because particles spend longer time on hills
(stable region) and less time in valleys (unstable region). This
geometry is not as robust as Ioffe bar magnetic mirror, since some
particles with small \(v_\parallel\) are always trapped in bad curvature
region.

\hypertarget{sec:RT}{%
\section{Rayleigh-Taylor Instability}\label{sec:RT}}

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is probably the most important MHD
instability. It is also called \emph{gravitational instability} ,
\emph{flute instability} or more generally, \emph{interchange
instability}. In ordinary hydrodynamics, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability
arises when one attempts to support a heavy fluid on top of a light
fluid: the interface becomes ``rippled'', allowing the heavy fluid to
fall through the light fluid. In plasmas, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability
can occur when a dense plasma is supported against gravity by the
pressure of a magnetic field.

The situation would not be of much interest or relevance in its own
right, since actual gravitational forces are rarely of much importance
in plasmas. However, in curved magnetic fields, the centrifugal force on
the plasma due to particle motion along the curved field-lines acts like
a ``gravitational'' force (Section~\ref{sec:gravity_field}). For this
reason, the analysis of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability provides useful
insight as to the stability properties of plasmas in curved magnetic
fields. Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities driven by actual field
curvature are the most virulent type of MHD instability in non-uniform
plasmas.

Here we use a 2-fluid model and a so-called ``diffuse boundary'' model
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2016introduction}{F. F. Chen, 2016}) to
describe it mathematically. Recall the structure of magnetic mirror: we
have curved magnetic field lines and high density plasma at the center.
From the discussion in Section~\ref{sec:single_particle_instability}, we
know that the central part of magnetic mirror is unstable for
Rayleigh-Taylor instability because of centrifugal force. Let us
simplify the scenario and study the problem in Cartesian coordinates.
The centrifugal force is irrelevant to particle charge and proportional
to particle mass, so both ions and electrons have the same acceleration
due to it. Let us replace the centrifugal force with gravity
\(\mathbf{g}\). In Figure~\ref{fig:RT_instability}, there are high
density plasma on top and low density plasma on the bottom, with a
distribution \(\partial n_o/\partial x<0\).

\hypertarget{fluid-diffuse-boundary-model}{%
\subsection{2-Fluid Diffuse Boundary
Model}\label{fluid-diffuse-boundary-model}}

This section is similar to Section 6.7 in
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen2016introduction}{F. F. Chen, 2016}).

The continuity and momentum equations are:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial n_j}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(n_j \mathbf{v_j})&=0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{v_j}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v_j}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v_j}&=\frac{q_j}{m_j}\big( \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v_j}\times\mathbf{B} \big)-\frac{\nabla P_j}{n_j m_j} + \mathbf{g}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(j=e^-, i^+\) for electrons and ions.

Assume an one-dimensional case

\[
\begin{aligned}
T_e = T_i = 0 \Rightarrow P_e=n_ek_BT_e = 0,\ P_i = n_ik_BT_i = 0 \\
n_0 = n_0(x), \frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x}<0\ (\textrm{nonuniform plasma}) \\
\mathbf{g}=g\hat{x}, g=\textrm{const.}>0 \\
\mathbf{B}_0=B_0\hat{z},\ B_0=\textrm{const.},\ \mathbf{E}_0=0\ (\textrm{no gradient/curvature drift})
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that there is no diamagnetic current if \(P_e=P_i=0\) (no electric
field so no current along \(\mathbf{B}_0\) ?):

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\mathbf{J}_{de}\times\mathbf{B}_0=-\nabla P_e=0 \\
&\mathbf{J}_{di}\times\mathbf{B}_0=-\nabla P_i=0 \\
\Rightarrow & \mathbf{J}_{de}=\mathbf{J}_{di}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Instability arises when an equilibrium state is violated. What is the
force that balances the gravity? It turns out to be the Lorentz force
\(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\) term: the separation of electrons and
ions creates currents, and currents lead to force.

ADD FIGURE!

In equilibrium, \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}=0\),
\(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big[ n_{0j}(x)v_{0j} \big]=0,\)
\(v_{0j}=\text{const.}\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial{n_{oj}}}{{\partial t}}+\nabla\cdot(n_{oj}\mathbf{v}_{oj})=0 \\
&\frac{q_j}{m_j}\mathbf{v}_j\times\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{g}=0 \\
\Rightarrow &
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{v}_i=\frac{gm_i}{q_iB_0}(-\hat{y})=-\frac{g}{\Omega_i}\hat{y}=-\hat{y}v_{0i} \\
\mathbf{v}_e=\frac{gm_e}{q_eB_0}(\hat{y})=\frac{g}{\Omega_e}\hat{y}=\hat{y}v_{0e}\approx 0 (v_{0e}\ll v_{0i})
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\Omega_i,\ \Omega_e\) are the gyro-frequency for ions and
electrons respectively.

Now, we introduce an electrostatic perturbation on this equilibrium
state (\(\mathbf{B}_1(\mathbf{x},t)=0\),
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_1=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}_1}{\partial t}=i\omega\mathbf{B}_1=0\),
\(\mathbf{E}_1\) can be written as a gradient of a scalar potential)

\[
\mathbf{E}_1(\mathbf{x},t)=-\nabla\Phi_1 = -\nabla\big[ \phi_1(x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \big]
\]

In addition, we adopt the so-called ``local approximation'', i.e.~we
assume \(\partial \phi_1/\partial x=0\),
\(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\big[ E_1,\mathbf{v}_1,n_1 \big]=0\). This
is a very drastic assumption that greatly simplifies the problem but
cannot be justified. This assumption is commonly used in many textbooks,
both explicitly and implicitly (e.g.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan, 2008}) used this
to treat universal instability. Remember in solving the Vlasov
equations, we integrate along the unperturbed orbits, which also
requires this assumption.)

In this case,

\[
\mathbf{E}_1=0\hat{x}+E_{1y}\hat{y}=\hat{y}\widetilde{E}_{1y}e^{ik_y y-i\omega t}
\]

where \(\widetilde{E}_{1y}=-i k_y \phi_1\) is a constant.

Linearization:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(n_0+n_1) +\nabla\cdot\big[ (n_0+n_1)(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1) \big]&=0 \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1)+(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1)\cdot\nabla(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1)&=\frac{q}{m}\big[ \mathbf{E}_0+\mathbf{E}_1+(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1)\times(\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{B}_1)\big]+\mathbf{g}
\end{aligned}
\]

Getting rid of the equilibrium and high-order terms, we have (Notice
that \(\mathbf{g}\) does not even appear here! In MHD, it does, in a
very explicit way.)

\[
\begin{aligned}
i(k_yv_{0y}-\omega)n_1=-n_0 ik_y v_{1y} - v_{1x}\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{v}_1=i(k_yv_{0y}-\omega)\mathbf{v}_1=\frac{q}{m}\big( \mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{v}_1\times\mathbf{B}_0 \big)
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, from the linearized momentum equation, we can get the x and y
components of perturbed velocity; intuitively, you can guess the
expression:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&v_{1,ix}=\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0},\ v_{1,ex}=\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0}\\
&v_{1,iy}=\frac{1}{\Omega_i}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big(\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0} \Big)=\frac{i(k_yv_{0i}-\omega)}{\Omega_i}\Big( \frac{E_{1y}}{B_0}\Big),\ v_{1,ey}=\frac{1}{\Omega_e}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big(\frac{E_{1y}}{B_0} \Big)\approx0
\end{aligned}
\]

where in the x direction, it is the \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)
drift, and in the y direction, it is the polarization drift.

From the linearized continuity equation

\[
\begin{aligned}
i(k_y v_{0,yi}-\omega)n_{1i} &= -n_0 ik_y v_{1,yi} - v_{1,xi}\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x} \\
-i\omega n_{1e} &= - v_{1,xe}\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then we can get \(n_{1e}=n_{1e}(E_{1y}),\ n_{1i}=n_{1i}(E_{1y})\).
Setting \(n_{1e}=n_{1i}\), we have the dispersion relation

\[
\omega(\omega-k_y v_{0i})=g\frac{1}{n_0}\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x}
\]

When \(k_y\rightarrow0\),

\[
\omega^2=g\frac{1}{n_0}\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x}<0 \Rightarrow\ \text{instability!}
\]

Let's think about this 2-fluid approach for a while. Apparently, we
cannot treat a sharp boundary, namely
\(\frac{\partial n_0}{\partial x}=\delta(x)\), with exactly the same
equations. However, it's quite a surprise that MHD approach can easily
do that, as we will see in the next section.

\hypertarget{single-fluid-mhd-method}{%
\subsection{Single fluid MHD method}\label{single-fluid-mhd-method}}

In equilibrium,
\(\mathbf{g}=\hat{x}g,\ \mathbf{B}_0=\hat{z}B_0(x),\ \mathbf{U}_0=0,\ \mathbf{E}_0=0,\ \rho_0(x),\ p_0(x)\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho_0 \mathbf{U}_0)=0 \\
0=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\Big[ -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}({B_0}^2)\Big] -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}p_0(x)+\rho_0(x)g
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that there's a difference between cases where different pressure is
dominant. For example, in z-pinch the magnetic pressure is dominant,
while in a laser pulse, the thermal pressure is usually dominant.

Assume perturbations of the form

\[
\begin{aligned}
p_1(\mathbf{x},t) &= p_1(x) e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \\
\rho_1(\mathbf{x},t) &= \rho_1(x) e^{i k_y y-i\omega t} \\
\mathbf{U}_1 &=\frac{\partial \pmb{\xi}_1}{\partial t}=-i\omega\pmb{\xi}_1
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\pmb{\xi}_1\) is the displacement.

We can calculate each linear term:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\big[(\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{B}_1)\cdot\nabla \big](\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{B}_1) \approx (\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}_1 + (\mathbf{B}_1\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}_0 = \big( B_0(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\big)\mathbf{B}_1 \\
B^2 = (\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{B}_1)\cdot(\mathbf{B}_1+\mathbf{B}_1)\approx 2\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1 \\
\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{U}_0+\mathbf{U}_1 = \mathbf{U}_1
\end{aligned}
\]

The tension term has no x or y component, so we can just ignore it. Then
the linearized momentum equation can be written as

\[
\rho_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}_1}{\partial t}=\rho_0\frac{\partial^2\pmb{\xi}_1}{\partial t^2}=-\nabla\Big( \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}\Big) - \nabla p_1 +\rho_1\mathbf{g}
\]

which can be separated into two scalar equations

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\rho_0 \omega^2 \xi_{1x} &= -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big( \frac{\mathbf{B}_1\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}+p_1 \Big) +\rho_1 g \\
-\rho_0 \omega^2 \xi_{1y} &= -ik_y\Big( \frac{\mathbf{B}_1\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{\mu_0}+p_1\Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

Assume incompressibility

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=0\Rightarrow \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_1=0,\ \nabla\cdot\pmb{\xi}_1=\frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x}+ik_y \xi_{1y}=0
\]

The linearized continuity equation
(Section~\ref{sec:es_wave_magnetized}) yields

\[
\rho_1=-\nabla\cdot(\rho_0\pmb{\xi}_1)=\xi_{1x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\rho_0
\]

Combining the last four equations, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RT_MHD_linear}{}{
-\rho_0\omega^2 \xi_{1x} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big[ \rho_0\omega^2 \frac{1}{{k_y}^2}\frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x}\Big] - g\xi_{1x}\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial x}
}\label{eq:RT_MHD_linear}\end{equation}

This is the governing equation for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,
which is the same as Eq.(10.15) in
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan, 2008}). Note
that here we have no assumption on the x-dependence; if we simply use
the local approximation as before, this immediately gives you the
identical result.

To treat the sharp boundary problem, we assume

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho_0= \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
\textrm{const.} & \text{if } x<0 \\
0 & \text{if } x>0
\end{array} \right.
\end{aligned}
\]

Then for \(x<0\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^2 \xi_{1x}}{\partial x^2} -{k_y}^2 \xi_{1x} = 0 \\
\Rightarrow\ \xi_{1x}=Ae^{k_y x} + Be^{-k_y x}
\end{aligned}
\]

and for \(x>0\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^2 \xi_{1x}}{\partial x^2} -{k_y}^2 \xi_{1x} = 0 \\
\Rightarrow\ \xi_{1x}=Ce^{k_y x} + De^{-k_y x}
\end{aligned}
\]

The coefficient \(B\) and \(C\) must be zero because of infinite field
requirement. Due to continuity at \(x=0\), we set

\[
A = D = \xi_0
\]

The density profile obeys

\[
\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial x}=-\rho_0\delta(x)
\]

Integrating the governing Equation~\ref{eq:RT_MHD_linear} from \(x=0^-\)
to \(x=0^+\) yields

\[
\begin{aligned}
&-\frac{\rho_0 \omega^2}{{k_y}^2}\frac{\xi_{1x}}{\partial x}\bigg|_{x=0^-}^{x=0^+} - g\xi_{1x}(-\rho_0)=0 \\
\Rightarrow &\omega^2=k_y g
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore the growth rate is \(\gamma=\Im(\omega)=\sqrt{k_y g}\). You
may realize that \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0=0\) here, so this
magnetic stablizing term vanishes in the dispersion relation.

\hypertarget{fluid-sharp-boundary-model}{%
\subsection{2-fluid sharp boundary
model}\label{fluid-sharp-boundary-model}}

Now let's go back and see if we can treat the sharp boundary problem
with 2-fluid model. This is actually not easy: it is first solved by
S.Chandraserkhar in the view of particle orbit theory. I believe there
is a more `modern' way of doing exactly the same thing, but here I just
list the original derivation.

We consider a plasma at uniform temperature lying above a horizontal
plane in a uniform gravitational field directed vertically downwards.
There is a horizontal magnetic field in x direction uniform in each half
volumn with a jump in field strength produced by a uniform horizontal
current sheet at the boundary plane \(z=0\). The gravitational force is
balanced by a pressure gradient in the plasma and by the jump in the
magnetic pressure at \(z=0\).

We now suppose the boundary of the plasam at \(z=0\) to be rippled by a
sinusoidal disturbance as shown in fig:RT\_perturb. We may write for the
displacement of the interface (ADD FIGURE!)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RT_displacement_z}{}{
\Delta z = a \sin ky
}\label{eq:RT_displacement_z}\end{equation}

where \(a\), the amplitude of the disturbance, is considered small and
\(k(=2\pi/\lambda)\) is the wave number of the disturbance in the
y-direction. The drift resulting from gravity is given by

\[
\mathbf{V}_g = \frac{m}{q}\frac{\mathbf{g}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]

Since the magnetic field is in the x-direction, the electrons will drift
to the right and the positive ions will drift to the left. The gravity
drift, therefore, causes a charge separation in the plasma and the
resulting boundary has the form shown in fig:RT\_displacement. The
surface charge \(\delta\sigma\) due to the separation
(\(\delta\Delta z\)) of ions and electrons is given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta\sigma&=Ne\delta\Delta z \\
&=Ne\frac{\partial \Delta z}{\partial y}\delta y \\
&=e\frac{\partial \Delta z}{\partial y}V_g \delta t
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the time rate of change of the surface charge density is
given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RT_time_rate_surface_charge}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial t}&=NeV_g\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Delta z \\
&=-Ne\frac{Mg}{eB}ak\cos ky \\
&=-\frac{NMeg}{B}ak\cos ky
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:RT_time_rate_surface_charge}\end{equation}

where in writing these expressions, we have neglected the electron
drift, as being small in the ratio \(m/M\) compared to the ion drift.
The electric field resulting from the surface charge can be computed in
a straight-forward manner. In the region away from the boundary, we must
have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RT_dielectric}{}{
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\mathbf{E})=0
}\label{eq:RT_dielectric}\end{equation}

where
\(\epsilon=\epsilon_0\big( 1+\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{{\Omega_i}^2}\big)=...\)
is the dielectric constant of the plasma. At the interface the electric
field is determined by

\[
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\mathbf{E})=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\frac{\sigma}{dz}
\]

where \(\sigma\) is the surface charge density and \(\mathrm{d}z\) is
the infinitesimal thickness of the layer. We now integrate this equation
over an element of volumn \(\mathrm{d}S\mathrm{d}z\). The right-hand
side gives the charge within the column element (\(\sigma\mathrm{d}S\)).
Making use of Gauss`s theorem to transform the left-hand side, we obtain

\[
\epsilon E_z dS = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\sigma dS = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\sigma_0 \cos ky dS
\]

Thus the electric field at the interface is given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RT_surface_bc}{}{
\epsilon E_z = \frac{\sigma_0}{\mu_0}\cos ky
}\label{eq:RT_surface_bc}\end{equation}

The electric field which satisfies Equation~\ref{eq:RT_dielectric}
within the plasma and the boundary condition
Equation~\ref{eq:RT_surface_bc} at \(z=0\) has the components

\[
\begin{aligned}
E_y &= \frac{\sigma_0}{\mu_0\epsilon}\sin ky\, e^{-kz} \\
E_z &= \frac{\sigma_0}{\mu_0\epsilon}\cos ky\, e^{-kz}
\end{aligned}
\]

with \(E_x=0\). These electric fields give rise to the drifts which can
be computed from the equation

\[
\mathbf{V}=\frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]

Remembering that \(\mathbf{B}\) is in the x-direction, we obtain

\[
V_y = \frac{E_z}{B},\quad V_z = -\frac{E_y}{B}
\]

From the foregoing equations we obtain

\[
\begin{aligned}
V_y &= \frac{\sigma_0}{\mu_0 B}\cos ky\, e^{-kz} \\
V_z &=-\frac{\sigma_0}{\mu_0 B}\sin ky\, e^{-kz}
\end{aligned}
\]

It is clear from the solutions that the velocity field is divergence
free and, therefore, does not cause any change in the density of the
plasma except at the boundary. We have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RT_vel_boundary}{}{
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Delta z(z=0)=V_z(z=0) = -\frac{\sigma}{\mu_0 B}\sin ky
}\label{eq:RT_vel_boundary}\end{equation}

From Equation~\ref{eq:RT_displacement_z} and
Equation~\ref{eq:RT_vel_boundary}, we obtain the equation of motion for
the amplitude \(a\):

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}a}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{\sigma_0}{\mu_0 B}
\]

Equation~\ref{eq:RT_time_rate_surface_charge} and
Equation~\ref{eq:RT_surface_bc} yield

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_0}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{NMg}{\mu_0B}ak
\]

From the above two equations, we obtain

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 a}{\mathrm{d}t^2} &= \frac{1}{\mu_0\epsilon B}\frac{NMg}{B}ka \\
&\approx gka, \quad(\text{for } \epsilon \gg 1)
\end{aligned}
\]

(\(g=...\) from equilibrium). The solution of this equation is given by

\[
a(t) = a_0e^{\pm\sqrt{gk} t}
\]

It is interesting to note that the rate of growth of the instability is
exactly the same as in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a fluid
supported against gravity by a second fluid which is weightless. The
charge separation is able to overcome exactly the restraining influence
of the magnetic field. This exact compensation occurs only in the limit
of \(\epsilon\gg1\).

The same result can also be obtained using the rigorous formulation of
the Boltzmann transport equation. However, in more complicated cases,
the first order orbit theory gives results which agree with those
obtained from the Boltzmann equation only in some special cases.

The essential mechanism which gives rise to the instability is the
charge separation resulting from the gravity drift --- drift arising
from a force which does not depend upon the sign of the charge. If we
consider a plasma configuration in a torus, the particles experience the
centrifugal force \(m{v_\parallel}^2/R\) and the gradient B force
\(m{v_\perp}^2/R\) which are both independent of the sign of the charge.
Therefore, we should expect instabilities in a plasma confined to a
torus.

\hypertarget{sec:KH}{%
\section{Kelvin-Helmholtz instability}\label{sec:KH}}

Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability happens due to velocity shear. Typical
examples are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  plane crash
\item
  flapping of flags
\item
  diocotron instability in an electron sheet
\item
  water wave, nonlinear phase
\item
  laser ablation of metal
\end{itemize}

To understand why shear flow can lead to instability, we'll first
introduce the Bernoulli theorem in fluid mechanics. From the MHD
momentum equation, take
\(\partial/\partial t=0,\ \mathbf{J}=0,\ \mathbf{g}=0\), we obtain

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}=-\nabla p
\end{aligned}
\]

Using the natural coordinates, let \(\hat{t}\) be the unit tangent
vector on a streamline, \(\hat{n}\) be the unit normal vector pointing
from concave to convex side, and \(ds\) be the infinitisimal distance
along streamline, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v} &= (\rho v\frac{\partial }{\partial s})\mathbf{v} =\rho v_s \frac{\partial }{\partial s}(\hat{t} v) =\rho v \Big( \frac{\partial v}{\partial s}\hat{t} + \frac{\partial \hat{t}}{\partial s}v\Big) \\
&=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial s}\hat{t}-\nabla_\perp p\\
\Rightarrow \hat{t}:\ pv\frac{\partial v}{\partial s}+\frac{\partial p}{\partial s}&=\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\Big( \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + p \Big) = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, \(\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + p = \text{const.}\) along a
streamline for an incompressible flow. This is the classical Bernoulli
equation.

Now, consider two flow layer with velocity shear at the plane interface
in fig:two\_layer (ADD FIGURE!). Imaging there's a ripple on the layer
interface pointing upward at \(Q\). If we examine the cross section at
\(P\) and \(Q\) for the lower layer respectively, we find

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{flux at P} = \rho v A|_P = \text{flux at Q} = \rho v A|_Q
\end{aligned}
\]

Since density along field lines are constant (incompressible) and area
\(A_P<A_Q\), we have \(v_P>v_Q\). From the Bernoulli equation,
\(p_P<p_Q\). Similar for the upper layer, we get the pressure at \(P\)
is larger than that at \(Q\). Therefore, the total pressure is pointing
away from interface, which let the ripple grow.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:two_layer_flow}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/electron_sheet.png}
\caption{Two layers of flow with a velocity shear at the plane
interface.}\label{fig:two_layer_flow}
}
\end{figure}

Now we are ready to do more careful derivations. The governing equations
are

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}&=0 \\
\rho\Big( \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}\Big) &= -\nabla p \\
\end{aligned}
\]

In equilibrium, suppose there is a velocity shear in the x direction,
and the interface lies along the y direction,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho_0 &= \text{const.} \\
p_0 &= \text{const.} \\
\mathbf{v}_0 &= \hat{y}v_{0y}(x)
\end{aligned}
\]

Assume linear perturbations of the form

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_{1x}(\mathbf{x},t) &= v_{1x}(x)e^{i k_y y-i\omega t} \\
p_1(\mathbf{x},t) &= p_1(x)e^{i k_y y-i\omega t}
\end{aligned}
\]

so the linearized momentum equation is

\[
\rho_0\big( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_1}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}_0\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}_1 +\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}_0 \big) = -\nabla p_1
\]

where

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{v}_0\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}_1 &= i k_y v_{0y} \mathbf{v}_1 \\
\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}_0 &= v_{1x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}v_{0y}(x)\hat{y}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then the x and y components of the linearized momentum equation give

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega \rho_0 v_{1x} +\rho_0 i k_y v_{0y}v_{1x} &= -\frac{\partial p_1}{\partial x} \\
-i\omega \rho_0 v_{1y} + \rho_0 i k_y v_{0y}v_{1y} + \rho_0 v_{1x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}v_{0y}(x) &= -ik_y p_1
\end{aligned}
\]

Together with the linearized incompressibility condition

\[
\frac{\partial v_{1x}}{\partial x} + ik_y v_{1y}  = 0
\]

by eliminating \(p_1\) and \(v_{1y}\) we get

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:KH_governing}{}{
\frac{\partial^2 v_{1x}}{\partial x^2} - \Big[ {k_y}^2 - \frac{k_y {v_{0y}}^{\prime\prime}(x)}{\omega-k_y v_{0y}(x)} \Big]v_{1x} = 0
}\label{eq:KH_governing}\end{equation}

Now we are half way from obtaining the dispersion relation. For
simplicity, let us assume three layer regions with Region I on the left
(\(x<0\)), Region II in the middle (\(x\in(0,\tau)\)), and Region III on
the right (\(x>\tau\)). Let the shear layer II thickness be \(\tau\).
Set the velocity on the two sides
\(v_1 = 0,\ v_2 = v_1+\Delta v \equiv v\), and \(k_y=k\). Then

\[
v_{0y}^{\prime\prime}(x) = \Big(\frac{v}{\tau}\Big)\big[ \delta(x) - \delta(x-\tau)\big]
\]

except at \(x=0\) and \(x=\tau\). Equation~\ref{eq:KH_governing} can be
simplified to

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 v_{1x}}{\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2 v_{1x} = 0
\]

In region I (\(x<0\)),

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_{1x} &= \xi_0 e^{kx},\quad x<0 \\
\frac{\partial v_{1x}}{\partial x}\big|_{x=0_-} &= k\xi_0
\end{aligned}
\]

In region III (\(x>\tau\)),

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_{1x} &= \xi_\tau e^{-k(x-\tau)},\quad x>\tau \\
\frac{\partial v_{1x}}{\partial x}\big|_{x=\tau^+} &= -k\xi_\tau
\end{aligned}
\]

In region II (\(x\in(0,\tau)\)), we are looking for a solution which is
a superposition of the solutions from both sides and is continuous at
the boundaries

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_{1x} &=\xi_\tau \frac{\sinh{kx}}{\sinh{k\tau}} + \xi_0\frac{\sinh{k(x-\tau)}}{\sinh{-k\tau}},\quad 0<x<\tau \\
\frac{\partial v_{1x}}{\partial x}\big|_{x=\tau^-} &= k\xi_\tau \frac{\cosh{k\tau}}{\sinh{k\tau}} - k\xi_0\frac{1}{\sinh{k\tau}} \\
 \frac{\partial v_{1x}}{\partial x}\big|_{x=0^+} &= k\xi_\tau \frac{1}{\sinh{k\tau}} - k\xi_0\frac{\cosh{k\tau}}{\sinh{k\tau}}
\end{aligned}
\]

The continuity at \(x = 0\) requires \(V_{0y}=0, V_{1x}=\xi_0\).
Integrating the governing Equation~\ref{eq:KH_governing} from \(x=0^-\)
to \(x=0^+\) yields

\[
-\xi_0 k\frac{\cosh{k\tau}}{\sinh{k\tau}} + \xi_\tau k\frac{1}{\sinh{k\tau}} - k\xi_0 + \frac{kv}{\omega\tau}\xi_0 = 0
\]

Integrating the governing Equation~\ref{eq:KH_governing} from
\(x=\tau^-\) to \(x=\tau^+\) yields

\[
-\xi_\tau k +\xi_0 k\frac{1}{\sinh{k\tau}} - \xi_\tau k\frac{\cosh{k\tau}}{\sinh{k\tau}} - \frac{kv}{\omega\tau}\xi_\tau = 0
\]

Combining the last two equations, we obtain

\[
1 = \Big[ \sinh{k\tau} + \cosh{k\tau} + \frac{kv}{\omega-kv}\frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big] \Big[ \cosh{k\tau}+\sinh{k\tau} - \frac{kv}{\omega}\frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big]
\]

which is the dispersion relation.

With the identity \(\sinh{k\tau} + \cosh{k\tau} = e^{k\tau}\), the
dispersion relation can be simplified to

\[
\begin{aligned}
1 &= \Big[ e^{k\tau} + \frac{kv}{\omega-kv}\frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big] \Big[ e^{k\tau} - \frac{kv}{\omega}\frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big] \\
1 &= e^{2k\tau} +e^{k\tau}\frac{(k\tau)^2}{\omega(\omega-kv)}\frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau} - \frac{(k\tau)^2}{\omega(\omega-k\tau)}\Big(\frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big)^2 \\
1 &= e^{2k\tau} + \frac{(k\tau)^2}{\omega(\omega-kv)} \frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau} \Big[ e^{k\tau} - \frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\omega(\omega-kv)\), we get

\[
\omega(\omega-k\tau)(1-e^{2k\tau}) = (kv)^2  \frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau} \Big[ e^{k\tau} - \frac{\sinh{k\tau}}{k\tau}\Big]
\]

Assuming \(k\tau\ll 1\) (long wavelength approximation),
\(e^{k\tau}\approx 1+k\tau\), we obtain

\[
\omega(\omega-kv) + \frac{(kv)^2}{2} \approx 0
\]

the solution of which is

\[
\omega=\frac{1}{2}kv(1\pm i),\quad k\tau \ll 1
\]

In general, the growth rate of KH is

\[
\omega_i = \frac{1}{2}|k_y \Delta v|,\quad k_y\tau\ll 1
\]

\hypertarget{diocotron-instability-on-electron-sheet}{%
\subsection{Diocotron instability on electron
sheet}\label{diocotron-instability-on-electron-sheet}}

HAVEN'T CHECKED!

A diocotron instability is a plasma instability created by two sheets of
charge slipping past each other. Energy is dissipated in the form of two
surface waves propagating in opposite directions, with one flowing over
the other. This instability is the plasma analog of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in fluid mechanics.

For the simplest case, we have a uniform electron sheet and a parallel
constant magnetic field in the plane of the sheet, as illustrated in
fig:electron\_sheet. Due to space charge of electron sheet, there is
electric field pointing towards the sheet in the upper and lower region.
Consider a small perturbation (sinusoidal ripple) on an electron sheet.
The coulomb force expels electrons outward, so the electrons will drift,
according to the right-hand rule, to the left. The deficit of electrons
is equivalent to some positive charge distribution, and thus created an
electric field. The \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift is pointing
outward, so the perturbation is growing. Note that even though this
problem looks innocent, but it is actually not easy. People, even the
giants in plasma physics, made a lot of mistakes in the derivation!

If there is also a magnetic field inside the sheet, the
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift will form a velocity gradient
within the sheet, and lead to K-H instability. Denote \(\sigma_0\) as
the surface charge density and \(\rho_0\) as charge density, we have \[
\sigma_0 = \rho_0 \tau = en_0\tau,
\] and the velocity shear across the sheet \[
\Delta v = \frac{E_2}{B_0} + \frac{E_1}{B_0} = -\frac{1}{B_0}\frac{\sigma_0}{\epsilon_0}=-\frac{en_0\tau}{B_0 \epsilon_0}.
\] Then from the dispersion relation of K-H mode, we have the growth

FIGURE NEEDED from H.W.3.4 Consider the diocotron instabity on a
MELBA-like annular electron beam which propagates inside a metallic
drift tube. Let \$V = \$ beam voltage, \(I =\) beam current, \(a =\)
beam radius, \(\tau=\) annular beam thickness (\(\tau\ll 1\))m \(L=\)
length of drift tube, \$T = \$ beam's pulselength, \(B=\) axial magnetic
field. Note that the combined self-electric and self-magnetic field of
the beam produces a slow rotational \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift
in the \(\theta-\)direction. This azimuthal drift velocity,
\(v_{0\theta}\), is much less than the axial velocity of the beam, but
it is sheared.

In equilibrium,

\[
\begin{aligned}
0&=q(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{E}) \\
\mathbf{v}&=v_{0\theta}\hat{\theta} + v_{0z}\hat{z} \\
\mathbf{B}&=B_{0\theta}\hat{\theta} + B_{0z}\hat{z} \\
\Rightarrow & v_\theta - v_z B_\theta + E_r = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

From Ampère's law,

\[
\begin{aligned}
B_{0\theta}\cdot 2\pi (a+\tau) \approx B_\theta \cdot 2\pi a = \mu_0 2\pi a \tau J_z \\
\Rightarrow J_z = \frac{1}{\mu_0\tau} B_{0\theta} = -en_0 V_{0z}
\end{aligned}
\]

From Gauss's law,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{-en_0}{\epsilon_0} \\
E_r\cdot 2\pi a \Delta = \frac{-en_0}{\epsilon_0}\cdot 2\pi a\tau \Delta \\
\Rightarrow E_r = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\tau(-e)n_0
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituing \(E_r\) and \(J_z\) into the radial force balance equation,
we obtain

\[
\begin{aligned}
V_{\theta}\big|_{r=a+\tau} &= \frac{1}{B_{z}}[V_{0z}B_\theta - E_r]\big|_{r=a+\tau}\\
&=\frac{1}{\gamma^2}\frac{E_r}{B_z}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\gamma=(1-\beta)^{-1/2}=1+V/(511\text{ keV})\), and
\(\beta= V_{0z}/c\).

Let \(\nu=\frac{I}{\beta I_A}\) be the Budker parameter,
\(I_A=4\pi\epsilon_0 mc^2/e=17\,\text{kA}\) be the Alfvén-Lawson
current, and \(\Omega=\frac{eB_{0z}}{m_e}\) be the nonrelativistic
cyclotron frequency associated with the axial B field, we have

\[
V_\theta\big|_{r=a+\tau} = \frac{2c^2\nu}{\Omega a\gamma^2}
\]

At \(r=a\), \(V_\theta=0\) because there's no E field. Therefore the
velocity shear in \(\hat{\theta}\) is

\[
\Delta V_{\theta} = V_\theta\big|_{r=a+\tau} - V_\theta\big|_{r=a} =\frac{2c^2\nu}{\Omega a \gamma^2}
\]

Then from the analysis of K-H instability, the temporal growth rate
\(\omega_i\) is given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\omega_i &= \frac{1}{2}|k_\theta \Delta V_{0\theta}| \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{a}\frac{2c^2\nu}{\Omega a \gamma^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

For long wavelength limit, let \(m=1\).

For MELBA-like beam with the following parameters,
\(V=700\text{keV},\ I=1\text{kA},\ a = 5\text{cm},\ \tau=0.5\text{cm},\ T=500\text{ns},\ L=1\text{m},\ B=2\text{kG}\),

\[
\omega_i =1.18\times 10^7 \text{s}^{-1}
\]

The total number of e-folds of the instability growth during the pulse
time T is

\[
\omega_i T \approx 5.9
\]

Even though this is large, K-H instability will not stay at the initial
position and grow in time; instead it will be transported. It is more
meaningful to estimate the spatial growth by evaluating the total number
of e-folds experienced by a signal of some frequency as it propagates
along the machine length L:

\[
k_i L =\frac{\omega_i}{V_{0z}}L = \omega_i \frac{L}{\beta c}\approx 0.04
\]

Therefore we don't need to worry too much about this instability.

\hypertarget{mhd-stability}{%
\section{MHD Stability}\label{mhd-stability}}

\[
\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} = \nabla p
\]

\[
\mathbf{J}_\perp = \frac{\mathbf{B}\times\nabla p}{B^2}
\]

The current is often called the \emph{diamagnetic current}. It arises
from the plasma pressure gradient.

Using Ampère's law we can write the magnetic force in the form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_force}{}{
\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} = -\nabla\Big( \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\Big) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}
}\label{eq:mhd_force}\end{equation}

which separates into the magnetic pressure term and the magnetic tension
term.

If we use an anisotropic description of the thermal pressure term,
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_force} can be written as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_force_anisotropic}{}{
\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} = -\nabla_\perp\left( p_\perp + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\right) + \left( 1+\frac{p_\perp - p_\parallel}{B^2/\mu_0}\right)\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{B}
}\label{eq:mhd_force_anisotropic}\end{equation}

\subsection{Harris Current Sheet}\label{sec:harris_cs}}

An example of a MHD equilibrium configuration is the Harris current
sheet, in which the variations in the magnetic field and plasma pressure
over the current sheet balance each other In a 1D Harris current sheet
the magnetic field (assumed here to be in the \(z\)-direction) is given
by

\[
\mathbf{B} = B_0 \tanh\Big( \frac{z}{\lambda} \Big) \hat{y}
\]

The pressure is given by

\[
p = p_0 \cosh^{-2}\frac{z}{\lambda}
\]

where \(p_0 = B_0^2/(2\mu_0)\). The current density is then

\[
J_y(z) = \frac{B_0}{\mu_0 \lambda}\text{sech}^2\Big(\frac{z}{\lambda}\Big)
\]

Harris current sheet can be taken as the first approximation of the
Earth's magnetotail that can stay stable for long time periods.

\hypertarget{ux3b8-pinch-and-z-pinch}{%
\subsection{θ-Pinch and Z-Pinch}\label{ux3b8-pinch-and-z-pinch}}

θ-pinch and Z-Pinch are both 1D equilibrium configurations expressed in
cylindrical coordinates. In a θ-pinch cylindrical coils drive an elecric
current and the magnetic field is axial, while in a Z-pinch the electric
current is axial and the magnetic field is toroidal.

\hypertarget{force-free-field}{%
\subsection{Force-Free Field}\label{force-free-field}}

If \(\beta\ll 1\) in MHD equilibrium, the pressure gradient is
negligible and thus

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_force_free}{}{
\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} = 0
}\label{eq:mhd_force_free}\end{equation}

Such configurations are called \emph{force-free fields} because the
magnetic force on the plasma is zero. According to
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_force} in a force-free field the magnetic pressure
gradient \(\nabla(B^2/2\mu_0)\) is balanced by the magnetic tension
force \(\mu_0^{-1}(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}\). In reality the
force-free equilibrium is often a very good approximation of the
momentum equation. It is also evident from
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_force_free} that in a force-free field the electric
current flows along the magnetic field. Such currents are commonly
called \emph{field-aligned currents} (FAC).

Using Ampère's law we can write Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_force_free} as

\[
(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B} = 0
\]

From this we see that the innocent-looking equation
\(\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}=0\) is in fact nonlinear and thus difficult
to solve.

The field-alignment of the electric crrent can be expressed as

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} = \alpha(\mathbf{r})\mathbf{B}
\]

where \(\alpha\) is a function of position. Taking divergence of this we
get

\[
\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\alpha = 0
\]

i.e.~\(\alpha\) is constant along the magnetic field.

In the case \(\alpha\) is \emph{a constant in all directions}, the
equation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:b_alpha_constant}{}{
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \alpha\mathbf{B}
}\label{eq:b_alpha_constant}\end{equation}

is linear. Taking a curl Equation~\ref{eq:b_alpha_constant} we get the
\emph{Helmholtz equation}:

\[
\nabla^2\mathbf{B} + \alpha^2\mathbf{B} = 0
\]

Solution to the Helmoltz with helical equation in cylindrical symmetry
was presented by Lundquist in 1950 in terms of Bessel functions \(J_0\)
and \(J_1\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
B_R &= 0 \\
B_A &= B_0 J_0\Big( \frac{\alpha_0 r}{r_0} \Big) \\
B_T &= \pm B_0 J_1\Big( \frac{\alpha_0 r}{r_0} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(B_r, B_A\), and \(B_T\) are radial, axial and tangential
magnetic field components, respectively. The solution is a magnetic
\emph{flux rope} where magnetic field lines form helixes whose pitch
angle increases from the axis (Figure~\ref{fig:flux_rope}). \(r\) is the
radial distance from the flux rope axis, \(r_0\) is the radius of the
flux rope and \(B_0\) is the maximum magnetic field magnitude at the
center of the flux rope \(r=0\).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Helical structure of a force-free magnetic
field.}\label{fig:flux_rope}
}
\end{figure}

A special case of a force-free magnetic field is the current-free
configuration \(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=0\). Now the magnetic field can
be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential
\(\mathbf{B}=\nabla\Psi\), and since \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0\) it can
be found via the \emph{Laplace equation}

\[
\nabla^2\Psi = 0
\]

with appropriate boundary conditions and using the methods of potential
theory.

For example, the Sun's magnetic field structure is often modeled by the
so-called Potential Field Source Surface
(\href{https://gong.nso.edu/science/gongpfss/gongpfss.html}{PFSS}) model
(Figure~\ref{fig:PFSS}). The magnetic field is computed from the Laplace
equation using spherical coordinates from the photosphere to the
``source surface'', nominally chosen to be at 2.5 Solar radii. At the
source surface the Sun's magnetic field is assumed to be purely radial.
The inner boundary conditions are obtained from solar magnetograms.
Thus, PFSS assumes that there is no electric current in the corona.

\hypertarget{mhd-modes}{%
\section{MHD Modes}\label{mhd-modes}}

A simple but representative dispersion relation writes

\[
\omega^2=(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{V}_A)^2-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{g},\quad \text{where }\mathbf{V}_A=\frac{\mathbf{B}_0}{B_0}\cdot V_A
\]

If we treat plasma as a single magnetized fluid,

\[
\rho\Big( \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\underbrace{\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla \mathbf{u}}_{\textrm{K-H inst.}} \Big)=\underbrace{-\nabla p}_{\text{ballooning inst.}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}}_{\text{kink, sausage inst.}}+\underbrace{\rho\mathbf{g}}_{\text{R-T inst.}}
\]

Qualitatively, we can identify the source for each kind of instability
in plasma. We will discuss them separately and in a set of combination
below.

\hypertarget{kink-mode}{%
\subsection{Kink Mode}\label{kink-mode}}

A kink instability, is a \emph{current-driven} plasma instability
characterized by transverse displacements of a plasma column's
cross-section from its center of mass without any change in the
characteristics of the plasma. It typically develops in a thin plasma
column carrying a strong axial current which exceeds the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_factor_(plasma_physics)}{Kruskal--Shafranov
limit} and is sometimes known as the Kruskal--Shafranov (kink)
instability.

The kink instability was first widely explored in fusion power machines
with Z-pinch configurations in the 1950s. It is one of the common
magnetohydrodynamic instability modes which can develop in a pinch
plasma and is sometimes referred to as the \(m=1\) mode.

If a ``kink'' begins to develop in a column the magnetic forces on the
inside of the kink become larger than those on the outside, which leads
to growth of the perturbation. As it develops at fixed areas in the
plasma, kinks belong to the class of ``absolute plasma instabilities'',
as opposed to convective processes.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:kink}{%

\caption{Plasma column (poloidal m = 2, toroidal n = 1) kink mode in a
Tokamak.}\label{fig:kink}
}
\end{figure}

The kink instability is the most dangerous instability in Tokamak. We
have discussed this kind of micro-instability from the view of single
particle motion in Section~\ref{sec:particle_motion_instability}; here,
we will explore this a little bit further.

\textbf{String model}

First, image a current-carrying plasma column, shown in the x-z plane in
fig:kink\_column. The metallic wire carries current under tension \(T\),
and \(\mu=\)mass/length is the mass per length. From the basic
mechanics, \(C_s=\sqrt{T/\mu}\) is the acoustic velocity in the system.
Let the background field \(\mathbf{B}_0=\hat{z}B_0\) and the
displacement \(\pmb{\xi}=\pmb{\xi}(\mathbf{x},t)\). We can show that, if
the current \(\mathbf{I}\) is sufficiently strong, there will be kink
instability.

ADD PLASMA KINK COLUMN FIGURE!

Assume the displacement in x-y plane has the form

\[
\pmb{\xi} = (\xi_x,\xi_y)e^{ik_z z-i\omega t}
\]

The force law gives (i.e.~the basic string model in mechanics textbooks)

\[
\mu\frac{\partial^2\pmb{\xi}}{\partial t^2}=T\frac{\partial^2\pmb{\xi}}{\partial z^2}+ \text{force per unit length}
\]

Here, the external force \emph{per length} is the Lorentz force (which
is why we say the R-T instability is current-driven),

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{I}\times\mathbf{B}&=\Big( \hat{x}I\frac{\partial \xi_x}{\partial z}+\hat{y}I\frac{\partial\xi_y}{\partial z}+\hat{z}0 \Big)\times B_0\hat{z} \\
&=IB_0 \Big( \hat{x}\frac{\partial\xi_y}{\partial z}-\hat{y}\frac{\partial \xi_x}{\partial z}\Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

In scalar forms, the force law gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}:\ -\mu\omega^2 \xi_x &= T(-{k_z}^2)\xi_x + IB_0 \frac{\partial \xi_y}{\partial z}\\
\hat{y}:\ -\mu\omega^2\xi_y &= T(-{k_z}^2)\xi_y - IB_0 \frac{\partial \xi_x}{\partial z}
\end{aligned}
\]

Combining these two equations, we can easily get the dispersion relation

\[
\omega^2 = {k_z}^2{C_s}^2 \pm \frac{IB_0}{\mu_0 \mu}k_z
\]

The dispersion relation is a representation of the force-law. The first
term on the right-hand side is a stabilizing term due to tension; the
second term with a minus sign is a destabilizing term due to Lorentz
force. Note that the expression is very similar to R-T instability.
(Which one?)

We can immediately estimate the scenario in a Tokamak. Take the radius
of the column cut as \(a\), wave number \(k_z\sim 1/R\) (i.e.~wave
length is on the order of tokamak radius),
\({C_s}^2={V_A}^2={B_{0z}}^2/(\mu_0\rho_0)\) (i.e.~tension in plasma
give rises to Alfvén wave), then the current is

\[
I=J_z(\pi a^2)=\frac{B_\theta 2\pi a}{\mu_0} \sim \frac{B_\theta a}{\mu_0}
\]

and the mass per unit length is

\[
\mu =\rho_0(\pi a^2) \sim \rho_0 a^2
\]

The criterion for stability then becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
&{k_z}^2{C_s}^2 >\frac{IB_0}{\mu_0}k_z\Rightarrow \frac{1}{R}\frac{{B_0z}^2}{\mu_0\rho_0}>\frac{B_\theta a}{\mu_0}\frac{B_{0z}}{\rho_0 a^2} \\
\Rightarrow &\frac{a}{R}\frac{B_{0z}}{B_{0\theta}}>1
\end{aligned}
\]

which is called the \emph{Kruskal-Shafranov stability criterion}.
Usually we define

\[
q\equiv\frac{a}{R}\frac{B_{0z}}{B_{0\theta}}=\frac{a}{R}\frac{B_t}{B_p}
\]

as the safety factor. A real value for \(q\) is about 2 to 3.

\textbf{Ideal MHD Approach}

Now we use a more standard way to treat the kink mode. (Section 10.9
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan, 2008})) Assume
we have a plasma column with radius \(a\). Inside the column, we assume
infinite conductivity, \(\sigma=\infty\); outside the column, we assume
vacuum so that we can only have current flow on surface \(r=a\). Thus,
besides the universal background magnetic field in the z direction, we
also have an azimuthal field due to surface current. (You will see later
that the decay in \(\theta\) actually drives the kink instability.)

In equilibrium,

\[
\begin{aligned}
r<a:\ &\mathbf{B}_0 = \hat{z}B_0 = \text{const.} \\
& p_0 = \text{const.},\ \mathbf{v}_0 = \text{const.},\ \mathbf{J}_0 = 0,\ \rho_0=\text{const.} \\
r>a:\ & \mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\hat{z} + B_{0\theta}\frac{a}{r}\hat{\theta} \\
& p_0=0,\ \rho_0 = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

The force equation in equilibrium

\[
\nabla p_0 = \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}_0
\]

is satisfied automatically both for \(r>a\) and \(r<a\).

Let us introduce a small perturbation

\[
\pmb{\xi}_{1r}(\mathbf{x},t) = \widetilde{\xi}_{1r}(r)e^{ikz + im\theta-i\omega t}
\]

such that at \(r=a\),

\[
\pmb{\xi}_{1r}(\mathbf{x},t)\big|_{r=a} = \widetilde{\xi}_{1a}(r)e^{ikz + im\theta-i\omega t}
\]

Before running into linearized equations, we can first take a look at
different wave modes. That is, what will the perturbation looks like at
a fixed time \(t\) with different \(m\)? For simplicity, let us assume
\(t=0\). (You can always make a time shift.) The actual displacement is
the real part of \(\pmb{\xi}\),

\[
\xi_{1r} = \xi_{1a}\cos(k_z z+m\theta)
\]

For \(m=0\),

\[
\xi_{1r} = \xi_{1a}\cos(k_z z)
\]

which is the sausage mode.

For \(m=1\),

\[
\xi_{1r} = \xi_{1a}\cos(k_z z+\theta)
\]

If we draw the displacement down for
\(k_z z=0,\frac{\pi}{2},\pi,\frac{3}{2}\pi\), you can see one rotation
in a \(2\pi\) period, which indicates a shape of helix. This is often
called the kink mode.

For higher \(m\),

\[
\xi_{1r} = \xi_{1a}\cos(k_z z+m\theta)
\]

which looks like \(m\) intertwine helixes in one axial wavelength.

Now let's return to the perturbed equations. Here we will assume
incompressibility as the equation of state,

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}=0
\]

The procedure to get the dispersion relation goes as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Express the perturbed magnetic field as a function of displacement
  inside and outside the surface.
\item
  Relate the two regions by total force balance.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\Roman{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \(r<a\)
\end{enumerate}

\[
\mathbf{v}_1=\frac{\partial \pmb{\xi}_1}{\partial t} \Rightarrow \nabla\cdot\pmb{\xi_1}=0
\]

The linearized continuity equation gives

\[
\rho_1 = -\nabla\cdot(\rho_0\pmb{\xi}_1)=-\pmb{\xi}_1 \cdot\nabla\rho_0 - \rho_0\nabla\cdot\pmb{\xi}_1 =0
\]

The linearized force law gives

\[
\rho_0\frac{\partial^2\pmb{\xi}_1}{\partial t^2} = -\nabla p_1 +\frac{(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)\times\mathbf{B}_0}{\mu_0} +\cancel{\mathbf{J}_0}\times\mathbf{B}_1
\]

And the Ohm's law gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}_1}{\partial t} &= \nabla\times\mathbf{E}_1 = \nabla\times(-\mathbf{v}_1\times\mathbf{B}_0) \\
\mathbf{B}_1 &= \nabla\times(\pmb{\xi}_1\times\mathbf{B}_0)=B_0 \nabla\times(\pmb{\xi}_1\times\hat{z})=ik_z B_0\pmb{\xi}_1
\end{aligned}
\]

The last equivalence is obtained from the expansion of the second term
into four terms and cancellation of zero terms.

In cylindrical coordinates,

\[
(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)\times\mathbf{B}_0 = ik{B_0}^2 (\nabla\times\pmb{\xi}_1)\times\hat{z}
\]

and

\[
\nabla\times\pmb{\xi}_1=\frac{1}{r}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{r} & r\hat{\theta} &\hat{z} \\
\partial_r & \partial_\theta & \partial z \\
\xi_{1\theta} & r\xi_{1\theta} & \xi_{1z}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

so the linearized force law gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\omega^2 \xi_{1r} &= -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\frac{\partial p_1}{\partial r} +ik{v_A}^2 \big[ ik\xi_{1r} - \frac{\partial \xi_{1z}}{\partial r}\big] \\
-\omega^2 \xi_{1\theta} &= -\frac{im}{\rho_0 r}p_1 + k{v_A}^2 \big[ -\frac{im}{r}\xi_{1z} + ik\xi_{1\theta} \big] \\
-\omega^2 \xi_{1z}&= -ik_z p_0/\rho_0
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting the expression of \(\xi_{1z}\) into the other two
equations, we can get

\[
\pmb{\xi}_1 = \frac{1}{\omega^2}\nabla\big( \frac{p_1}{\rho_0} \big)
\]

From the incompressibility condition, we have

\[
\nabla\cdot\pmb{\xi}_1=0\Rightarrow \nabla^2 p_1 =0
\]

or in cylindrical coordinates,

\[
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\big( r\frac{\partial p_1}{\partial r} \big) - \frac{m^2 p_1}{r^2} - k^2 p_1 = 0
\]

Assume long wavelength limit and \(m=1\) (kink mode),

\[
kr<ka\ll 1
\]

we have

\[
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\big( r\frac{\partial p_1}{\partial r} \big) - \frac{p_1}{r^2} = 0
\]

the solution of which from Legendre polynomials (I need to check) is

\[
p_1 = Ar + \frac{B}{r} = Ar
\]

because \(p_1\) is finite at \(r=0\).

So we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\pmb{\xi}_1 &= \frac{1}{\omega^2}\nabla\big( \frac{p_1}{\rho_0} \big)=\hat{r}\frac{A}{\rho_0\omega}e^{-i\omega t +i\theta+ikz} \\
\Rightarrow\ \xi_{1ra} &= \frac{A}{\rho_0\omega^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then the perturbed kinetic pressure on the surface is

\[
p_1(r=a^-) = Aa = \rho_0 \omega^2 \xi_{1ra} a,
\]

and the perturbed magnetic field is

\[
\mathbf{B}_1=ikB_0\pmb{\xi}_1 \Rightarrow B_{1z}(r=a^-)=ikB_0 \xi_{1z}=-k^2 B_0\xi_{1ra}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\Roman{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \(r>a\)
\end{enumerate}

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_1=0,\ \nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1=0\Rightarrow \mathbf{B}_1 = \nabla\Psi_1,\ \nabla^2\Psi_1 = 0
\]

The solution of Laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates is

\[
\Psi = \big( \frac{C}{r}+\cancel{D}r\big)e^{-i\omega t+i\theta+ikz}
\]

where \(D=0\) because \(\Psi <\infty\) when \(r\rightarrow\infty\).

The perturbed magnetic field is then

\[
\mathbf{B}_1=\mathbf{B}_{1e}\nabla\Psi = C\big[ -\frac{\hat{r}}{r^2}+i\frac{\hat{\theta}}{r^2}+ik\frac{\hat{z}}{r} \big]e^{-i\omega t+i\theta+ikz}
\]

and at \(r=a\),

\[
\mathbf{B}_{1e}(r=a)=B_{1ra}[\hat{r}-i\hat{\theta}-ika\hat{z}]e^{i\theta+ikz}.
\]

Now, we want to relate \(\xi_{1ra}\) and \(B_{1ra}\) by the
``frozen-in'' law. To first-order approximation, let \(\hat{n}\) be the
direction normal to the perturbed boundary, we have

\[
(\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{B})_1=0
\]

The equation for the perturbed boundary (Eq.(10.146) of
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan, 2008})) gives

\[
r-\xi_r-a =0
\]

so

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{n}&=\frac{\nabla(r-\xi_r-a)}{|\nabla(r-\xi_r-a)|} \\
&=\frac{\hat{r}-\frac{i}{r}\xi_{1ra}\hat{\theta}-ik\xi_{1ra}\hat{z}}{|\hat{r}-\frac{i}{r}\xi_{1ra}\hat{\theta}-ik\xi_{1ra}\hat{z}|} \\
&=\hat{r}-\frac{i}{r}\xi_{1ra}\hat{\theta}-ik\xi_{1ra}\hat{z}
\end{aligned}
\]

where the last equivalence holds because \(\xi_{1ra}/r\) and
\(k\xi_{1ra}\) are both second-order in magnitude.

Therefore we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
(\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{B})_1 = ( \hat{r}-\frac{i}{r}\xi_{1ra}\hat{\theta}-ik\xi_{1ra}\hat{z} )\cdot (B_{1r}\hat{r}+B_{0\theta}\hat{\theta}+B_{0z}\hat{z})=0 \\
B_{1r} = B_{0\theta}\frac{i\xi_{1ra}}{a}+ik_z\xi_{1ra}B_{0z}=  B_{1ra} = \frac{i\xi_{1ra}}{a}[B_{0\theta}+k_z a B_{0z}] = i\xi_{1ra}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B})
\end{aligned}
\]

where
\(\mathbf{k}=k_\theta \hat{\theta}+k_z\hat{z}=\frac{m}{r}\hat{\theta}+k_z\hat{z}=\frac{m}{a}\hat{\theta}+k_z\hat{z}\).

Finally, \(p+B^2/2\mu_0\) is continuous across perturbed boundary,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Big( p+\frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\Big)_{1,interior} &= p_{1i} + \frac{2\mathbf{B}_{oi}\cdot\mathbf{B}_{1i}}{2\mu_0}=\rho_0\omega^2 a\xi_{1ra} - \frac{1}{\mu_0}k^2{B_0}^2a\xi_{1ra}=a\rho_0\xi_{1ra}(\omega^2-k^2{v_A}^2) \\
\Big( p+\frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\Big)_{1,exterior}&=0+\frac{1}{2\mu_0}[{B_{0e}}^2+2\mathbf{B}_{oe}\cdot\mathbf{B}_1e]_{1,r=a+\xi_r} \\
&=\frac{1}{2\mu_0}\Big[ \cancel{{B_{0ze}}^2}+{B_{0\theta a}}^2\big( \frac{a}{a+\xi_{1r}}\big)^2+2(B_{0\theta}B_{1e\theta}+B_{0z}B_{1ez})\Big]_1 \\
&=\frac{1}{2\mu_0}\Big[ -\frac{2\xi_{1ra}{B_{0\theta a}}^2}{a}+2\big[ B_{0\theta}(-iB_{1ra})+B_{0z}(-ikaB_{1ra})\big]\Big]\\
&=\frac{1}{2\mu_0}\Big[ -\frac{2\xi_{1ra}{B_{0\theta a}}^2}{a}+\frac{2\xi_{1ra}}{a}\big[ B_{0\theta}+kaB_{0z}\big]^2\Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

where in one of the equivalence \(\frac{\xi_{1ra}}{a}\rightarrow0\),

\[
\Big( \frac{1}{1+\frac{\xi_{1r}}{a}}\Big)^2 \approx -2\frac{\xi_{1ra}}{a}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Big( p+\frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\Big)_{1,interior} &= \Big( p+\frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\Big)_{1,exterior} \\
\omega^2&=k^2{v_A}^2 + \frac{1}{a\mu_0 a^2 \rho_0}\big[ k^2 a^2{B_{0z}}^2+2kaB_{0\theta}B_{0z} \big]\\
\omega^2&= \frac{1}{a\mu_0 a^2 \rho_0}\big[2 k^2 a^2{B_{0z}}^2+2kaB_{0\theta}B_{0z} \big]
=\frac{2k^2{B_{0z}}^2}{\mu_0\rho_0}\Big[ 1+\frac{B_{0\theta}}{kaB_{0z}}\Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

For stability,
\(1>\big| \frac{B_{0\theta}}{ka B_{0z}}\big|\Rightarrow |ka|>\frac{B_{0\theta}}{B_{0z}}\).
Take \(|k|=R^{-1}\), where \(R\) is the major radius, the stability
condition becomes

\[
q\equiv \frac{a}{R}\frac{B_{0z}}{B_{0\theta}}>1
\]

and the \(q\) the called the safety factor. This is again the
Kruskal-Shafranov limit for \(m=1\) kink mode. For sausage mode \(m=0\),
the same approach as above can get

\[
B_{0\theta}< \sqrt{2} B_{0z}
\]

for stability.

\textbf{3-Region Problem}

In 572 HW3.1, we have shown that a Cartesian liner is always stable for
kink and sausage mode while a cylindrical liner isn't. However, if you
also consider the gravity (or equivalently, centrifugal forc, etc.) then
you can have magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability.

Here we show the derivation of dispersion relation in a 3-region problem
in Cartesian liner. This method can be found in Chandrasekhar`s book on
instability, P429. Consider Fig.1 shown in Prof.Lau's paper ``Anisotropy
and feedthrough in magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability''. The interface
of the regions are \(x=\alpha,\ x=\beta\). The governing equation
including gravity is

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\Big\{ \rho_0\big[ \omega^2-(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big] \frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x} \Big\}
- k^2 \big[ \rho_0\big( \omega^2 - (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big)+g\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial x}\big] \xi_{1x} = 0
\]

If
\(\rho_0=\text{const.}\Rightarrow g\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial x}=0\).
Within region I, II, and III, the governing equation can be simplified
to

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \xi_{1x}}{\mathrm{d}x^2} - k^2\xi_{1x} = 0
\]

the general solution of which reads

\[
\xi_{1x} = Ae^{-kx} + Be^{kx} = C\sinh{k(x-\alpha)} + D\sinh{k(x-\beta)}
\]

where \(A,B,C,D\) are coefficients. Cancelling out the unphysical
solutions in each region, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{I: }& \xi_{1x} = \xi_\beta e^{k(x-\beta)} \\
\text{II: }& \xi_{1x} = \xi_\alpha \frac{\sinh{k(x-\beta)}}{\sinh{k(\alpha-\beta)}} + \xi_\beta \frac{\sinh{k(x-\alpha)}}{\sinh{k(\beta-\alpha)}} \\
\text{III: }& \xi_{1x} = \xi_\alpha e^{-k(x-\alpha)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that there's a jump for \(\rho_0(x)\) at \(x=\alpha,\beta\). Now we
can integrate the governing equation across the boundaries,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{x=\alpha^-}^{x=\alpha^+} \mathrm{d}x \Big[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\Big\{ \rho_0\big[ \omega^2-(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big] \frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x} \Big\}
- k^2 \big[ \rho_0\big( \omega^2 - (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big)+g\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial x}\big] \xi_{1x}  \Big]= 0 \\
\Rightarrow F_1(\xi_\alpha,\xi_\beta) = 0 \\
\int_{x=\beta^-}^{x=\beta^+} \mathrm{d}x \Big[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\Big\{ \rho_0\big[ \omega^2-(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big] \frac{\partial \xi_{1x}}{\partial x} \Big\}
- k^2 \big[ \rho_0\big( \omega^2 - (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}_A)^2\big)+g\frac{\partial \rho_0}{\partial x}\big] \xi_{1x}  \Big]= 0 \\
\Rightarrow F_2(\xi_\alpha,\xi_\beta) = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Finally, from \(F_1\) and \(F_2\), we can get the dispersion relation

\[
\omega^4 - R\omega^2  + S = 0
\]

where \(R\) and \(S\) are functions of
\(B_{01},B_{02},B_{03},\rho_{01},\rho_{02},\rho_{03},g,\Delta,k_y\) and
\(k_z\).

Next, we can examine the temporal evolution of sinusoidal ripples at
interfaces in the form

\[
\xi_{\alpha,\beta}(t) = A_1 e^{i\omega_1 t}+A_2 e^{-i\omega_3 t}+A_3e^{i\omega_3 t}  + A_4 e^{-i\omega_3 t}
\]

where \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_3\) are two eigen mode from the
dispersion relation. See the details in the paper. The details of
dispersion relation is given in M.Weis, et. al., Phys. Plasmas 21,
122708 (2014), and the coulping of MRT, sausage and kink mode in a
cyclindrical liner is given by M.Weis, et. al., Phys. Plasma 22, 032706
(2015).

Note: for RT/MRT,

\[
\xi_{RT}(t) \sim\xi_0 e^{\gamma t} < \xi_0 e^{\sqrt{gk}t}
\]

the growth rate

\[
\gamma_{\max} = \sqrt{gk}
\]

If we use \(s=\frac{1}{2}gt^2\Rightarrow \sqrt{2s}=\sqrt{|g|}t\),

\[
\xi_{RT}(t)<\xi_0 e^{\sqrt{2ks}}
\]

which only depends on wavenumber and distance.

\hypertarget{sausage-mode}{%
\subsection{Sausage Mode}\label{sausage-mode}}

The \(m=0\) mode is known as the sausage instability. There is no
\(B_z\) so we have purely toroidal field. The initial equilibrium is
established with radially inward Lorentz force and outward pressure
gradient. But it is unstable to interchange due to curvature. When a
perturbation that causes the rings to shrink, magnetic field in the
plasma increases so that the \(\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}\) Lorentz
force increases. There is nothing to counter this radially inward force
increase, which leads to instability.

The dispersion relation is

\[
\omega^2 = -2\frac{p_0}{\rho_0}\frac{k}{R_c^2}
\]

Adding \(B_z\) to the interior plasma stabilizes sausage instability:
the magnetic pressure caused by \(B_z\) pushes back to oppose squeezing.
The pressure balance at the interface gives

\[
p_0 + \frac{B_{0z}^2}{2\mu_0} = \frac{B_\phi^2}{2\mu_0}
\]

With the modified dispersion relation

\[
\omega^2 = -2\frac{p_0}{\rho_0 a^2} + \frac{B_{0z}^2}{\mu_0\rho_0 a^2}
\]

we have the condition for stability

\[
B_{0z}^2 > \frac{1}{2}B_\phi^2
\]

THIS IS PROBABLY DUPLICATE WITH THE PREVIOUS SECTION.

\hypertarget{kink-mode-1}{%
\subsection{Kink Mode}\label{kink-mode-1}}

However, even when the sausage mode is suppressed, the configuration is
still unstable to the kink mode. This \(m=1\) mode retains circular
cross-section of the tube and the perturbation is a kink of the tube
into a helix. Without \(B_z\), the system is unstable for all \(k\);
with \(B_z\), it is unstable for wavelengths long enough such that the
pitch of the perturbation follows the pitch of the helix, i.e.~the
crests/troughs of the perturbations follow the fieldlines of tube

\[
B_\phi/R + k B_Z \ge 0
\]

In terms of a twist \(\Phi = 2LB_\phi/RB_z\), this criterion is
equivalent to

\[
k\ge-\frac{\Phi}{2L}
\]

The perturbation Lorentz force \(\mathbf{j}_1\times\mathbf{B}_0\) is
zero. (???)

\hypertarget{sec:ballooning}{%
\subsection{Ballooning Mode}\label{sec:ballooning}}

The ballooning instability is a type of internal pressure-driven plasma
instability usually seen in tokamak fusion power reactors or in space
plasmas (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hameiri1991ballooning}{Hameiri et al.,
1991}). It is important in fusion research as it determines a set of
criteria for the maximum achievable plasma beta. The name refers to the
shape and action of the instability, which acts like the elongations
formed in a long balloon when it is squeezed. In literature, the
structure of these elongations are commonly referred to as ``fingers''.

The narrow fingers of plasma produced by the instability are capable of
accelerating and pushing aside the surrounding magnetic field in order
to cause a sudden, explosive release of energy. Thus, the instability is
also known as the explosive instability.

The interchange instability can be derived from the equations of the
ballooning instability as a special case in which the ballooning mode
does not perturb the equilibrium magnetic
field.(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hameiri1991ballooning}{Hameiri et al.,
1991}) This special limit is known as the Mercier criterion.

}
\end{figure}

Tearing mode is closely related to magnetic reconnection
(Section~\ref{sec:reconnection}). The reconnection process is very
important because it is one of the main way of burst energy
transformation. It is known that in collisionless systems current sheets
are unstable against tearing instability, a process where the current
tends to collapse into filaments. The tearing instability produces
magnetic islands that then interact and merge together giving rise to a
nonlinear instability phase, where the reconnection process is enhanced.
See (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bellan2008fundamentals}{Bellan, 2008}) P413
for more.

\textbf{Linear Tearing Mode}

Consider the interface between two plasmas containing magnetic fields of
different orientations. The simplest imaginable field configuration is
that illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:tearing_config_simple}. Here, the
field varies only in the \(x\)-direction, and points only in the
\(y\)-direction. The field is directed in the \(-y\)-direction for
\(x<0\), and in the \(+y-\)direction for \(x>0\). The interface is
situated at \(x=0\). The sudden reversal of the field direction across
the interface gives rise to a \(z\)-directional current sheet at
\(x=0\).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:tearing_config_simple}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasmahtml/img1924.png}
\caption{A reconnection magnetic field
configuration.}\label{fig:tearing_config_simple}
}
\end{figure}

With the neglect of plasma resistivity, the field configuration shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tearing_config_simple} represents a stable equilibrium
state, assuming, of course, that we have normal pressure balance across
the interface. But, does the field configuration remain stable when we
take resistivity into account? If not, we expect an instability to
develop which relaxes the configuration to one possessing lower magnetic
energy. As we shall see, this type of relaxation process inevitably
entails the breaking and reconnection of magnetic field lines, and is,
therefore, termed \emph{magnetic reconnection}. The magnetic energy
releases during the reconnection process eventually appears as plasma
thermal energy. Thus, magnetic reconnection also involves plasma
heating.

In the following, we shall outline the standard method for determining
the linear stability of the type of magnetic field configuration shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:tearing_config_simple}, taking into account the
effect of plasma resistivity. We are particularly interested in plasma
instabilities which are stable in the absence of resistivity, and only
grow when the resistivity is non-zero. Such instabilities are
conventionally termed \emph{tearing modes}. Since magnetic reconnection
is, in fact, a nonlinear process, we shall then proceed to investigate
the nonlinear development of tearing modes.

The equilibrium magnetic field is written

\[
\mathbf{B}_0=B_{0y}(x)\hat{y}
\]

where \(B_{0y}(-x)=-B_{0y}(x)\). There is assumed to be non-equilibrium
plasma flow. The linearized equations of resistive-MHD, assuming
incompressible flow, take the form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:linear_induction_B}{}{
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=\nabla\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)+\frac{\eta}{\mu_0}\nabla^2\mathbf{B}
}\label{eq:linear_induction_B}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:linear_moment}{}{
\rho_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t}=-\nabla p +\frac{(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B}_0}{\mu_0}+\frac{(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_0)\times\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0}
}\label{eq:linear_moment}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:linear_divB}{}{
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0
}\label{eq:linear_divB}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:linear_divV}{}{
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}=0
}\label{eq:linear_divV}\end{equation}

Here, \(\rho_0\) is the equilibrium plasma density, \(\mathbf{B}\) is
the perturbed magnetic field, \(\mathbf{v}\) the perturbed plasma
velocity, and \(p\) the perturbed plasma pressure. The assumption of
incompressible plasma flow is valid provided that the plasma velocity
associated with the instability remains significantly smaller than both
the Alfvén velocity and the sonic velocity.

Suppose that all perturbed quantities vary like

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:linear_tearing_pert}{}{
A(x,y,z,t)=A(x)e^{iky+\gamma t}
}\label{eq:linear_tearing_pert}\end{equation}

where \(\gamma\) is the instability growth rate. The \(x\)-component of
Equation~\ref{eq:linear_induction_B} and the \(z\)-component of the curl
of Equation~\ref{eq:linear_moment} reduce to ???

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:pert_induction_B}{}{
\gamma B_x = ikB_{0y}v_x + \frac{\eta}{\mu_0}\Big( \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2\Big)B_x
}\label{eq:pert_induction_B}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:pert_momentum}{}{
\gamma \rho_0 \Big( \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2 \Big)v_x=\frac{ikB_{0y}}{\mu_0}\Big( \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}-k^2-\frac{B_{0y}^{\prime\prime}}{B_{0y}}\Big)B_x
}\label{eq:pert_momentum}\end{equation}

respectively, where use has been made of Equation~\ref{eq:linear_divB}
and Equation~\ref{eq:linear_divV}. Here, \(\prime\) denotes
\(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}x\).

It is convenient to normalize Equation~\ref{eq:pert_induction_B} and
Equation~\ref{eq:pert_momentum} using a typical magnetic field-strength,
\(B_0\), and a typical scale-length, \(a\). Let us define the
\emph{Alfvén time-scale}

\[
\tau_A=\frac{a}{V_A}
\]

where \(V_A=B_0/\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho_0}\) is the Alfvén velocity, and the
resistive diffusion time-scale

\[
\tau_R=\frac{\mu_0 a^2}{\eta}
\]

The ratio of these two time-scale is the \emph{Lundquist number}:

\[
S=\frac{\tau_R}{\tau_A}
\]

Let \(\psi= B_x/B_0\), \(\phi = i\,k\,V_y/\gamma\), \(\bar{x}=x/a\),
\(F=B_{0y}/B_0\), \(F'\equiv dF/\mathrm{d}\bar{x}\),
\(\bar{\gamma} = \gamma\,\tau_A\), and \(\bar{k} = k\,a\). It follows
that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_B}{}{
\bar{\gamma}\,(\psi-F\,\phi) = S^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2}-\bar{k}^2\right) \psi
}\label{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_B}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum}{}{
\bar{\gamma}^2\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2} -\bar{k}^2\right)\phi = -\bar{k}^2\, F \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2} -\bar{k}^2 - \frac{F''}{F}\right) \psi
}\label{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum}\end{equation}

The term on the right-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_B} represents plasma
resistivty, whilst the term on the left-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum} represents plasma inertia.

It is assumed that \emph{the tearing instability grows on a hybrid
time-scale which is much less than \(\tau_R\) but much greater than
\(\tau_A\)}. It follows that

\[
\begin{aligned}
\tau_A \ll \gamma^{-1} \ll \tau_R \\
\gamma\tau_A \ll 1 \ll \gamma\tau_R \\
\bar{\gamma} \ll 1 \ll S\,\bar{\gamma}
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, throughout most of the plasma we can neglect the right-hand side
of Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_B} and the left-hand
side of Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum}, which is
equivalent to the neglect of plasma resistivity and inertia. In this
case, the two equations reduce to

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_ideal}{}{
\phi = \frac{\psi}{F}
}\label{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_ideal}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum_ideal}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\psi}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2} - \bar{k}^2\psi - \frac{F''}{F}\psi = 0
}\label{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum_ideal}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_ideal} is simply the flux
freezing constraint, which requires the plasma to move with the magnetic
field. Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum_ideal} is the
linearized, static force balance criterion
\(\nabla\times(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B})=0\). These two equations are
known collectively as the equations of ideal-MHD, and are valid
throughout virtually the whole plasma. However, it is clear that these
equations \emph{break down} in the immediate vicinity of the interface,
where \(F=0\) (i.e.~where the magnetic field reverses direction).
Witness, for instance, the fact that the normalized ``radial'' velocity,
\(\phi\), becomes infinite as \(F\rightarrow 0\), according to
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_ideal}.

The ideal-MHD equations break down close to the interface because the
neglect of plasma resistivity and inertia becomes untenable as
\(F\rightarrow 0\). Thus, there is a thin layer, in the immediate
vicinity of the interface, \(\bar{x}=0\), where the behaviour of the
plasma is governed by the full MHD equations,
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_B} and
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum}. We can simplify these
equations, making use of the fact that \(\bar{x}\ll 1\) and
\(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}\bar{x} \gg 1\) in a thin layer, to obtain the
following layer equations:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tearing_layer_induction}{}{
\bar{\gamma}\,(\psi - \bar{x}\,\phi) = S^{-1}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\psi}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2}
}\label{eq:tearing_layer_induction}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:tearing_layer_momentum}{}{
\bar{\gamma}^2\,\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\phi}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2} = - \bar{x}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\psi}{\mathrm{d}\bar{x}^2}
}\label{eq:tearing_layer_momentum}\end{equation}

Note that we have redefined the variables \(\phi\), \(\bar{\gamma}\),
and \(S\), such that \(\phi\rightarrow F'(0)\,\phi\),
\(\bar{\gamma}\rightarrow \gamma\,\tau_H\), and
\(S\rightarrow \tau_R/\tau_H\). Here,

\[
\tau_H = \frac{\tau_A}{k\,a\,F'(0)}
\]

is the \emph{hydromagnetic time-scale}.

The tearing mode stability problem reduces to solving the non-ideal-MHD
layer equations, Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_layer_induction} and
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_layer_momentum}, in the immediate vicinity of
the interface, \(\bar{x}=0\), solving the ideal-MHD equations,
@Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_induction_ideal} and
Equation~\ref{eq:tearing_normalized_momentum_ideal}, everywhere else in
the plasma, matching the two solutions at the edge of the layer, and
applying physical boundary conditions as
\(\vert\bar{x}\vert\rightarrow\infty\). This method of solution was
first described in a classic paper
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-furth1963finite}{Furth et al., 1963}). The steps
are listed in the
\href{https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasmahtml/node76.html}{farside
note}. The procedure is similar to the 3 layer solution of the K-H
instability. After some maths, tearing mode dispersion relation is given
as

\[
\gamma = \left[\frac{{\Gamma}(1/4)}{2\pi\,{\Gamma}(3/4)}\right]^{4/5}\, \frac{({\Delta}')^{4/5}}{\tau_H^{2/5}\,\tau_R^{3/5}}
\]

where

The tearing mode is unstable whenever \({\Delta}'>0\), and grows on the
hybrid time-scale \(\tau_H^{2/5}\,\tau_R^{3/5}\).

\hypertarget{sec:reconnection}{%
\section{Magnetic Reconnection}\label{sec:reconnection}}

There are several key elements for understanding the physics of
reconnection at a deeper level
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ji2022magnetic}{Ji et al., 2022}). First, the
frozen-in properties in an electron-ion plasma are associated with the
electron fluid due to its light weight. This is expressed in terms of
the time changing rate of magnetic flux
(Equation~\ref{eq:magnetic_flux}) through an arbitrary area,
\(\mathbf{S}\) (enclosed by loop \(l\)), convecting with the electron
flow as
\(\mathrm{d}\Phi/\mathrm{d}t = \oint(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}_e\times\mathbf{B})\cdot\mathrm{d}l = 0\).
Thus, the frozen-in condition is regulated by the electron momentum
equation (i.e.~the generalized Ohm's law)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ohms_law_reconnection}{}{
\underbrace{\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{V}_e\times\mathbf{B}}_{\text{Ideal}} = \underbrace{\mathbf{R}_\text{col}}_{\text{Collisional}} - \underbrace{\frac{\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}_e}{en} - \frac{m_e}{e}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_e}{\mathrm{d}t}}_{\text{Kinetic}}
}\label{eq:ohms_law_reconnection}\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{R}_\text{col}\) is the collisional force per electron
charge. In a fully ionized collisional plasma,
\(\mathbf{R}_\text{col}\approx \eta\mathbf{j}\) where \(\eta\) is the
resistivity due to Coulomb collisions. If the terms on the right-hand
side of Equation~\ref{eq:ohms_law_reconnection} are negligible, then
\(\mathrm{d}\Phi/\mathrm{d}t \approx 0\) and the magnetic flux is
``frozen-in'' to the electron flow. For the generic reconnection layer
illustrated in the middle panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:reconnection_configurations}, deviations from ideal
evolution occur within the ``diffusion region'' (blue), where either
finite resistivity or kinetic effects (electron inertia and pressure
tensor) are important. Within the diffusion region, field lines
converging from opposite sides of the layer can change connectivity.

}
\end{figure}

The next key element for understanding the physics of magnetic
reconnection is to grasp the remarkable global consequences of changing
field line connectivity within a localized region. In particular, the
newly reconnected field lines have a large curvature
\(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{B}\) which produces a tension force ---
closely analogous to a stretched rubber band. Allowing for the
possibility of pressure anisotropy, the MHD momentum equation
perpendicular to magnetic field is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_force_perp_anisotropic}{}{
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_\perp}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla_\perp\left( p_\perp + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\right) + \left( 1+\frac{p_\perp - p_\parallel}{B^2/\mu_0}\right)\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{F}_{\text{col}\perp}
}\label{eq:mhd_force_perp_anisotropic}\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{F}_\text{col}\) is due to collisions between ions
(viscous force) and between ions and neutral particles (frictional
force). For newly reconnected field lines, the magnetic tension in
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_force_perp_anisotropic} drives an outflow jet
approaching the Alfvén speed
\(V_\text{out} \approx V_A \equiv B_0/\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho}\) (\(B_0\) is
the reconnecting field component). The resulting deficit in magnetic
pressure pushes new field lines into the diffusion region with a maximum
inflow velocity \(V_\text{in}\sim (0.01 \rightarrow 0.1) V_A\). As this
process continues, the larger stressed region is relaxed, leading to a
reconfiguration of the global magnetic field on fast Alfvénic time
scales \(\sim L/V_A\). Assuming the diffusion regions remain small in
comparison to the global scales, most plasma enters the flow jet across
the magnetic separatrices as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:reconnection_configurations}. This inflow is a
consequence of changing the field line connectivity within the diffusion
region, which causes the entire extent of the reconnected field lines to
join the outflow. In this limit, the majority of the energy release is
associated with the relaxation of field-line tension within outflow jets
over long distances. Since the spatial extent of these jets is limited
only by the macroscopic configuration, they are one of the most
prominent signatures of reconnection in both in-situ and remote-sensing
observations. Our primary focus is on situations where the available
magnetic energy to drive reconnection is comparable or larger than the
initial plasma thermal energy, corresponding to
\(\beta\equiv p/(B_0^2/2\mu_0)\lesssim 1\). In these regimes, global
relaxation of field-line tension is the ultimate ``engine'' for
reconnection and is essentially ``ideal'', thus operating in a similar
manner for most applications, but with a few important exceptions.
Plasma heating preferentially along the magnetic field
(\(p_\parallel\gg p_\perp\)) can weaken the magnetic tension force in
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_force_perp_anisotropic}, whereas in partially
ionized regimes the jet formation is more complicated due to
interactions with neutrals. In addition, non-ideal kinetic physics may
persist along magnetic separatrices (see red lines in
Figure~\ref{fig:reconnection_configurations}) to larger distances, while
in very large systems shocks may form along these boundaries and play a
role in the energy conversion.

In contrast to the ideal physics driving the jet, the non-ideal terms
within the diffusion region are intimately dependent upon the plasma
conditions and spatial scales, and thus, a variety of different regimes
are possible, as illustrated in the various panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:reconnection_configurations}. Since the outflow is
always energetically limited to \(V_A\) in a quasi-steady state, mass
conservation implies that the geometry of the diffusion region
determines the dimensionless reconnection rate,
\(R \equiv V_\text{in}/V_A \approx \Delta/L\) where \(\Delta\) is the
diffusion region thickness. The current understanding of the diffusion
region physics has evolved over more than 60 years in three main stages,
yet a full understanding remains elusive for large space and
astrophysical problems.

\hypertarget{hall-field}{%
\subsection{Hall Field}\label{hall-field}}

Let X be the inflow direction, Z the outflow direction, and Y the
out-of-plane direction. During magnetic reconnection,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a quadrupolar out-of-plane or \emph{Hall} magnetic field \(B_y\) is
  formed by the field aligned currents \(j_\parallel\) that flow in the
  vicinity of the magnetic separatrices when ion and electrons decouple
  on the length scales less than the ion inertial length
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-sonnerup1979space}{Sonnerup, 1979}). The
  quadruple Hall magnetic field was analyzed as a tearing mode eigenmode
  of the current layer (Terasawa 1983). The Hall effect introduces a
  coupling between the tearing mode perturbations (2D configuration
  in-plane \(\mathbf{B}\) components) and shear Alfvén mode
  perturbations (out-of-plane \(\mathbf{B}\) component).
\item
  In the context of collisionless plasmas, ion-electron collisions are
  absent so that ions and electrons behave differently at micro-scale.
  On the ion scale, ions start to become demagnetized whereas electrons
  are still coupled to the magnetic field. The difference in the ion and
  electron motion produces \emph{charge separation}, \emph{Hall electric
  fields} and the \emph{associated electric current}. (On the even
  smaller electron-scale, electrons are demagnetized and correspond to
  the ``breaking'' of the field line.) The spatial variation of Hall
  electric fields is mostly in X, normal to and pointing towards the
  current layer. Relevance of Hall effects in reconnection is considered
  important at the ion inertial scale, providing a source for non-ideal
  reconnection electric field. (In observations, the perpendicular scale
  of the Hall fields and current layer can be as small as electron
  scales as well?) The parallel scale of the Hall fields are much
  larger. Equivalently, Hall fields are associated with a wave vector
  \(\mathbf{k}\) so that \(k_x\gg k_z\) and \(1/k_x\) on the ion-scale.
\end{itemize}

The Hall fields are continuously produced quasi-steady structures
accompanied with a timescale much longer than the ion gyroperiod. Their
associated kinetic and magnetic energies propagate away from the
reconnection layers carried by Alfvén waves. Numerical simulations
suggest that it is primarily kinetic Alfvén waves (KAW,
Section~\ref{sec:kaw}) which are excited in the vicinity of reconnection
regions (Rogers+, 2001; Shay+, 2011), but further downstream in the
exhaust it is primarily shear Alfvén waves
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gurram2021shear}{Gurram et al., 2021}).

In observations, signatures of Hall magnetic fields are used as a
working definition of collisionless magnetic reconnection in the Earth's
and planetary magnetosphere.

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dai2023kinetic}{Dai \& Wang, 2023}) emphasized
that the physics underlying the Hall effect is similar to that in KAW:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Both can be described by the two-fluid equations.
\item
  The temporal and spatial scales of Hall fields are exactly the same as
  those of KAW.
\item
  The polarity of the Hall electric field (in X) and the Hall magnetic
  field (in Y) is also consistent with that of KAW.
\item
  The ratio \(E_x / B_y\) of Hall fields is on the order of \(V_A\),
  similar to KAW.
\item
  The current system of Hall fields are in the XZ-plane.
\end{itemize}

As the perpendicular wavelength of Alfvén wave becomes comparable to the
ion gyroradius, the ions cannot follow the
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift. This is because the wave electric
field now is non-uniform in the trajectory of ion gyromotion. As a
consequence, the ion transverse motion is modified by the
finite-Larmor-radius (FLR) effect. Considering the kinetic correction,
the ion actually follows
\(\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{V}_i\times\mathbf{B} + \frac{1}{n_i q_i}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}_i\)
in the transverse motion. The FLR effect is manifested in the ion
pressure gradient term: the FLR effect is equivalent to a finite
temperature for the ions on the fluid level. At the wavelength of
ion-scale wavelength, electrons cannot follow ions in the transverse
motion. The difference in the transverse motion of ions and electrons
produces a charge separation and coupling to the electrostatic mode, and
a quasi-electrostatic electric field is formed in the transverse
direction. To remain quasi-neutral, electrons quickly move in the
direction parallel to the magnetic field. In the parallel direction,
these electrons undergo a force balance between a small parallel
electric field and the electron pressure gradient in the case of KAW.
The parallel motion of electrons created a field-aligned current (FAC)
that is a distinct nature of Alfvén mode. The FAC induces a wave
magnetic field perpendicular to the DC (background) magnetic field. A
new physical scale length \(r_{iL}\), the ion gyroradius based on the
electron temperature, for the current layer and outflow layer in fast
reconnection. Through the diffusion region near the X-line, intense KAW
turbulence is observed, suggesting that magnetic reconnection is a
\emph{source} of KAW. Thus KAW has been invoked as ingredients for fast
reconnection.

In the direction parallel to the magnetic field (\(\hat{z}\)), \(B_y\)
reverses but \(E_x\) remains its sign. This feature is related to the
\emph{superposition} of two KAW mode waves that propagate in the
opposite direction and outward from the reconnection region. In the
perpendicular direction, the Hall fields appears to exist only for one
wavelength along \(\hat{x}\). This is related to the eigenmode (standing
mode) structure of KAW in the current layer.

In the literature, the Hall electric field is usually considered to
arise from the \(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}/n_e q\) term in the context
of the generalized Ohm's law Equation~\ref{eq:genearlized_ohm_law}. The
Hall term starts to become important at the ion inertial scale,
contributing to the Hall electric field. Interestingly, the
\(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}\) also represents a major force term in the
one-fluid MHD momentum equation. The \(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}\)
force could be important on the large MHD-scale and the argument for the
origin of Hall electric field becomes ambiguous; from the MHD momentum
equation, \(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}\) term is equivalent to the ion
inertial effect, ion pressure effect and the electron pressure effect:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_momentum_JxB}{}{
\rho\frac{{d\mathbf{u}}}{dt}+\nabla\cdot(\overleftrightarrow{P}_i+\overleftrightarrow{P}_e)=\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}
}\label{eq:mhd_momentum_JxB}\end{equation}

which is derived from the sum of the two-fluid momentum equations
multiplied by the mass of each species. The one-fluid MHD momentum
equation Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_momentum_JxB} together with the general
Ohm's law is nearly equivalent (with some extent of reduction?) to the
two-fluid momentum for two species. The Hall electric field is
equivalently described by either set of equations.

From the ion momentum equation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ion_momentum_E}{}{
\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u}_i\times\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{n_i q_i}\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}_i + \frac{m_i}{q_i}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_i}{\mathrm{d}t}
}\label{eq:ion_momentum_E}\end{equation}

The perpendicular component of the non-ideal electric field
\(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u}_i\times\mathbf{B}\) is the Hall electric field
at the ion kinetic scale; as seen on the RHS, two sources of Hall
electric fields are the ion inertial term and the ion pressure gradient.
From the KAW perspective, the Hall electric field is supported by the
ion pressure gradient. In the regime of the temporal and spatial scale
of KAW, the ion inertial term is small and on the order of
\(\mathcal{O}(\omega^2/\Omega_i^2)\).

If the ion inertial term is neglected, Equation~\ref{eq:ion_momentum_E}
becomes

\[
\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u}_i\times\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{n_i q_i}\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}_i
\]

The \(\mathbf{u}_i\times\mathbf{B}\) term is kept since the ion flow may
not be neglected near the X-line.

\hypertarget{kinetic-signatures-of-diffusion-region}{%
\subsection{Kinetic Signatures of Diffusion
Region}\label{kinetic-signatures-of-diffusion-region}}

(The following part is from {[}Kinetic signatures of the region
surrounding the X-line in asymmetric (magnetopause) reconnection{]} and
{[}Fluid and kinetics signatures of reconnection at the dawn tail
magnetopause-Wind observations{]}.)

\emph{Electron diffusion region} (EDR) is defined to be the
electron-scale region surrounding the X-line in which magnetic
connectivity is ultimately broken. Note that this definition is
fundamentally non-local in nature.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  enhanced dissipation {[}e.g., Zenitani+, 2012{]}
\item
  non-gyrotropic particle behavior {[}e.g., Scudder+, 2008; Aunai+,
  2013; Swisdak 2016{]}
\item
  electron distribution functions {[}e.g., Chen+, 2008, Ng+, 2011{]}
\item
  In the two inflow regions, we expect a reduction in total pressure,
  magnetic field \(B_L\) and the plasma density \(n_i\) relative to
  ambient upstream conditions.
\end{enumerate}

Some signatures also exist downstream of the diffusion region and along
the separatrices. In practice people use a complementary approach for
the identification.

Specifically for EDR, it should exhibit a number of properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the violation of the electron frozen-in condition
\item
  non-gyrotropic electron distributions {[}e.g., Scudder+, 2008; Aunai+,
  2013; Swisdak 2016{]}
\item
  enhanced dissipation {[}Zenitani+, 2011{]}
\end{enumerate}

A simple and practical indicator of EDR is the presence of a sunward
pointing \(E_N\) at the midplane (called the ``shoulder'') as this
signature coincides with the region of enhanced dissipation,
non-gyrotropic electrons at midplane, and counterstreaming electron
beams due to electron meandering orbits around the X-line. This EN
signature is straightforward to measure experimentally because it is the
largest component of the electric field at the magnetopause.

The crescent shape distribution is not as localized as the \(E_N\)
shoulder especially for ion.

}
\end{figure}

At the dayside magnetopause, reconnection between magnetosheath and
geomagnetic field lines is expected to produce

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a finite magnetic field component normal to the magnetopause, \(B_N\);
\item
  Alfvénic plasma flow acceleration associated with a rotational
  discontinuity at the magnetopause;
\item
  ion distributions on reconnected field lines consisting of a mixture
  of magnetosheath and magnetosphere populations where the transmitted
  magnetosheath population has a ``D-shaped'' distribution, with a
  low-energy cutoff at the deHoffmann-Teller velocity {[}Cowley,
  1982{]};
\item
  reflected ions in the layers adjacent to the magnetopause;
\item
  opposite streaming along reconnected field lines of outgoing
  magnetospheric electrons and incoming magnetosheath electrons,
  resulting in large parallel electron heat flux;
\item
  an offset between the ion and electron edges at the inner boundary of
  the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) due to a time-of-flight effect
  resulting from the fact that entering magnetosheath electrons have
  much higher parallel speeds than ions while their transverse motions
  are the same.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{d-shape-distribution}{%
\subsection{D-shape Distribution}\label{d-shape-distribution}}

The kinetic description of reconnection can also be quantitatively
verified. An important kinetic signature is the ``D-shaped'' ion
distribution. Magnetosheath particles can either be reflected at or
cross the magnetopause. In the deHoffmann-Teller frame of reference in
which the electric field vanishes, only ions traveling toward the
magnetopause will cross the magnetopause. Thus, when viewed in the
spacecraft frame, only magnetosheath ions with parallel velocity greater
than the deHoffmann-Teller velocity can be seen earthward of the
magnetopause, resulting in a ``D-shaped'' distribution. {[}Cowley,
1982{]}

The existence of a finite BN at the MP requires field lines on both
sides of the MP to move together. In this scenario there must be a
reference frame (the HT frame) which slides along the MP with the
field-line velocity. In this frame, the convective electric field
vanishes (\(\mathbf{E}_c= -\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}= 0\)), i.e.~the
flows are field aligned on the two sides of the MP.

In practice, the HT frame for a set of plasma and field measurements
across the MP can be found as the reference frame in which the mean
square of the convective electric field,
\(D=\left<|(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{V}_{HT})\times\mathbf{B}|^2\right>\), is
as small as possible. The angle bracket \(<...>\) denotes an average of
an enclosed quantity over a set of measurements. The velocity
\(\mathbf{v}\) for which \(D(\mathbf{v})\) is a minimum is the
deHoffmann-Teller velocity, \(\mathbf{V}_{HT}\). The ratio \(D/D_0\),
where \(D_0=\left<|(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}^|2\right>\), is used as a
measure of the quality of the HT frame. For a good HT frame \(D/D_0\)
should be small (\(\ll 1\)).

In another paper {[}Characteristics of the flank magnetopause: Cluster
observations{]}, \(\mathbf{V}_{HT}\) is defined by minimizing
\(\mathbf{E}^\prime = \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{V}_{HT}\times\mathbf{B}\),
and the correlation between \(\mathbf{E}_c=-\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\)
and \(\mathbf{E}_{HT}=-\mathbf{V}_{HT}\times\mathbf{B}\) describes how
well the frame is determined.

\hypertarget{classification-of-discontinuity-types}{%
\subsection{Classification of Discontinuity
Types}\label{classification-of-discontinuity-types}}

In a fluid description, the magnetopause can be described either as a
tangential discontinuity (TD) or as a rotational discontinuity (RD). A
TD implies a complete separation of two plasma regimes (in this case the
magnetosheath on one side and the magnetosphere on the other side). The
boundary as a whole may move, but there is no transport of plasma across
the discontinuity, and there is no magnetic field along the boundary
normal. An RD-like magnetopause, on the other hand, implies transport
across the boundary and a normal magnetic field, and indicates the
presence of reconnection. In the vicinity of the X-line, the plasma flow
is Alfvénic, i.e., the Walén relation is satisfied:

\[
\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{V}_{HT} = \pm\mathbf{V}_A
\]

where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the plasma velocity, \(\mathbf{V}_{HT}\) is the
deHoffmann-Teller frame velocity, and \(\mathbf{V}_A\) is the local
Alfvén velocity.

In some other literature, a more complete form is written as

\[
\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{V}_{HT} = \pm(1-\alpha)^{1/2}\mathbf{V}_A
\]

which takes the pressure anisotropy factor
\(\alpha=(p_\parallel - p_\perp)\mu_0 / B^2\) into account.

This is often used to classify the discontinuity type of the
magnetopause. For an RD, the flow across the boundary is proportional to
the normal magnetic field, i.e., \(v_n \propto B_n\). A positive
(negative) slope of the regression means that normal magnetic field and
flow have the same (opposite) signs. At the magnetopause, we can assume
that the flow is inward, i.e., from the magnetosheath into the
magnetosphere.

\hypertarget{reconnection-efficiency}{%
\subsection{Reconnection Efficiency}\label{reconnection-efficiency}}

This is very confusing. From {[}Kivelson+ 1997{]}:

\begin{quote}
There is an interesting link between flow speeds over the polar cap and
reconnection efficiency at the nose of its magnetopause. This follows
from the fact that the voltage drop across the magnetosphere is a
fraction of the voltage drop across the same distance in the corotating
flow upstream. Thus, the convection electric field within the
magnetosphere is a fraction of the corotation electric field determined
by the efficiency of reconnection. The model allows us to estimate the
convective flow speeds of plasma over the polar cap if the reconnection
efficiency is known, and conversely allows us to estimate the
reconnection efficiency if the flow speed over the polar cap is known.
\end{quote}

Let me think in this way: the convective electric field in the upstream,
\(\mathbf{E}=-\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\), describes how many magnetic
field lines are moving into the reconnection site at a given point. The
integral of electric field along the X-line describes how many magnetic
field lines are getting reconnected into the magnetosphere. This is not
the same as electric potential drop, where in the simplest cases
requires a static EM field. Because of the difficulty of finding the
separatrices, we use an indirect approach assuming equi-potential field
lines to calculate the electric field along the magnetosphere boundary
curve away from the reconnection site.

Be careful for the word ``cross polar cap potential'' here. This may be
a misleading term, since how can one define an electric potential in a
EM field?

\hypertarget{dissipation-mechanisms}{%
\subsection{Dissipation Mechanisms}\label{dissipation-mechanisms}}

Perhaps the most import problem associated with reconnection is the
understanding of the mechanisms by which the magnetic field can
dissipate its energy, and subsequently produce particle heating and
acceleration {[}Huba 1979{]}. Since many field reversed plasmas are
essentially collisionless, instabilities are likely to play an important
role in the dissipation process.

A macro-instability (MHD type), like the tearing mode can dissipate
magnetic energy even in a collisionless plasma via electron inertia,
electron or ion Landau damping. However, the collisionless tearing mode
saturates at a very small amplitude. Micro-instabilities can also
dissipate magnetic energy by producing an anomalous resistivity which
can either dissipate the magnetic energy directly or enhance the growth
of the tearing mode.

In any case, the kinetic physics corresponding to the fast rate of
collisionless reconnection is a long-standing question.
\emph{Non-gyrotropy particle distributions} and the associated
\emph{off-diagonal term of the pressure tensor} have been considered to
provide the reconnection electric field at electron-scale and ion-scale.

The \emph{lower-hybrid-drift instability} (LHDI, Section~\ref{sec:LHDI})
is often considered to be an important microinstability for dissipation
near the diffusion region.

\hypertarget{sweet-parker-solution}{%
\subsection{Sweet-Parker Solution}\label{sweet-parker-solution}}

From Yi-Hsin Liu's presentation of space weather.

mass conservation:

\[
\nabla\cdot(n\mathbf{V})=0 \Rightarrow\ V_{in}L \simeq V_{out}\delta
\]

momentum conservation:

\[
\frac{\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{B}}{4\pi} = nm_i \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{V} \Rightarrow V_{out}\simeq \frac{B}{\sqrt{4\pi nm_i}} = V_A
\]

normalized reconnection rate

\[
R\equiv\frac{V_{in}}{V_A}\sim\frac{\delta}{L}
\]

However, this model has a small \(\delta/L\), the rate is too small to
explain the time-scales in solar flare. To explain the flares, it
requires \(R\sim 0.1\).

\hypertarget{petschek-solution}{%
\subsection{Petschek Solution}\label{petschek-solution}}

Reconnection in this model is much larger because \(R\sim \delta/L\)
goes up. However, this is not a self-consistent solution.

In PIC simulations, the diffusion region is localized like the Petschek
solution. The reason we use PIC instead of MHD is that PIC captures the
key physics that breaks the frozen-in condition in nature. In the GEM
challenge study, PIC, hybrid, Hall-MHD, MHD with a localized artificial
resistivity all give similar \(R\sim 0.1\) fast reconnection rate in
disparate systems. In terms of the pressure descriptions from the moment
equations, it has been found that 6-moment cannot trigger fast
reconnection while 10-moment can, which essentially indicates that the
off-diagonal terms in the pressure tensor is critical in getting the
right physics.

One possible explanation for this \(0.1\) rate comes from geometrical
consideration. In the small \(\delta/L\) limit, \(R\sim\delta/L\sim0\).
In the large \(\delta/L\) limit, \(\delta/L\rightarrow 1\),
\(R\rightarrow0\). It turns out that there should be an optimized
\(R_{\text{max}}\) in between. In the large \(\delta/L\) limit,

\[
\frac{\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{B}}{4\pi}\simeq \frac{\nabla(B^2)}{8\pi} + nm_i\mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{V}
\]

At the inflow region, the large angle decrease the reconecting magnetic
field. At the outlfow region, it decrease the outflow speed. Both of
them cause \(R\) to decrease. Constraints imposed at the inflow and
outflow region (upper) bound the rate! In {[}Liu+, PRL 2017{]}, an
analytical expression of \(R\) is given by

\[
R\equiv\frac{V_{in}}{V_A}\simeq \frac{\delta}{L}\cdot \underbrace{\Big[ \frac{1-(\delta/L)^2}{1+(\delta/L)^2} \Big]}_{\text{reduction of reconnection B}}\cdot \underbrace{\sqrt{1-\Big( \frac{\delta}{L} \Big)^2}}_{\text{reduction of }V_{out}}
\]

Reconnection tends to proceed near the most efficient state with
\(R\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)\). Nicely, the rate is insensitive to
\(\delta/L\) near this state (BECAUSE THE SLOPE IS SMALL???).

Amitava Bhattacharjee argued that scaling is a controversial subject:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How does it scale with ion/electron skin depth, resistivity, plasma
  beta, and system size?
\item
  Is the reconnection rate insensitive to the details of the electron
  layer (current sheet layer), and controlled by ions?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The whistler waves generate an out-of-plane quadrupolar magnetic
  field.
\item
  The ratio of the horizontal electron outflow to the horizontal
  magnetic perturbation scales as \(k\) for the dispersive whistler (or
  kinetic Alfvén) wave. (WHICH WAVE IS IT? I have been confused by the
  relation between whistler waves ann KAWs. Both contains a region with
  super-Alfvénic phase speed for large \(k\) and especially with
  frequency between \(\Omega_i\) and \(\Omega_e\); whister wave involves
  electrons whereas KAW can only rely on ions.)
\end{itemize}

From the GEM Challenge perspective:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reconnection is insensitive to the mechanism that breaks field lines
  (electron inertia or resistivity). The length of the reconnection
  layer \(\Delta_i\sim 10 d_i\). Reconnection rate is a ``universal
  constant'', \(V_in\approx 0.1 V_A\).
\item
  In the presence of Hall currents, whistler waves mediate reconnection.
  The characteristic outflow speed is the whistler phase speed (based on
  the upstream magnetic field).
\item
  The inflow velocity \(v_\text{in}=\Omega_e\delta_e^2/\Delta_i\) where
  \(\Delta_i\sim k^{-1}\ll L\) (system size). This rate is independent
  of \(m_e\).
\end{itemize}

The GEM perspective is not universally accepted. An alternate point of
view provides evidence that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reconnection is not a universal constant, and depends on system
  parameters (such as ion/electron skin depth, plasma beta, boundary
  conditions).
\item
  Reconnection rate is not independent of the system size, and in fact,
  often decreases as the system size increases.
\end{itemize}

He provided three examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Forced reconnection without guide field
\item
  Undriven reconnection with guide field
\item
  Undriven reconnection with open boundaries
\end{enumerate}

How about the freedom coming from the extra dimension?

Distinct 3D features, including

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  flux ropes
\item

\end{itemize}

3D diffusion region can be fundamentally different. For example, you may
find bifurcation of electron diffusion region in 3D reconnection
simulations. Clue: bifurcated layer is located in between these
intertwined flux ropes, and tearing modes give rise to these flux ropes!
2D only allows the parallel tearing mode, i.e., no bifurcation. 3D
allows a spectrum of oblique tearing modes, unlike 2D.

\hypertarget{sec:LHDI}{%
\section{Lower Hybrid Drift Instability}\label{sec:LHDI}}

The \emph{lower-hybrid-drift instability} (LHDI) is a microinstability
which has thought to be an anomalous transport mechanism in both
laboratory and space plasmas. The local linear theory of this
instability is well understood. The mode is driven by the diamagnetic
current produced by pressure inhomogeneities and is characterized at
maximum growth by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\omega\sim kV_d \lesssim \omega_{lh} \\
\gamma\lesssim \omega \\
k \sim \omega_{lh}/v_i \\
\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(V_d\) is the diamagnetic drift velocity, \(\omega_{lh}\) is the
lower hybrid frequency, and \(v_i\) is the ion thermal velocity.

\[
\omega_{lh} = [(\Omega_i \Omega_e)^{-1} + \omega_{pi}^{-2}]^{-1/2}
\]

where \(\Omega_i\) is the ion cyclotron frequency, \(\Omega_e\) is the
electron cyclotron frequency, and \(\omega_{pi}\) is the ion plasma
frequency. It is so called ``hybrid'' because it is a mixture of two
frequencies. It is unusual in that the ion and electron masses play an
equally important role.

The drift velocity is

\[
V_d = \frac{\nabla p\times \mathbf{B}}{neB^2}
\]

Physically, the instability is reactive (fluid-like) in the strong drift
velocity regime (\(V_d > v_i\)) and dissipative (kinetic) in the weak
drift velocity regime (\(V_d < v_i\)).

\section{Pressure Anisotropy
Instabilities}\label{pressure-anisotropy-instabilities}}

When we shift to the MHD with anisotropic pressure tensor

\[
P_{ij} = p_\perp \delta_{ij} + (p_\parallel - p_\perp)B_i B_j / B^2
\]

where \(p_\perp\) and \(p_\parallel\) are the pressures perpendicular
and parallel w.r.t. the magnetic field, respectively. For the strong
magnetic field approximation, the two pressures are related to the
plasma density and the magnetic field strength by two adiabatic
equations,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{p_\parallel B^2}{\rho^3} \Big) &= 0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{p_\perp}{\rho B} \Big) &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

This is also known as the \emph{double adiabatic theory}, which is also
what many people remember to be the key conclusion from the
\href{https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1956.0116}{CGL theory}. Here I want
to emphasize the meaning of \emph{adiabatic} again: this assumes zero
heat flux. If the system is not adiabatic, the conservation of these two
quantities related to the parallel and perpendicular pressure is no
longer valid, and additional terms may come into play such as the
stochastic heating.

Now imagine an increasing magnetic field \(B\). For an initially
Maxwellian distributed plasma like a circle in the phase space, it will
get stretched in the perpendicular direction and become an oval;
conversely, if the magnetic field is decreasing, it will get stretched
in the parallel direction.

\hypertarget{mirror-instability}{%
\subsection{Mirror Instability}\label{mirror-instability}}

\href{https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/notes/LESHOUCHES15/SouthwoodKivelson93_Mirror.pdf}{Southwood
\& Kivelson} had a nice paper explaining the physics of mirror
instability. See also Section~\ref{sec:mirror} for a more thorough
mathematical description of the instability.

The mirror instability is prevalent in planetary and cometary
magnetosheaths and other high \(\beta\) environment. It is recognized as
one of the two magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that occur in the
presence of extreme velocity space (pitch angle) anisotropy in a uniform
plasma, the other instability being the firehose. The mirror mode has
gained increasing interest following its identification in spacecraft
data from the magnetosheath and solar wind. Although the instability was
originally derived from magnetohydrodynamic fluid theory, later work
showed that there were significant differences between the fluid theory
and a more rigorous kinetic approach, as we will see in
Section~\ref{sec:mirror}.

The instability occurs when \(\beta\), the ratio of plasma to magnetic
pressure. The anisotropy \((p_\perp - p_par)/p_par\) required for
instability \(\propto \beta^{-1}\). In planetary magnetosheaths the
source of anisotropy is likely to be the planetary bow shock and in
cometary environments the ion pickup process is a natural source of
anisotropy. Both types of environment tend to have relatively large
values of \(\beta\).

Any nonlinear saturation mechanism of the mirror instability is likely
to leave the plasma spatially structured, as is also strongly suggested
by the many observations. In practice, in almost any experimental
detection of a plasma instability, the wave fields and the plasma
population will have evolved to some quasi-steady condition that
represents a nonlinear saturated state of the instability. In the
spatially structured magnetic field associated with the minor
instability in both its linear and nonlinear phase, different parts of
the ion distribution will resonate with an ion cyclotron wave as the
wave propagates along the inhomogeneous field. This effect is likely to
inhibit the growth of the ion cyclotron mode, which theoretically also
exists in the same frequency band.

The mirror instability is referred to as a ``fluid'' instability,
alluding to the fact that the phase space (pitch angle) anisotropy of
the bulk of the hot plasma distribution serves as the source of energy.
The instability grows because of a subtle coupling between a group of
particles with small velocity parallel to the field and the rest of the
population. The mirror instability has zero parallel phase velocity in
the plasma frame of reference. It follows, by analogy with other uses of
the term that we can call particles with near zero parallel velocity
\emph{resonant}.

\end{figure}

(Song+ 1994) presented a set of identification criteria for
distinguishing among various forms of high \(\beta\) MHD waves, with
mirror modes having the properties:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compressional fluctuations:
\end{itemize}

\[
(\delta\mathbf{B}^2 - \delta \mathbf{B}_\parallel^2) / \delta \mathbf{B}_\parallel^2 < 1
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Anti-correlated \(\delta Pi\) and \(\delta P_B\):
\end{itemize}

\[
\delta P_i / \delta P_B < 0
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Linear magnetic field polarization
\item
  Stationary in plasma rest frame (i.e.~zero phase speed):
\end{itemize}

\[
\Big(\delta \mathbf{v}^2 / \mathbf{v}_0^2 \Big) / \Big( \delta \mathbf{B}^2 / \mathbf{B}_0^2 \Big) \approx 0
\]

The last criterion is referred to as the Doppler ratio and is used to
distinguish between slow mode waves (value \(\ge 1\)) and mirror modes
(value near zero).

Note that mirror mode is not really a MHD mode, but from observation in
the Earth's magnetosheath we often see mirror modes on large MHD scales.
However, in the solar wind, mirror mode structures seem to be much
smaller than those observed in the magnetosheath. From
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_mirror_dispersion}, electron physics may be
involved on the electron scales.

It is still an unknown mystery from MMS observation that downstream of
an interplanetary shock, very few mirror modes were observed. This is
surprising, because usually the shock is a source of pressure
anisotropy. Another explained fact is that typically mirror modes are
not observed during fast solar wind (as of 2022).

I still don't see the dispersion relations for these types of
instabilities\ldots{}

\hypertarget{ion-cyclotron-instability}{%
\subsection{Ion Cyclotron Instability}\label{ion-cyclotron-instability}}

There is another instability (besides mirror instability) that occurs at
frequencies below the ion gyrofrequency in the presence of ion pitch
angle anisotropy, the \emph{electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability}
(EMIC). This is a resonant instability in which the energy for the
instability is fed from a subset of the particle population that are in
gyroresonance with the unstable wave.

From Earth's magnetosheath observations, mirror modes dominates even
though the linear dispersion relation predicts a smaller growth rate
compared with EMIC waves. Gary argued in the 1990s that this is because
of a small portion of heavier species (e.g.~helium) that modifies the
growth rate. Local hybrid simulations (e.g.~the example from hybrid VPIC
in ISSS14) supports this. However, researchers have not reached a
consensus on whether ion cyclotron instability suppress mirror
instability or vice versa.

\hypertarget{sec:kmhd}{%
\chapter{Kinetic MHD}\label{sec:kmhd}}

This is taken from the hand-written lecture notes from Prof.~Alexander
Schekochihin. Theoretical physicists love CGS units, but I tend to use
SI units here. In later part of the note, there may be mixed units, so
be careful.

We start by showing how for magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas
(\(\nu_\text{colli} \ll \Omega_s\), \(r_L\ll \lambda_\text{mfp}\), where
\(\lambda_\text{mfp}\) is the mean free path), low-frequency
(\(\omega \ll \Omega_s\)), long-wavelength (\(kr_L\ll 1\)) dynamics can
be decided by a set of equations that look almost like the familiar MHD.
We will see later on that the ways in which they are not MHD will
profoundly affact the dynamics --- indeed we do not fully understand the
full implication of this in high-\(\beta\) plasmas. This is consequently
one of the frontier topics in theoretical plasma astrophysics.

Let us start from first principles. Any plasma that is going to be of
interest to us is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system of
equations:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_boltzmann}{}{
\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla f_s + \frac{q_s}{m_s}\Big[\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} \Big]\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = C(f_s)
}\label{eq:kmhd_boltzmann}\end{equation}

The Maxwell's equation can be simplified based on our assumptions.

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \epsilon_0 \sum_s q_s n_s,\, n_s=\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}f_s
\]

\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}\) is small when \(k^2\lambda_{De}\ll 1\), and
this simply gives the quasineutrality condition.

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\times\mathbf{E}
\]

\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{j} + \cancel{\epsilon_0\mu_0 \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}},\, \mathbf{j} = \sum_s n_s q_s \mathbf{u}_s, \mathbf{u}_s = \frac{1}{n_s}\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}\mathbf{v} f_s
\]

The displacement current can be neglected since \(\omega\ll kc\) for low
frequency waves and non-relativistic motions.

Intuitively, we tend to think of the plasma as a fluid (or a multi-fluid
of several species) with some density \(n_s\), velocity \(\mathbf{u}_s\)
and perhaps pressure, temperature, etc. This is rooted in our experience
with collisional gases (\(\nu\gg \omega\)), which are in local
Maxwellian equilibrium:

\[
f_s = \frac{n_s}{(\pi v_{\text{th},s}^2)^{3/2}}e^{-\frac{(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_s)^2}{v_{\text{th},s}^2}},\, v_{\text{th},s} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_B T_s}{m_s}}
\]

where \(n_s, \mathbf{u}_s\) and \(T_s\) are governed by fluid equations.

With this desire to think of plasmas as fluid, let us break the motion
of the particles into two parts:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}_s(t,\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{w}
\]

where \(\mathbf{u}_s\) represents the mean velocity of species \(s\)
(fluid-like description) and \(\mathbf{w}\) represents the ``peculiar''
velocity or internal motion (kinetic description). This amounts to a
transformation of variables

\[
(t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v}) \rightarrow (t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{w}),\quad\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}_s(t,\mathbf{r})
\]

under which the derivatives in the new basis shall be written as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_change_of_var}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&\rightarrow \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_s}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{w}} \\
\nabla&\rightarrow \nabla-(\nabla\mathbf{u}_s)\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{w}} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{v}}&\rightarrow \frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{w}}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:kmhd_change_of_var}\end{equation}

This can be derived from the chain rule with

\[
\begin{aligned}
t^\prime &= t \\
\mathbf{r}^\prime &= \mathbf{r} \\
\mathbf{w} &= \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}_s(t,\mathbf{r})
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that the three variables are independent, for any quantity \(f\),
we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial t^\prime}\cdot\frac{\partial t^\prime}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{r}^\prime}\cdot\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}^\prime}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{w}}\cdot\frac{\partial\mathbf{w}}{\partial t} \\
&= \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_s}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\partial \mathbf{w}}
\end{aligned}
\]

Similarly we can derive the other two relations in
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_change_of_var}. Then the Boltzmann equation
becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:boltzmann_change_of_var}{}{
\Big( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}_s\cdot\nabla\Big)f_s + (\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla)f_s + \Big(\frac{q_s}{m_s}\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{B} +\mathbf{a}_s -\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}_s )\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{w}} = C(f_s)
}\label{eq:boltzmann_change_of_var}\end{equation}

where

\[
\mathbf{a}_s = \frac{q_s}{m_s}\Big(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u}_s\times\mathbf{B} \Big) - \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_s}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

and now we always have \(\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\mathbf{w}f_s = 0\) by
definition. The strategy now is to take moments of
Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann_change_of_var}. The zeroth-order moment
(\(\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\)) gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{df_s}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} + \int (\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla)f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} + \int \Big[... \Big]\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} = 0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\int f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} + \cancel{\nabla\cdot\int \mathbf{w}f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}} - \int (\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}_s)\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} = 0 \\
\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \int f_s \frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{w}}\big(\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}_s \big)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} = 0 \\
\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \int f_s \frac{\partial}{\partial w_j}\big(w_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}u_{sj} \big)dw_j = 0 \\
\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \int f_s \delta_{ij}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}u_{sj}dw_j + \int f_s  w_i \cancel{\frac{\partial^2 u_{sj}}{\partial x_i \partial w_j}}dw_j = 0 \\
\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \int f_s \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}u_{si}dw_i = 0 \\
\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_s\int f_s \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} = 0 \\
\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_s)n_s = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

or

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_continuity}{}{
\frac{\partial n_s}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(n_s\mathbf{u}_s) = 0
}\label{eq:kmhd_continuity}\end{equation}

The first-order moment (\(\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_s\mathbf{w}\))
gives

\[
\nabla\cdot\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_s\mathbf{w} \mathbf{w}f_s - m_sn_s\mathbf{a}_s = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_s\mathbf{w}C(f_s) \equiv \mathbf{R}_s
\]

where
\(\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_s\mathbf{w} \mathbf{w}f_s = \mathbf{P}_s\)
is the pressure tensor and \(\mathbf{R}_s\) is the collisional friction.
Unpacking \(\mathbf{a}_s\), we have the momentum equation for each
species \(s\)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_momentum_species}{}{
m_sn_s\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_s}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}_s + q_s n_s(\mathbf{E} +\mathbf{u}_s\times\mathbf{B}) + \mathbf{R}_s
}\label{eq:kmhd_momentum_species}\end{equation}

Summing over all the species,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_s m_sn_s\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_s}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla\cdot\sum_s\mathbf{P}_s + \cancel{\sum_s q_s n_s\mathbf{E}} + \sum_s q_s n_s\mathbf{u}_s\times\mathbf{B} + \cancel{\sum_s\mathbf{R}_s} \\
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B} \\
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P} + \mu_0^{-1}(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B} \\
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla\cdot\Big[\mathbf{P} + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}\Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

It is useful to emphasize that
\(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}t = \partial/\partial t + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\).
Later we will see the notation of \(D/Dt\), which is used to remind us
of the fact that \(\mathbf{w}\) is involved.

We also need an equation for the magnetic field. It is Faraday's law:

\[
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\times\mathbf{E}
\]

From Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_species},

\[
\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{u}_s\times\mathbf{B} + \frac{\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}_s}{q_sn_s} - \frac{\mathbf{R}_s}{q_sn_s} + \frac{m_s}{q_s}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_s}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]

Based on the following arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P}_s/(q_sn_s)\) is small since
  \(kr_s/M_A \ll 1\)(long wave + incompressible plasma???),
\item
  \(\mathbf{R}_s/(q_sn_s)\) is small since \(\nu_s/\Omega_s\ll 1\),
\item
  \((m_s/q_s) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_s/\mathrm{d}t\) is small since
  \(\omega/\Omega_s\ll 1\)
\end{itemize}

we have the simplest Ohm's law and in turn
\(\mathbf{u}_s = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}/B^2 = \mathbf{u}_\perp\),
the perpendicular component of the velocity is the same for all species.
Then we get the induction equation from Faraday's law:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_induction}{}{
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B})
}\label{eq:kmhd_induction}\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_induction2}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{B}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}
}\label{eq:kmhd_induction2}\end{equation}

The three equations we have so far are very similar to MHD, except for
the pressure tensor. Obviously, all the kinetic magic is hidden in
\(\mathbf{P}\).

Going back to Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann_change_of_var}, it is key to
notice that

\[
\frac{q_s}{m_s}\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{B}\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{w}} = -\Omega_s\Big( \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{\theta}}\Big)_{w_\perp,w_\parallel}
\]

where \(\theta\) is the gyroangle in the perpendicular plane. This can
be proved by changing to cylindrical coordinates

\[
\mathbf{w} = (w_\perp\cos\theta, w_\perp\sin\theta, w_\parallel)
\]

with changing of variables:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_cylindrical_vspace}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \theta} &= \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 1}}\frac{\partial w_{\perp 1}}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 1}}\frac{\partial w_{\perp 1}}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\parallel}}\cancel{\frac{\partial w_{\parallel}}{\partial \theta}} \\
&= \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 1}}\frac{\partial w_\perp \cos\theta}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 2}}\frac{\partial w_\perp \sin\theta}{\partial \theta} \\
&= -\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 1}}w_\perp \sin\theta + \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 2}}w_\perp \cos\theta \\
&= -w_{\perp 2}\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 1}} + w_{\perp 1}\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_{\perp 2}} \\
&= \mathbf{w}\times\hat{b}\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \mathbf{w}}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:kmhd_cylindrical_vspace}\end{equation}

This is why we say the third term in Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_boltzmann}
represents a rotation in the velocity space, or more exactly, in the
perpendicular velocity plane.

From Equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann_change_of_var}, if we apply the lowest
order of approximation,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_kinetic}{}{
\Omega_s\Big( \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{\theta}}\Big)_{w_\perp,w_\parallel} = \underbrace{\frac{\mathrm{d} f_s}{\mathrm{d}t}}_{\substack{\omega/\Omega_s\ll 1 \\ kr_su_s/v_{th,s}\ll 1}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla f_s}_{kr_s\ll 1} + (\underbrace{\mathbf{a}_s}_{kr_s\ll 1} - \underbrace{\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}_s}_{kr_sM_A\ll 1})\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \mathbf{w}} - \underbrace{C(f_s)}_{\nu_s\ll\Omega_s} = 0
}\label{eq:kmhd_kinetic}\end{equation}

which essentially tells us that
\(f_s=f_s(w_\perp,w_\parallel,\theta) = f_s(w_\perp,w_\parallel)\) is
gyrotropic. Let us use \(<>\) to denote averaging over a gyroperiod:

\[
\left< A \right> = \int_0^{2\pi} A \mathrm{d}\theta
\]

We can use gyrotropy to simplify the pressure tensor:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}_s &= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_s\left< \mathbf{w}\mathbf{w} \right>f_s(\mathbf{r},w_\perp,w_\parallel,t) \\
&= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_s \big[\frac{w_\perp^2}{2}(\mathbf{I} - \hat{b}\hat{b}) + w_\parallel^2\hat{b}\hat{b} \big] f_s(\mathbf{r},w_\perp,w_\parallel,t) \\
&= (\mathbf{I} - \hat{b}\hat{b})\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}f_s + \hat{b}\hat{b}\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_sw_\parallel^2 f_s \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} p_{\perp s} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & p_{\perp s} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & p_{\parallel s} \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\]

where

\[
\begin{aligned}
p_\perp &= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}f_s \\
p_\parallel &= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_sw_\parallel^2 f_s
\end{aligned}
\]

Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_species} becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_momentum_species_gyrotropic}{}{
\rho\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\nabla\Big( \underbrace{p_\perp + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}}_{\text{total scalar pressure}} \Big) + \nabla\cdot\Big[ \hat{b}\hat{b}\big( \underbrace{p_\perp - p_\parallel}_{\text{pressure anisotropy stress}} + \underbrace{\frac{B^2}{\mu_0}}_{\text{Maxwell stress}} \big) \Big]
}\label{eq:kmhd_momentum_species_gyrotropic}\end{equation}

The pressure anisotropy stress is the key new feature compared to usual
MHD. It should be important provided
\(p_\perp - p_\parallel \gtrsim B^2/\mu_0\), or
\((p_\perp - p_\parallel)/p \gtrsim 2/\beta\). Therefore this is more
likely to matter in high-\(\beta\) plasmas.

To summarize what we have gotten so far: to work out motions and
magnetic fields in a plasma, solve
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_species_gyrotropic} for \(\mathbf{u}\)
and Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_induction} for \(\mathbf{B}\), where

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho &= \sum_s m_s \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}f_s \\
p_\perp &= \sum_s \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}f_s \\
p_\parallel &= \sum_s \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_sw_\parallel^2 f_s
\end{aligned}
\]

We still need the kinetic equation to calculate \(f_s\) --- this kinetic
equation will need to be somewhat reduced to solve for the lowest-order,
gyrotropic \(f_s(w_\perp, w_\parallel)\). In pursuit of instant
justification, we can postpone doing this and first derive some results
that do not need the \(f_s\) equation (i.e.~the Firehose instability) as
in Section~\ref{sec:firehose}. For mirror modes, let us continue from
the kinetic Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_kinetic} for higher orders. We have
already known that the lowest order approximation gives gyrotropic
distributions.

To the first order,

\[
\Omega_s\Big( \frac{\partial f_s^1}{\partial\theta} \Big)_{w_\perp, w_\parallel} = \frac{\mathrm{d} f_s^0}{\mathrm{d}t} + \mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla f_s^0 + ( \mathbf{a}_s -\mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}_s )\cdot\frac{\partial f_s^0}{\partial\mathbf{w}} - C(f_s^0)
\]

The left-hand side can be eliminated by integrating over \(\theta\), so
we have

\[
\left< \frac{\mathrm{d} f_s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla f_s + (\mathbf{a}_s - \mathbf{w}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}_s)\cdot\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial\mathbf{w}} - C(f_s) \right> = 0
\]

where \(f_s = f_s(w_\perp,w_\parallel)\). To do this averaging, we
tranform variables from
\((t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{w}) \rightarrow(t,\mathbf{r},w_\perp,w_\parallel,\theta)\).
With

\[
\begin{aligned}
w_\parallel &= \mathbf{w}\cdot\hat{b}(t,\mathbf{r}) \\
w_\perp &= |\mathbf{w} - w_\parallel\hat{b}|
\end{aligned}
\]

and some algebras (??? Check online notes.), we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_boltzmann_1storder}{}{
\frac{D f_s}{Dt} + \frac{1}{B}\frac{D B}{Dt}\frac{w_\perp}{2}\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_\perp} + \Big( \frac{q_s}{m_s}E_\parallel - \frac{D\mathbf{u}_s}{Dt}\cdot\hat{b} - \frac{w_\perp^2}{2}\frac{\nabla_\parallel B}{B} \Big)\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial w_\parallel} = C(f_s)
}\label{eq:kmhd_boltzmann_1storder}\end{equation}

where

\[
D/Dt = \mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}t + w_\parallel \hat{b}\cdot\nabla = \partial/\partial t + \mathbf{u}_s\cdot\nabla + w_\parallel \hat{b}\cdot\nabla
\]

This is not terribly transparent and it is perhaps better to write this
equation in different, ``more physical'' variables. Let

\[
f_s(w_\perp, w_\parallel) = F_s(\mu, \epsilon)
\]

where \(\mu = m_sw_\perp^2/2B\) is the magnetic moment of a gyrating
particle and \(\epsilon=m_sw^2/2 = m_s(w_\perp^2+w_\parallel^2)/2\).
Since \(\mu\) is conserved when \(\omega\ll\Omega_s\), \(F_s\) satisfies
(???)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_kinetic_1storder}{}{
\frac{D F_s}{Dt} + \Big[ m_sw_\parallel\Big( \frac{q_s}{m_s}E_\parallel - \frac{D\mathbf{u}_s}{Dt}\cdot\hat{b} \Big) +\mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} \Big]\frac{\partial F_s}{\partial\epsilon} = C(F_s)
}\label{eq:kmhd_kinetic_1storder}\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first term is the convective derivative in the guiding center
  coordinates.
\item
  The second term is the acceleration by parallel electric field, where
  \(E_\parallel\) is determined by imposing \(\sum_s q_s n_s = 0\).
\item
  The third term takes account of the fact that \(\epsilon\) does not
  include the bulk velocity.
\item
  The fourth term is the \emph{betatron acceleration} due to \(\mu\)
  conservation:
\end{itemize}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon &= \mu B + \frac{m_sw_\parallel^2}{2} \\
\dot{\epsilon} &= \mu \dot{B}\,(w_\parallel\text{ constant???})
\end{aligned}
\]

Betatron acceleration refers to situations in which the magnetic field
strength increases slowly in time (compared with a gyroperiod), so that
\(\mu\) remains constant, but the particle kinetic energy is not
constant due to the presence of electric fields (associated with the
time-varying magnetic field). Then, the perpendicular energy is
increased due to constancy of \(\mu\). As we will see soon in
Section~\ref{sec:mirror}, this is the key for explaining mirror modes.

\hypertarget{sec:firehose}{%
\section{Firehose Instability: Linear Theory}\label{sec:firehose}}

Suppose we have some ``macroscopic'' solution of our (yet to be fully
derived) equilibrium. We allow low-frequency, short-wavelength
perturbations (\(\omega\ll u/l, kl \gg 1\)) of this solution, and seek
solutions in the form \(\mathbf{X} +\delta\mathbf{X}\) with
infinitesimal perturbations
\(\propto e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)}\). Note that the
velocity \(\mathbf{u}\) is treated as a perturbation term (background
velocity is simply a drift).

From Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_induction}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_induction_perturb}{}{
\begin{aligned}
-\omega\delta\mathbf{B} &= \mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{k}\delta\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{k}\cdot\delta\mathbf{u} \\
&= B(k_\parallel\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp - \hat{b}\mathbf{k}_\perp\cdot\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:kmhd_induction_perturb}\end{equation}

Inserting Equation~\ref{eq:perturb_k_bhat} into
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_species_gyrotropic}, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb}{}{
\begin{aligned}
-\omega\rho\delta\mathbf{u} &= -\mathbf{k}\Big(\delta p_\perp + \frac{B\delta B}{\mu_0}\Big) + \mathbf{k}\cdot\Big[ \Big(\delta\hat{b}\hat{b} + \hat{b}\delta\hat{b}\Big)\Big( p_\perp - p_\parallel + \frac{B^2}{\mu_0} \Big) +\hat{b}\hat{b}\Big( \delta p_\perp - \delta p_\parallel + \frac{2B\delta B}{\mu_0} \Big) \Big] \\
&= -\mathbf{k}_\perp \Big(\delta p_\perp + \frac{B\delta B}{\mu_0}\Big) - \hat{b}k_\parallel \Big[ \delta p_\parallel + (p_\perp - p_\parallel)\frac{\delta B}{B} \Big] + \delta\hat{b} k_\parallel \Big( p_\perp - p_\parallel + \frac{B^2}{\mu_0} \Big)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb}\end{equation}

\(\delta\hat{b}\) has two parts: the Alfvénic part
\(\delta\mathbf{B}_\perp/B\) and the compressional part
\(\delta\mathbf{B}_\parallel/B\). From
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_induction_perturb}, the Alfvénic perturbation of
\(\hat{b}\) can be written as

\[
\delta\hat{b} = \frac{\delta\mathbf{B}_\perp}{B} = -\frac{k_\parallel}{\omega}\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp
\]

Isolate the Alfvénic response in Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb}
by cross-producting with \(\mathbf{k}_\perp\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\omega\rho \mathbf{k}_\perp \times\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp = k_\parallel\Big(p_\perp - p_\parallel +\frac{B^2}{\mu_0} \Big) \mathbf{k}_\perp\times\delta\hat{b} \\
\omega\rho \mathbf{k}_\perp \times\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp = k_\parallel\Big(p_\perp - p_\parallel +\frac{B^2}{\mu_0} \Big) \mathbf{k}_\perp\times\frac{k_\parallel}{\omega}\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp \\
\omega^2 = k_\parallel^2 \Big( \frac{B^2}{\mu_0 \rho} + \frac{p_\perp - p_\parallel}{\rho} \Big) = k_\parallel^2 v_{th\parallel}^2 \Big( \frac{p_\perp - p_\parallel}{p_\parallel} + \frac{2}{\beta_\parallel} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(A = (p_\perp - p_\parallel)/p_\parallel\). The system will be
unstable if \(A<-2/\beta_\parallel\), which leads to a growth rate

\[
\gamma = k_\parallel v_{th\parallel}\sqrt{\bigg\lvert A+\frac{2}{\beta_\parallel}\bigg\rvert}
\]

Thus, negative \(A\) (\(p_\parallel > p_\perp\)) locally weakens
tention, i.e.~slows down Alfvén waves, and makes it energetically easier
to bend the field lines. For \(A<-2/\beta_\parallel\), the elasticity of
field lines is lost and we have the firehose instability.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:firehose}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/instability_firehose.png}
\caption{Along a flux tube, \(p_\parallel\) is the destabilizing force,
the curvature force is the stabilizing force.}\label{fig:firehose}
}
\end{figure}

Key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Nothing surprising that \(p_\parallel > p_\perp\) leads to an
  instability: it is a non-equilibrium situation, so a source of free
  energy.
\item
  \(\gamma\propto k_\parallel\) leads to UV catastrophe: within KMHD
  (\(\omega\ll\Omega_i, kr_i\ll 1\)), the wavenumber of peak \(gamma\)
  is not captured. Including finite larmor radius gives (Oxford MNRAS
  405, 291? ARE THE EXPRESSIONS CORRECT?)
\end{itemize}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_{\text{peak}}\sim \bigg\lvert A + \frac{2}{\beta_\parallel} \bigg\rvert \Omega_i \\
k_{\parallel\text{peak}}r_i\sim \bigg\lvert A + \frac{2}{\beta_\parallel} \bigg\rvert^{1/2}
\end{aligned}
\]

so the instability is very fast (\(\gamma \propto \Omega_i\) very large
with strong B field) at microscale. Any high-\(\beta\) macroscopic
solution with \(p_\parallel > p_\perp\) will blow up instantly. What
happens next is decided by the nonlinear saturation of the firehose. It
was a transformative moment when Justin Kasper in 2002 discovered that
the firehose stability boundary constrains most observed solar wind
states, followed by Hellinger in 2006. Bale in 2009 showed that there is
an increased fluctuation level at the boundary.

\hypertarget{sec:mirror}{%
\section{Mirror Instability: Linear Theory}\label{sec:mirror}}

Let us go back to Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_induction_perturb} and
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb} and get apart from Alfvénic what
other perturbations there are and when they are stable. We have already
looked at the Alfvénic perturbation
\(\delta\hat{b}=\delta \mathbf{B}_\perp/B\). Now consider

\[
\frac{\delta B}{B} = \frac{\delta B_\parallel}{B}
\]

From Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_induction_perturb}, we have the perpendicular
compression increases B:

\[
\omega\frac{\delta B}{B} = \mathbf{k}_\perp\cdot\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp
\]

Take \(\mathbf{k}_\perp\cdot\) Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb_perp}{}{
\omega\rho\mathbf{k}_\perp\cdot\delta\mathbf{u}_\perp = \rho\omega^2 \frac{\delta B}{B} = k_\perp^2\Big( \delta p_\perp + \frac{B\delta B}{\mu_0} \Big) + k_\parallel^2\Big( p_\perp - p_\parallel + \frac{B^2}{\mu_0} \Big) \frac{\delta B}{B}
}\label{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb_perp}\end{equation}

Note the \(p_\perp\) term here: we need kinetic theory to calculate
this! Fortunately we have Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_kinetic_1storder} ready
for calculating

\[
\delta p_\perp = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}\delta f_s(w_\perp, w_\parallel)
\]

\(\delta f_s(w_\perp, w_\parallel)\) can be obtained by calculating
\(F_s(\mu,\epsilon)\) and transforming back to \(w_\perp,w_\parallel\).

Here is a cute subtlety: our macroscopic equilibrium, around which we
are expanding the distribution is

\[
F_{0s}(\mu,\epsilon) = f_{0s}(w_\perp,w_\parallel) = f_{0s}\Big( \sqrt{\frac{2B_0\mu}{m_s}},\sqrt{\frac{2(\epsilon-\mu B_0)}{m_s}} \Big)
\]

which contains \(B_0\) the unperturbed magnetic field. \(\mu\) in
\(F_0\) contains \(B_0+\delta B\), and this has to be taken into account
when transforming to \(w_\perp,w_\parallel\). Now when we perturb
everything:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_s(\mu,\epsilon) &= F_{0s}(\mu,\epsilon) + \delta F_s \\
&= f_{0s}(w_\perp,w_\parallel) + \delta f_s \\
&= f_{0s}\Big( \sqrt{\frac{2\mu(B_0+\delta B)}{m_s}},\sqrt{\frac{2[\epsilon-\mu(B_0+\delta B)]}{m_s}} \Big) + \delta f_s \\
&= f_{0s}\Big( \sqrt{\frac{2\mu B_0}{m_s}}\sqrt{1+\frac{\delta B}{B_0}},\sqrt{\frac{2(\epsilon-\mu B_0)}{m_s}}\sqrt{1-\frac{m_s\mu\delta B}{(\epsilon-\mu B_0)}} \Big) + \delta f_s \\
&\approx f_{0s}\Big( \sqrt{\frac{2\mu B_0}{m_s}},\sqrt{\frac{2(\epsilon-\mu B_0)}{m_s}} \Big) + \frac{2\mu}{m_s}\delta B\Big(\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\perp^2}-\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2} \Big) + \delta f_s
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus

\[
\delta f_s = \delta F_s - w_\perp^2\frac{\delta B}{B}\Big(\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\perp^2}-\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2} \Big)
\]

If \(f_{0s}\) is a bi-Maxwellian,

\[
f_{0s} = \frac{n_s}{\pi^{3/2}v_{\text{th}\perp s}^2 v_{\text{th}\parallel s}}\exp\Big(-\frac{w_\perp^2}{v_{\text{th}\perp s}^2}-\frac{w_\parallel^2}{v_{\text{th}\parallel s}^2}\Big)
\]

then this can be further written as

\[
\delta f_s = \delta F_s + w_\perp^2\frac{\delta B}{B}\Big(\frac{1}{v_{\text{th}\perp s}^2} - \frac{1}{v_{\text{th}\parallel s}^2} \Big) f_{0s} = \delta F_s + w_\perp^2\frac{\delta B}{B}\frac{m_sn_s}{2}\Big(\frac{1}{p_{\perp s}} - \frac{1}{p_{\parallel s}} \Big) f_{0s}
\]

We can eliminate the partial derivatives via integration by parts:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2} &= \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\theta \int dw_\perp\int \frac{1}{2w_\parallel}\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel}dw_\parallel \\
&= \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\theta \int dw_\perp\int\frac{1}{2w_\parallel}\mathrm{d} f_{0s} \\
&= \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\theta \int dw_\perp\Big[\cancel{\frac{f_{0s}}{2w_\parallel}\bigg\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}} - \int f_{0s}\mathrm{d}\frac{1}{2w_\parallel}\Big] \\
&= \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\theta \int dw_\perp\int\frac{1}{2w_\parallel^2}f_{0s}dw_\parallel \\
&= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} \frac{1}{2w_\parallel^2}f_{0s} \\
\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}w_\perp w_\perp^4\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\perp^2} &= 2\pi\int dw_\parallel \Big[ \cancel{\frac{1}{2}w_\perp^4f_{0s}\bigg\rvert_{-\infty}^{+\infty}} - \frac{1}{2}\int f_{0s}dw_\perp^4 \Big] \\
&= -2\pi\int dw_\parallel 2w_\perp^2 f_{0s}w_\perp dw_\perp \\
&= -2 \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w} w_\perp^2 f_{0s}
\end{aligned}
\]

This then gives us

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_pperp_perturb}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\delta p_{\perp s} &= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^2}{2}\delta f_s \\
&= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^2}{2}\delta F_s - \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^4}{2}\Big(\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\perp^2}-\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2} \Big)\frac{\delta B}{B} \\
&= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^2}{2}\delta F_s - \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\theta \int dw_\perp w_\perp \int \mathrm{d} w_\parallel \frac{m_s w_\perp^4}{2}\Big(\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\perp^2}-\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2} \Big)\frac{\delta B}{B} \\
&= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^2}{2}\delta F_s + 2\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^2}{2}\delta f_{0s}\frac{\delta B}{B} + \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{2(\frac{1}{2}m_sw_\perp^2)^2}{m_sw_\parallel^2}f_{0s}\frac{\delta B}{B} \\
&= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_s w_\perp^2}{2}\delta F_s + \frac{\delta B}{B}\Big( 2p_{\perp s} - \frac{2 p_{\perp s}^2}{p_{\parallel s}} \alpha_s )
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:kmhd_pperp_perturb}\end{equation}

where \(\alpha_s\) is some coefficients of order 1 if \(f_{0s}\) is not
bi-Maxwellian.

\(\delta F_s\) can be obtained by ignoring collisions and linearizing
and Fourier-transforming Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_kinetic_1storder}
(\(\mathbf{u}_s=0\)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i(\omega - k_\parallel w_\parallel)\delta F_s = - \Big[ m_sw_\parallel\Big( \frac{q_s}{m_s}E_\parallel - i(\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel) \delta u_{\parallel s}\Big) -i\omega\mu\delta B \Big]\frac{\partial F_{0s}}{\partial \epsilon} \\
\delta F_s = -i\frac{w_\parallel q_s E_\parallel}{\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel}\frac{\partial F_{0s}}{\partial \epsilon} - \delta u_{\parallel s}m_sw_\parallel\frac{\partial F_{0s}}{\partial\epsilon} - \frac{\omega}{\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel}\mu\delta B\frac{\partial F_{0s}}{\partial\epsilon}
\end{aligned}
\]

The first term can be ignored if \(\beta\gg 1\) (??? See the complete
calculation in another note!); otherwise \(E_\parallel\) can be got by
imposing \(\sum_s q_s n_s = 0\). The second term can be shown to be
equivalent to
\(\delta u_{\parallel s}\partial f_{0s}/\partial w_\parallel\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel} &= \frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial \epsilon}\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial w_\parallel} + \frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial\mu}\cancel{\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial w_\parallel}} \\
&= \frac{\partial F_{0s}}{\partial\epsilon}m_s w_\parallel
\end{aligned}
\]

so this will not contribute to \(\delta p_\perp\) because it integrates
to 0.

The third term can be written as

\[
\frac{\omega}{\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel}\mu\delta B\frac{\partial F_{0s}}{\partial\epsilon} = \frac{\omega}{\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}\frac{\delta B}{B}\frac{1}{w_\parallel}\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel} = \frac{\omega}{\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel} m_sw_\perp^2\frac{\delta B}{B}\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2}
\]

Thus, the ``relevant'' part of \(\delta F_s\) is

\[
\delta F_s = -\frac{\omega}{\omega-k_\parallel w_\parallel} m_sw_\perp^2\frac{\delta B}{B}\frac{\partial f_{0s}}{\partial w_\parallel^2}
\]

and its contribution to \(\delta p_{\perp s}\) is

\[
\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}\delta F_s = \frac{\delta B}{B}\frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}\int\frac{dw_\parallel}{w_\parallel - \frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}} \Big[ \frac{\partial}{\partial w_\parallel^2}\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}_\perp \frac{m_s^2w_\perp^4}{2} f_{0s} \Big]
\]

Here we have \(|k_\parallel|\) because if \(k_\parallel <0\), we can
change the variable \(w_\parallel \rightarrow -w_\parallel\). This
involves the Landau integral, which can be evaluated with the residual
theorem Equation~\ref{eq:residual_thm} when integrate in the complex
plane mostly along the real axis and the large semicircle in the upper
half plane except for a small semicircle just below the pole (ADD
FIGURE!):

\[
\frac{1}{w_\parallel - \frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}} = P\frac{1}{w_\parallel - \frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}} + i\pi\delta\Big(w_\parallel - \frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|} \Big)
\]

so

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}\delta F_s &= \frac{\delta B}{B}\Big[ \cancel{\frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}P\int\frac{dw_\parallel}{w_\parallel - \frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}} \big[ ... \big]} + i\pi\frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|}\big[ ... \big]_{w_\parallel}=\omega/|k_\parallel| \Big]
\end{aligned}
\]

The first term is small when we assume
\(\omega\ll k_\parallel v_{\text{th}s\parallel}\); the second term must
be kept because it is the lowest-order imaginary part which will lead to
instability.

For a bi-Maxwellian,

\[
\Big[ \frac{\partial}{\partial w_\parallel^2}\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}_\perp\frac{m_s^2w_\perp^4}{2}f_{0s} \Big]_{w_\parallel=\omega/|k_\parallel|} = -\frac{2p_{\perp s}^2}{p_{\parallel s}}\frac{e^{-\frac{\omega^2}{k_\parallel^2 v_{\text{th}\parallel s}^2}}}{\sqrt{\pi}v_{\text{th}\parallel s}}
\]

The exponential term is nearly 1. If it is not a bi-Maxwellian, then we
need to multiply by a coefficient \(\alpha_s \sim 1\).

Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_pperp_perturb} becomes

\[
\delta p_{\perp s} = \frac{\delta B}{B}\Big[ 2p_{\perp s} - \frac{2p_{\perp s}^2}{p_{\parallel s}}\Big( \alpha_s + i\sqrt{\pi}\frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel|v_{\text{th}\parallel s}}\sigma_s \Big) \Big]
\]

This goes into Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_perturb_perp}:

\[
\rho \omega^2 = k_\perp^2\frac{B^2}{\mu_0}\Big[ \sum_s(1 - \frac{p_{\perp s}}{p_{\parallel s}}\alpha_s)\beta_{\perp s} - i\sum_s \sigma_s\frac{p_{\perp s}}{p_{\parallel s}}\beta_{\perp s}\sqrt{\pi}\frac{\omega}{|k_\parallel| v_{\text{th} \parallel s}} + 1 \Big] + k_\parallel^2 \frac{B^2}{\mu_0}\Big[ \sum_s\frac{\beta_{\perp s}}{2}\big( 1 - \frac{p_{\parallel s}}{p_{\perp s}} \big) + 1 \Big]
\]

The left-hand side can be neglected because
\(\omega\ll k_\parallel v_{\text{th}\parallel s}\). The electron thermal
velocity \(v_{\text{th}\parallel e}\) in the denominator can be
neglected because
\(v_{\text{th}\parallel e} \gg v_{\text{th}\parallel i}\). The growth
rate \(\gamma\) is the imaginary part of \(\omega\). Reorganize the last
equation:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_mirror_dispersion}{}{
\sigma_i\frac{p_{\perp i}}{p_{\parallel i}}\beta_{\perp i}\sqrt{\pi}\frac{\gamma}{|k_\parallel|v_{\text{th}\parallel i}} = \sum_s \Big(\frac{p_\perp s}{p_\parallel s}\alpha_s - 1 \Big)\beta_{\perp s} - 1 -\frac{k_\parallel^2}{k_\perp^2}\Big[ \sum_s\frac{\beta_{\perp s}}{2}\big( 1-\frac{p_{\parallel s}}{p_{\perp s}}\big) + 1 \Big]
}\label{eq:kmhd_mirror_dispersion}\end{equation}

where
\(\Lambda\equiv \frac{k_\parallel^2}{k_\perp^2}\sum_s \Big(\frac{p_\perp s}{p_\parallel s}\alpha_s - 1 \Big)\beta_{\perp s} - 1\)
triggers instability if this is positive:

\[
\sum_s \Big(\frac{p_\perp s}{p_\parallel s}\alpha_s - 1 \Big)\beta_{\perp s} > 1
\]

Examining where this comes from, we see that this amounts to
\(\delta p_\perp\) modifying the magnetic pressure force and turning it
from positive to negative:

\[
\delta p_\perp + \frac{B\delta B}{\mu_0} = \frac{B\delta B}{\mu_0}\Big[ \underbrace{1}_{\text{B pressure}} - \underbrace{\sum_s\Big( \frac{p_{\perp s}}{p_{\parallel s}}\alpha_s - 1 \Big)\beta_{\perp s}}_{\substack{\text{non-resonant} \\ \text{particle pressure}}} + \underbrace{...}_{\substack{\text{resonant particle} \\ \text{pressure}}} \Big]
\]

Thus, fundamentally, pressure anisotropy makes it easier to compress or
rarefy magnetic field --- and things become unstable when the sign of
the pressure flips and it becomes energetically profitable to create
compressions and rarefications. (ADD FIGURE!) The dispersion relation
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_mirror_dispersion} is basically a statement of
pressure balance between the magnetic pressure, the non-resonant
particle pressure \(\delta p_\perp\) and the resonant particle pressure
\(\propto\gamma\), which came from the \emph{betatron acceleration}
\(\mu \mathrm{d}B/\mathrm{d}t\) in
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_kinetic_1storder}.

The betatron acceleration term refers to what happens in the stable
case. When magnetic pressure opposes formation of \(\delta B\)
perturbations (say, troughs), to compensate it, we must have
\(\gamma<0\) and energy goes from \(\delta B\) to resonant particles,
which are accelerated by the mirror force. The corresponding decaying of
\(\delta B\) is the well-known \emph{Barnes damping} (landau damping of
``mirror field'', Barnes 1966, also known as transit-time damping from
Stix's book. See more discussion on the physics in Southwood \& Kivelson
1993.)

To finish the job, note that, from
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_mirror_dispersion} (ADD FIGURE!) for a given
\(k_\perp\)

\[
\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial k_\parallel}\bigg\rvert_{k_\perp} \propto \Lambda - \frac{k_\parallel^2}{k_\perp^2}\Big[\sum_s\frac{\beta_{\perp s}}{2}\Big(1-\frac{p_\parallel s}{p_\perp s} \Big) + 1 \Big]
\]

The maximum growth rate is reached when the right-hand side goes to 0,
which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{3}\Lambda\), so the maximum growth
rate

\[
\gamma_{\text{max}} = \frac{|k_\parallel|v_{\text{th}\parallel i}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{2}{3}\Lambda \frac{p_{\parallel i}}{p_{\perp i}}\frac{1}{\sigma_i\beta_{\perp i}}
\]

We have assumed \(\gamma\ll k_\parallel v_{\text{th}\parallel s}\),
which is indeed true if

\[
\Lambda\frac{1}{\beta_{\perp i}} = \big(\sum_s A_s \beta_{\perp s} - 1 \big)\frac{1}{\beta_{\perp i}}\ll 1
\]

so our approximations are consistent.

If we are close to marginal instablity,

\[
\frac{k_\parallel}{k_\perp}\sim\sqrt{\Lambda}\ll 1
\]

so mirror modes are highly oblique near the threshold.

Another important point is that again we encounter the UV catastrophe
since \(\gamma\propto k_\parallel\). The mirror mode is a fast,
microscale instability whose peak growth rate is outside KMHD regime.
Including finite larmor radius gives (Hellinger 2007 PoP 14, 082105?)

\[
\gamma_{\text{peak}}\sim\Big(A-\frac{1}{\beta}\Big)^2\beta\Omega_i,\quad k_{\text{peak}}r_i\sim\Big( A-\frac{1}{\beta}\Big)\beta
\]

Thus, any high-\(\beta\) macroscopic solution of KMHD with
\(p_\perp>p_\parallel\) will blow up, just like the case for
\(p_\parallel > p_\perp\), and again what happens next depends on how
mirror instability saturates. Note that \(A_e\) is ignored since
\(A_e\ll A_i\) (?). The mirror instability condition is

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{p_{\perp i}}{p_{\parallel i}} - 1 > \frac{1}{\beta_{\perp i}} = \frac{1}{\beta_{\parallel i}}\frac{p_{\parallel i}}{p_{\perp i}} \\
\frac{p_{\perp i}}{p_{\parallel i}}\Big( \frac{p_{\perp i}}{p_{\parallel i}}-1\Big) > \frac{1}{\beta_{\parallel i}}
\end{aligned}
\]

\hypertarget{origin-of-pressure-anisotropy}{%
\section{Origin of Pressure
Anisotropy}\label{origin-of-pressure-anisotropy}}

So far we have seen that the bottom line is that any macroscopic,
high-\(\beta\) KMHD solution that has \(p_\perp\neq p_\parallel\) (more
precisely, \(|p_\perp - p_\parallel|/p \gtrsim 1/\beta\)) will be
voilently unstable to either firehose or mirror --- both of which are
fast and micro-scale modes giving rise to fluctuations outside the KMHD
regime (and, by the way, also outside gyrokinetics --- too close to
cyclotron frequency, \(k_\parallel/k_\perp\) not small enough,
\(\delta\mathbf{B}/B\) also not small enough). How worried should this
make us about the applicability of KMHD to high-\(\beta\) plasmas that
are not collisional enough to be fully fluid (i.e.~\(\nu\ll\Omega_s\))?

The answer is, \emph{very worried}! A key property of low-frequency,
weakly collisional dynamics is that the magnetic moment
\(\mu=m_sw_\perp^2/2B\) is conserved by particles. The mean \(\mu\) of
particles of species \(s\) is

\[
<\mu>_w = \frac{1}{n_s}\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\mu f_s = \frac{p_{\perp s}}{n_s B} = \text{const.}
\]

For the purpose of a qualitative discussion, let us pretend for a moment
that \(n_s=\text{const}\) (incompressible plasmas, \(\beta\gg 1\)). Then
the above conservation relation says that, locally in a fluid element
(\(\mathbf{w}\) is peculari velocity), every time you change
\(\mathbf{B}\), you must change \(p_{\perp s}\) proportionally (but not
\(p_{\parallel s}\)). Thus we expect (?)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_pressure_change}{}{
\frac{1}{p_{\perp s}}\frac{\mathrm{d} p_{\perp s}}{\mathrm{d}t}\sim\underbrace{\frac{1}{B}\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}}_{\mu\text{ conservation}} - \underbrace{\nu_s\frac{p_{\perp s}-p_{\parallel s}}{p_{\perp s}}}_{\substack{\text{relaxation of pressure} \\ \text{anisotropy by collisions}}}
}\label{eq:kmhd_pressure_change}\end{equation}

It is useful to remind ourselves that \(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}t\) is in
the \(\mathbf{u}_s\) frame. Balancing the two effects on the right-hand
side,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_pressure_balance}{}{
\Delta_s = \frac{p_{\perp s} - p_{\parallel s}}{p_{\perp s}} \sim\frac{1}{\nu_s}\frac{1}{B}\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}
}\label{eq:kmhd_pressure_balance}\end{equation}

This expression is valid only if \(\Delta_s\ll 1\),
i.e.~\(\nu_s\gg \frac{1}{B}\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}\), otherwise
\(\Delta_s\) will grow with time as B is changed. Thus

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  B increases locally \(\rightarrow \Delta_s >0 \rightarrow\) mirror
\item
  B decreases locally \(\rightarrow \Delta_s <0 \rightarrow\) firehose
\end{itemize}

As nealy any large-scale dynamics involves local changes in
\(\mathbf{B}\), this means that nearly any macroscopic solution of KMHD
in the high-\(\beta\) regime will be unstable. A very good example is
the dynamo problem: when magnetic field is randomly stretched by
turbulence, leading (in MHD) to exponential growth of magnetic energy
(and, eventually, to saturated fields we observe), locally one find
structures of this sort: (ADD FIGURE!)

Generally speaking, in order to understand long-time evolution, we need
some sort of mean-field theory for the large-scale effect of the
microscale instabilities on the dynamics. Presumably, this is to keep
preserve anisotropy, marginal out (?) the instabilities (as indeed
appears to be confirmed by the solar wind measurements --- see Bale +
2009).

There are two ways in which this can happen --- firehose and mirror
fluctuations might scatter particles, leading to higher effective
collisionality and ? control the pressure anisotropy

\[
-\frac{2}{\beta}\lesssim \frac{p_\perp - p_\parallel}{p}\lesssim \frac{1}{\beta}
\]

They might inhibit changes of B, which is another way of keeping
\(\Delta\) under control. Which of these matters for dynamics, see the
speculative overview of the possible consequences of either mechanisim
in MNRAS 440, 3226 (2014).

\hypertarget{remarks}{%
\section{Remarks}\label{remarks}}

\hypertarget{remark-i}{%
\subsection{Remark I}\label{remark-i}}

If we assume incompressibility, the magnetic induction
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_induction2} becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u} \\
\frac{1}{B}\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} = \hat{b}\hat{b}:\nabla\mathbf{u}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then, from Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_pressure_balance},

\[
p_{\perp s} - p_{\parallel s}\sim\frac{p_s}{\nu_c}\hat{b}\hat{b}:\nabla\mathbf{u}
\]

where \(p_s/\nu_c\) is the parallel dynamical viscosity. Putting this
back into Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_momentum_species_gyrotropic}, we get the
lowest order ??? MHD equation. So, from the large-scale point of view,
pressure anisotropy is viscous stress --- but the resulting equations
are ill-posed (blow up via instabilities with
\(\gamma\propto k_\parallel\)).

\hypertarget{remark-ii}{%
\subsection{Remark II}\label{remark-ii}}

More rigorously, Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_pressure_change} can be obtained
via ``CGL equations'', i.e.~the evolution equations of \(p_{\perp s}\)
and \(p_{\parallel s}\). Namely
\(\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}\)
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_boltzmann_1storder}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_cgl_perp}{}{
p_{\perp s}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\ln\frac{p_{\perp s}}{n_s B} = -\nabla\cdot(q_{\perp s}\hat{b}) - q_{\perp s}\nabla\cdot\hat{b} - \nu_s(p_{\perp s} - p_{\parallel s})
}\label{eq:kmhd_cgl_perp}\end{equation}

\(\int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_sw_\parallel^2\)
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_boltzmann_1storder}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:kmhd_cgl_par}{}{
p_{\parallel s}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\ln\frac{p_{\parallel s}B^2}{n_s^3} = -\nabla\cdot(q_{\parallel s}\hat{b}) + 2q_{\perp s}\nabla\cdot\hat{b} - 2\nu_s (p_{\parallel s} - p_{\perp s})
}\label{eq:kmhd_cgl_par}\end{equation}

The left-hand side is the conservation of \(J=\oint dl w_\parallel\),
i.e.~``bounce invariant''. The new feature here is heat fluxes:

\[
\begin{aligned}
q_{\perp s} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}\frac{m_sw_\perp^2}{2}w_\parallel f_s \\
q_{\parallel s} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}m_sw_\parallel^3 f_s
\end{aligned}
\]

They are here because particles can flow in and out of a fluid element
and thus affect the conservation (or otherwise) of \(<\mu>_w\) and
\(<J^2>_w\) within it.

Finally, from Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_cgl_perp} and
Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_cgl_par},

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(p_{\perp s} - p_{\parallel s}) &= (p_{\perp s} + 2p_{\parallel s})\frac{1}{B}\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} + (p_{\perp s} - 3p_{\parallel s})\frac{1}{n_s}\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
&-\nabla\cdot[(q_{\perp s}-q_{\parallel s})\hat{b}] - 3q_{\perp s}\nabla\cdot\hat{b} - 3\nu_s(p_{\perp s} - p_{\parallel s})
\end{aligned}
\]

???

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_s &= \frac{p_{\perp s}-p_{\parallel s}}{p_s} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\nu_s}\Big\{ \frac{1}{B}\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} - \frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{n_s}\frac{dn_s}{\mathrm{d}t} - \frac{\nabla\cdot[((q_{\perp s} - q_{\parallel s})\hat{b})] + 3q_{\perp s}\nabla\cdot\hat{b}}{3p_s} \Big\}
\end{aligned}
\]

Typically, what prominent here are electron heat fluxes. So heat fluxes
can also lead to anisotropies and so macroscopic solutions of KMHD
involving temperature gradients will also go unstable at microscales!

So here we are, we cannot change B at large scales, we cannot
compress/rarefy the plasma and we cannot have temperature gradients
without having to deal everything exploding and needing new equations.
Enjoy!

\hypertarget{sec:gyrokinetics}{%
\chapter{Gyrokinetics}\label{sec:gyrokinetics}}

This is taken from the slide given by Frank Jenko from
Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik.

Gyrokinetics is a theory for describing plasmas at a much finer level.
If kinetic effects (e.g.~finite Larmor radius, Landau damping, magnetic
trapping etc.) play a role, MHD is not applicable, and one has to use a
kinetic description.

Once again we start from the Vlasov-Maxwell equation. Removing the fast
gyromotion under the assumption \(\omega\ll\Omega\) leads to a dramatic
speed-up. Thus we can think the basic element of charged rings as
quasiparticles: it is described by gyrocenter coordinates and can keep
the kinetic effects.

\hypertarget{a-brief-historical-review}{%
\section{A Brief Historical Review}\label{a-brief-historical-review}}

The word ``gyrokinetics'' appeared in the literature in the late 1960s,
first proposed by Rutherford, Frieman, Taylor and Hastie. The goal is to
provide an adequate formalism for the linear kinetic drift waves study
in general magnetic configurations, including finite Larmor radius
effects. The first nonlinear set of equations for the perturbed
distribution function \(\delta f\) was given by Friemann and Liu Chen in
1982, who also introduced the gyrokinetic ordering. Gyrokinetic theory
is based on Hamiltonian methods, which means that from a Lagrangian
description, we remove the gyro-angle dependency by the change of
coordinate systems to describe the equation of motion.

\hypertarget{coordinate-transformation}{%
\section{Coordinate Transformation}\label{coordinate-transformation}}

We perform the following coordinate transformation from the charged
particle's phase space (\(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v}\)) to the corresponding
guiding-center phase space (\(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{V}\)), where:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X}_\perp + X_\parallel \mathbf{b}_0,\quad \mathbf{X}_\perp = \mathbf{x}_\perp + \mathbf{r}_L,\quad \mathbf{r}_L = \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{b}_0 / \Omega_c
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\mathbf{V} = [\epsilon=v^2/2, \mu=v_\perp^2/2B_0, \sigma=\text{sgn}(v_\parallel)]
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{b}_0 = \mathbf{B}_0/B_0\), \(\mathbf{r}_L\) is the
gyroradius vector, \(v_\parallel=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_0\), \(\mu\)
is the magnetic moment adiabatic invariant and, assuming there is no
equilibrium electrostatic potential, \(\epsilon\) is an equilibrium
constant of motion.

In the guiding-center phase space, charged particle dynamics is
naturally separated into the fast cyclotron motion and the slow
guiding-center motion. One can then apply the gyrokinetic orderings and
systematically average out the fast cyclotron motion (i.e., the
gyrophase averaging) and obtain the asymptotically dominant (in terms of
the smallness parameter \(\epsilon\)) perturbed distribution function
response. This perturbed distribution function in the guiding-center
phase space can then be \emph{inversely transformed} back to the charged
particle phase space and applied toward the field equations (i.e.,
Maxwell's equations) for a self-consistent kinetic description.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Obtain Vlasov equation in the guiding center coordinates.
\item
  Obtain Maxwell's equations in the guiding center coordinates.
\end{itemize}

Why do we need extra steps before using Maxwell's equations? It is
because in Maxwell's equations the particle information
(\(\rho, \mathbf{j}\)) are described not in the guiding center
coordinates. The distribution we obtain from Vlasov equation must be
transformed back to ordinary coordinates and then we can do the moment
integral.

In the guiding center coordinates, density and current density can be
expressed as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_density}{}{
n = \bar{N}_0 + \bar{\nabla}\cdot\Big( \frac{c\bar{N}_0}{B\Omega}\bar{\nabla}_\perp \delta\phi \Big) + \frac{\bar{N}_0\delta B_\parallel}{B} + \int \bar{F}_1d\mathbf{p}
}\label{eq:gk_density}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_current_density}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{j} &= -\frac{\bar{N}_0 q^2}{cm}\delta A_\parallel\hat{b} + \int\frac{q \bar{\mathbf{P}}_\parallel}{m}\hat{b}\mathrm{d}\bar{\mathbf{P}} + \frac{cq\bar{N}_0}{B}\hat{b}\times\bar{\nabla}\delta\phi + \frac{3c^2\bar{N}_0\bar{T}}{2B^2\Omega}\hat{b}\times\bar{\nabla}\bar{\nabla}_\perp^2\delta\phi \\
&+ \frac{2c\bar{N}_0 \bar{T}}{B^2}\hat{b}\times\bar{\nabla}\delta B_\parallel + \frac{\hat{b}}{B}\times\bar{\nabla}(c\bar{N}_0\bar{T}) + \hat{b}\times\bar{\nabla}\int c\bar{\mu}\bar{F}_1 \mathrm{d}\bar{\mathbf{P}}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:gk_current_density}\end{equation}

Note that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In Vlasov equation in the guiding center coordinates, the
  \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift, gradient drift and curvature
  drift all appears but the polarization drift is missing.
\item
  In Equation~\ref{eq:gk_density}, only the polarization term correction
  appears. From Hamilton's mechanics, all term that has a explicit time
  dependency will not contribute here since it will break the energy
  conservation of the system.

Figure~\ref{fig:kinetics2gk} shows the basic idea of gyrokinetic
approximation. There is a strong magnetic field pointing into the plane.
The electrostatic potential fluctuations are shown by the colored
contours. The particle orbit is composed of two parts: a fast gyromotion
and a slow \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift. In gyrokinetics we
simply remove the fast gyromotion and introduce charged rings as
quasiparticles, i.e.~go from particle to gyrocenter coordinates.

\item
  Small amplitude perturbations, i.e.~energy of perturbation much

\[

\]

There exists a natural smallness parameter, \(\epsilon=r_L/L\), which we
are going to use in the ordering. In magnetically confined plasmas,
typically we have \(\epsilon\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})\ll 1\).

\[
\frac{\omega}{\Omega}\sim\frac{r_L}{L}\sim\frac{k_\parallel}{k_\perp}\sim\frac{\delta F}{F_0}\sim\frac{\delta T}{T_0}\sim\frac{\delta n}{n_0}\sim\frac{|\delta \mathbf{B}|}{|\mathbf{B}_0|}\sim\frac{q\delta\phi}{T}\sim\epsilon
\]

Usually low-frequency (\(|\omega/\Omega_i|\sim\epsilon\)) but
short-wavelength (\(k_\perp r_L \sim 1\)) fluctuations are of interest
in gyrokinetics. To include Landau resonance (???),

\[
k_\parallel v_\parallel\sim \omega,\quad\text{or}\quad |k_\perp r_i|\sim 1
\]

Noting, furthermore, for \(|k_\perp r_i|\sim 1\) and the ratio of plasma
ion pressure to the background magnetic field energy density
\(\beta_i \lesssim 1\):

\[
\beta = \frac{P_{0i}}{P_{0B}} = \frac{m_i n_i v_{\perp i}^2/2}{B_0^2/2\mu_0} = \frac{v_{\perp i}^2}{v_A^2}
\]

\[
\bigg\lvert \frac{\omega}{k_\perp v_A} \bigg\rvert \sim \bigg\lvert \frac{\omega}{\Omega_i} \bigg\rvert \bigg\lvert \frac{1}{k_\perp r_{iL}} \bigg\rvert \beta_i^{1/2} \lesssim \epsilon
\]

i.e.~fast waves are systematically suppressed in the gyrokinetic
orderings.

\hypertarget{a-lagriangian-approach}{%
\section{A Lagriangian Approach}\label{a-lagriangian-approach}}

If the Lagriangian of a dynamical system is known, e.g.~for charged
particle motion in non-canonical coordinates
\((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
L &= \Big(\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x},t) + m\mathbf{v}\Big)\cdot\dot{\mathbf{x}} - H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v}) \\
H &= \frac{m}{2}v^2 + e\phi(\mathbf{x},t)
\end{aligned}
\]

with \(\mathbf{B} = \nabla\times\mathbf{A}\) and
\(\mathbf{E} = -\nabla\phi - \partial_t \mathbf{A}/c\). The equation of
motion are given by the Lagrange equations (I almost forget everything
from theoretical mechanics\ldots):

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0,\quad i=1,...,6
\]

For charged particles,

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\mathbf{v}}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = 0 ?
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} &= \mathbf{v} \\
\dot{\mathbf{v}} &= \frac{e}{m}(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})
\end{aligned}
\]

In gyrokinetics we add low-frequency, anisotropic, small-amplitude
fluctuations:

\[
\frac{\omega}{\Omega_i} \sim \frac{k_\parallel}{k_\perp}\sim\frac{e\phi}{T_e} \sim \epsilon
\]

We need a transition from particle coordinates
\((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})\) to guiding center coordinates
\((\mathbf{R},v_\parallel, \mu, \varphi)\). The easy way is to construct
a new Lagrangian using Lie transforms (???)

\[
\Gamma = \Big( mv_\parallel\hat{b}_0 + \frac{e}{c}\bar{\mathbf{A}}_{1\parallel}\hat{b}_0 + \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}_0 \Big)\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{X} + \frac{mc}{e}\mu \mathrm{d}\theta - \Big( \frac{m}{2}v_\parallel^2 + \mu B_0 + \mu \bar{B}_{1\parallel} + e\bar{\phi}_1 \Big)\mathrm{d}t
\]

where \(\mu\) is the magnetic moment, \(\theta\) is the gyroangle, and
the overbar denotes a gyroaveraging operation. This gives the
Euler-Lagrange equations

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_euler_lagrange}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathbf{X}} &= v_\parallel\hat{b} + \frac{B}{B_\parallel^\ast}\Big[ \frac{v_\perp}{B}\bar{\mathbf{B}}_{1\perp} + \frac{c}{B^2}\bar{\mathbf{E}}_1\times\mathbf{B} + \frac{\mu}{m\Omega}\hat{b}\times\nabla(B+\bar{B}_{1\parallel}) + \frac{v_\parallel^2}{\Omega}(\nabla\times\hat{b})_\perp \Big] \\
\dot{v}_\parallel &= \frac{\dot{\mathbf{X}}}{mv_\parallel}\cdot\big( e\bar{\mathbf{E}}_1 - \mu\nabla(B+\bar{B}_{1\parallel}) \big) \\
\dot{\mu} &= 0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:gk_euler_lagrange}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:gk_euler_lagrange} contains all the drifts we have seen
in Section~\ref{sec:single}.

Applying the gyrokinetic approximation, the effective gyroaveraged
potential over one gyroperiod can be written using Fourier transform
(???):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\phi^{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{x},r_L) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\theta \phi(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{r}_L) \\

\end{aligned}
\]

where \(J_0\) is the zeroth order Bessel function.

\hypertarget{linear-gyrokinetics}{%
\subsection{Linear Gyrokinetics}\label{linear-gyrokinetics}}

We shall limit our considerations to that of a simple uniform plasma
with an isotropic Maxwellian equilibrium distribution function.
Assuming, furthermore, \(\beta\) (ratio between the plasma and magnetic
pressures) \(\ll 1\), such that there is negligible magnetic
compression, the particle velocity distribution is then given by:

\[
f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t) = f_M(\epsilon) + \delta f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t)
\]

where \(f_M(\epsilon)=n_0/(\pi^{3/2}v_t^3)\exp(-\epsilon/v_t^2)\) is the
Maxwellian distribution function, \(v_t\) is the thermal speed (HOW TO
UNDERSTAND THIS???):

\[
\delta f = \frac{q}{T}f_M(\epsilon)\delta\phi + e^{-\mathbf{r}_L\cdot\nabla}\delta g
\]

\(T=mv_t^2/2\), \(\delta g\) satisfies the following linear gyrokinetic
equation:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\Big( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}+v_\parallel\mathbf{b}_0\cdot\nabla \Big)\delta g = \frac{q}{T}f_M(\epsilon)\frac{\partial} {\partial t}\left< \delta L_g \right>_\alpha \\
\delta L_g = e^{-\mathbf{r}_L\cdot\nabla}\delta L \\
\delta L = \delta \phi - v_\parallel \delta A_\parallel/c
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:gk_linear}\end{equation}

and \(<...>_\alpha\) denotes averaging over the gyrophase angle,
\(\alpha\). Here, the field variables are the scalar and vector
potentials, \(\delta\phi\) and \(\delta\mathbf{A}\), with
\(\delta A_\parallel=\delta\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{b}_0\) and the
\(\nabla\cdot\delta\mathbf{A}=0\) Coulomb gauge. The operator
\(e^{-\mathbf{r}_L\cdot\nabla}\), meanwhile, represents the
transformation between the particle and guiding center positions.

The corresponding field equations are the Poisson's equation and the
parallel Ampère's law,
\(\nabla^2 \delta A_\parallel = -4\pi\delta J_\parallel/c\). In the
low-frequency and \(|k\lambda_D|^2\ll 1\) limit with \(\lambda_D\) being
the Debye length, Poisson's equation can be approximated as the
quasi-neutrality condition; \(\sum_j n_{0j}q_j<\delta f_j>_v\simeq 0\).
Here, \(<...>_v = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} (...)\) is the
velocity-space integral, and subscript \(j\) runs over the particle
species. Meanwhile, substituting the parallel Ampère's law into the
\(\nabla\cdot\delta\mathbf{J}\simeq 0\) quasi-neutrality condition as
derived by Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear} yields a generalized linear
gyrokinetic vorticity equation, which is often convenient to use in
studying shear/kinetic Alfvén wave dynamics.

\textbf{Linear kinetic Alfvén wave properties}

(WARNING: SUPER HARD TO FOLLOW!) For plane wave \(\omega,\mathbf{k}\)
perturbations, Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear} gives:

\[
\delta g_\mathbf{k} = -\frac{q}{T}f_M J_0(k_\perp \mathbf{r}_L) \frac{\omega}{k_\parallel v_\parallel - \omega}\Big( \delta\phi - \frac{v_\parallel}{c}\delta A_\parallel \Big)_\mathbf{k}
\]

\(J_0\) is the Bessel function and \(J_0(k_\perp \mathbf{r}_L)\)
corresponds to the gyro-averaging of the coordinate transformation, that
is:

\[
<\exp(-\mathbf{r}_L\cdot\nabla)>_\alpha = J_0(k_\perp r_L)
\]

In SAW/KAW analyses, it is sometimes convenient to introduce an
\emph{effective induced parallel potential} defined by
\(\mathbf{b}_0\cdot\nabla\delta\Psi = -\partial_t \delta A_\parallel/c\)
or:

\[
\delta\Psi_\mathbf{k} = \omega\delta A_{\parallel\mathbf{k}} / (ck_\parallel)
\]

\(\delta\Psi\), thus, gives rise to the induced parallel electric field;
that is, the net parallel electric field is given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta E_\parallel &= -\mathbf{b}_0\cdot\nabla(\delta\phi-\delta\Psi)\quad\text{or} \\
\delta E_{\parallel\mathbf{k}} &= -ik_\parallel(\delta\phi-\delta\Psi)_\mathbf{k}
\end{aligned}
\]

The quasi-neutrality condition then straightforwardly yields: (Chen and
Hasegawa 1991)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_quasi_neutrality_derive}{}{
\sum_j\Big( \frac{n_0 q^2}{T_0} \Big)_j \{ \delta\phi_\mathbf{k} + \Gamma_{0kj}[\xi_{kj}Z_{kj}\delta\phi_\mathbf{k} - (1+\xi_{kj}Z_{kj}\delta\Psi_\mathbf{k})] \} = 0
}\label{eq:gk_linear_quasi_neutrality_derive}\end{equation}

Here, \(\xi_{kj}=\omega/|k_\parallel|v_{tj},Z_{kj}=Z(\xi_{kj})\) with
\(Z\) being the well-known plasma dispersion function
(Equation~\ref{eq:plasma_dispersion_function}), and
\(\Gamma_{0kj} = I_0(b_{kj})\exp(-b_{kj})\) with \(I_0\) the modified
Bessel function and
\(b_{kj}=k_\perp^2 r_{Lj}/2 = k_\perp^2(T_j/m_j)/\Omega_j^2\). The
linear gyrokinetic vorticity equation, meanwhile, is given by: (Chen and
Hasegawa 1991)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_vorticity}{}{
i\frac{c^2}{4\pi\omega}k_\parallel^2 k_\perp^2 \delta\Psi_\mathbf{k} - i \sum_j\Big( \frac{n_0q^2}{T_0} \Big)_j (1-\Gamma_{0kj})\omega\delta\phi_\mathbf{k} = 0
}\label{eq:gk_linear_vorticity}\end{equation}

Nothing that, for KAW, \(|k_\perp r_{Li}| \sim\mathcal{O}(1)\) and
\(|k_\perp r_{Le}|\ll 1\) and, thus, \(\Gamma_{0ke}\simeq 1\),
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_quasi_neutrality_derive} and
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_vorticity} then become

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_par_potential}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_{s\mathbf{k}} \delta\phi_\mathbf{k} &= [1+\xi_{ke}Z_{ke}+\tau(1+\Gamma_k \xi_{ki}Z_ki)]\delta\phi_\mathbf{k} \\
&= [1+\xi_{ke}Z_{ke}+\tau\Gamma_k(1+\xi_{ki}Z_{ki})]\delta\Psi_\mathbf{k}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_par_potential}\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_vorticity_approxi}{}{
\omega^2 \delta\phi_\mathbf{k} = k_\parallel^2 v_A^2 \frac{b_k}{1-\Gamma_k}\delta\Psi_\mathbf{k}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_vorticity_approxi}\end{equation}

Here, \(\tau=T_{0e}/T_{0i}, b_k=b_{ki}, \Gamma_k=\Gamma_{0ki}\), and
\(\epsilon_{s\mathbf{k}}\) is the dielectric constant for the slow-sound
(ion-acoustic) wave (SSW).

It is also instructive, as done in some literatures, to define the
effective parallel potential,
\(\delta\phi_{\parallel\mathbf{k}}=\delta\phi_\mathbf{k} - \delta\Psi_\mathbf{k}\),
and rewrite Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_par_potential} and
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_vorticity_approxi} as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_par_potential2}{}{
\epsilon_{s\mathbf{k}} \delta\phi_{\parallel\mathbf{k}} = -\tau(1-\Gamma_k)\delta\Psi_\mathbf{k}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_par_potential2}\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_vorticity_approxi2}{}{
\Big[ \omega^2 - k_\parallel^2v_A^2\frac{b_k}{1-\Gamma_k} \Big] \delta\Psi_\mathbf{k} = -\omega^2\delta\phi_{\parallel\mathbf{k}}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_vorticity_approxi2}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_par_potential2} and
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_vorticity_approxi2} demonstrate the coupling
between SAW and SSW via the finite \(|k_\perp r_{Ls}|\) term. In the
\(|k_\perp r_{Li}|\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\) short-wavelength limit, SAW
evolves into KAW due to both the finite \(|k_\perp r_{Li}|\) and
\(|k_\perp r_{Ls}|\) effects. (???) More specifically, the coupled
KAW-SSW dispersion relation becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_SAW_SSW}{}{
\omega_\mathbf{k}^2\Big[ 1-\frac{\tau(1-\Gamma_k)}{\epsilon_{s\mathbf{k}}} \Big] = k_\parallel^2 v_A^2 \frac{b_k}{1-\Gamma_k}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_SAW_SSW}\end{equation}

Let us concentrate on the KAW branch and, to further simplify the
analysis, assume \(1\gg \beta_i\sim\beta_e\gg m_e/m_i\). With
\(|\omega|\sim|k_\parallel v_A|\), we then have
\(|\xi_{ki}|=|\omega/k_\parallel v_{ti}|\sim\beta_i^{-1/2}\gg 1 \gg |\xi_{ke}|\sim(m_e/m_i\beta_e)^{1/2}\),
and, keeping only the lowest order \(\mathbf{O}(1)\) terms:

\[
\epsilon_{s\mathbf{k}} \simeq 1+\tau(1-\Gamma_k) \equiv \sigma_k
\]

From Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_SAW_SSW}, we then have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_SAW_SSW_approxi}{}{
\omega_{\mathbf{k}}^2 \simeq k_\parallel^2 v_A^2\frac{\sigma_k b_k}{1-\Gamma_k}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_SAW_SSW_approxi}\end{equation}

As to wave polarizations, which are useful for wave identification in
observations, we can readily derive:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_polarization_perp}{}{
\bigg\lvert \frac{c\delta\mathbf{E}_\perp}{\delta\mathbf{B}_\perp} \bigg\rvert = v_A \Big[ \frac{b_k}{\sigma_k(1-\Gamma_k)}\Big]^{1/2}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_polarization_perp}\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_polarization_par}{}{
\bigg\lvert \frac{c\delta E_\parallel}{\delta\mathbf{B}_\perp} \bigg\rvert = v_A \bigg\lvert \frac{k_\parallel}{k_\perp}\tau \bigg\rvert\Big[ \frac{b_k(1-\Gamma_k)}{\sigma_k} \Big]^{1/2}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_polarization_par}\end{equation}

ADD PLOTS for Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_SAW_SSW_approxi},
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_polarization_perp}, and
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_polarization_par}!!!

Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_polarization_par} show that, for a fixed
\(|k_\parallel/k_\perp|, |\delta E_\parallel/\delta\mathbf{B}_\perp|\)
increases with \(b_k\). Since wave-particel energy and momentum
exchanges are proportional to \(|\delta E_\parallel|\), short-wavelength
KAW are, thus, expected to play crucial roles in the heating,
acceleration, and transport of charged particles.

In addition to having a significant \(\delta E_\parallel\), another
important property of KAW, in contrast to SAW, is that KAW has a finite
perpendicular (to \(\mathbf{B}_0\)) group velocity,
\(\mathbf{v}_{g\perp}\). Assuming \(|k_\perp r_{Li}|^2\ll 1\), we have,
letting \(\omega_A^2\equiv k_\parallel^2 v_A^2\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_KAW_kperp_large}{}{
\omega_\mathbf{k}^2 \simeq \omega_A^2(1+k_\perp^2 \hat{r}^2)
}\label{eq:gk_linear_KAW_kperp_large}\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_KAW_scale}{}{
\hat{r}^2 = (3/4 + \tau)r_{Li}^2
}\label{eq:gk_linear_KAW_scale}\end{equation}

Thus

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_KAW_group}{}{
\mathbf{v}_{g\perp}=\frac{\partial \omega_\mathbf{k}}{\partial \mathbf{k}_\perp}\simeq \frac{\omega_A^2}{\omega_\mathbf{k}}\hat{r}^2\mathbf{k}_\perp
}\label{eq:gk_linear_KAW_group}\end{equation}

\textbf{Linear mode conversion of KAW}

Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_kperp_large} has a significant
implication in non-uniform plasmas. Consider, again, a slab plasma with
a non-uniform \(\omega_A^2(x)\) and \(k_\perp^2 = k_x^2(x)\) being the
WKB wavenumber in the non-uniformity \(x\)-direction.
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_kperp_large} then indicates that KAW is
propagating (\(k_x^2>0\)) in the \(\omega_\mathbf{k}^2>\omega_A^2(x)\)
region, and it is cutoff (\(k_x^2<0\)) in the
\(\omega_\mathbf{k}^2<\omega_A^2(x)\) region. That
\(\mathbf{v}_{g\perp}\) is finite also suggests that, in constrast to
SAW, an initial smooth perturbation will not only evolve into short
wavelengths, but also propagate toward the lower \(\omega_A^2(x)\)
region. These features are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:gk_KAW_evolution}(b); where the spatial-temporal
evolution of KAW is solved explicitly according to the following wave
equation: (DO IT MYSELF!!!)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing}{}{
\Big[ \hat{r}^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} - 1 - \frac{1}{\omega_A^2(x)}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \Big] \delta B_y(x,t) = 0
}\label{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing}\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing} can be readily derived from
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_kperp_large} by letting
\(\omega_\mathbf{k}=i\partial/\partial t\) and
\(k_\perp=-i\partial/\partial x\). The spatial profile of
\(\omega_A^2(x)/\omega^2 = 1/(1+x^2/L^2)\) is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:gk_KAW_evolution}(a), with \(L\) indicating the profile
length-scale, so that the KAW wave-packet frequency is assumed to be
consistent with the SAW frequency at \(x=0\).
Figure~\ref{fig:gk_KAW_evolution}(b) shows the propagation of the KAW
wave-packet in the direction of radial non-uniformity, consistent with
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_group}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:gk_KAW_evolution}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/gk_kaw_propagation.png}
\caption{(a) Spatial dependence of \(\omega_A^2\). (b) Propagation of
the KAW wave-packet in the non-uniformity
direction.}\label{fig:gk_KAW_evolution}
}
\end{figure}

That there exists a finite perpendicular group velocity also implies, in
the steady state, the removal of ``singular'' resonance and linear mode
conversion process (Hasegawa and Chen 1976, see also
Section~\ref{sec:flr}). More specifically, the corresponding wave
equation is given by:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing2}{}{
\Big[\hat{r}^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \Big( \frac{\omega_0^2}{\omega_A^2(x)} - 1 \Big) \Big]\delta\hat{B}_y(x) = \delta\hat{B}_{y0}
}\label{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing2}\end{equation}

Here, \(\omega_0\) is the external driving frequency. In the ideal SAW
(\(\hat{r}\rightarrow 0\)) limit, there is the resonance singularity at
\(x_0\), where \(\omega_0^2 = \omega_A^2(x_0)\). Noting that, near
\(x=x_0\),
\(\omega_A^2(x)\simeq \omega_0^2 + (\omega_A^2)^\prime(x_0)(x-x_0)\equiv \omega_0^2 - (\omega_0^2/L_A)(x-x_0)\),
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing2} can be approximated as an
inhomogeneous Airy equation and solved analytically.
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_governing2} can then be solved, with
appropriate boundary conditions, by connecting the solutions valid away
from the \(x=x_0\) resonance layer via the analytic solution of the
inhomogeneous Airy equation valid near \(x=x_0\) (Hasegawa and Chen
1975, 1976). The solutions away from the singular layer are given by:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:inhomogeneous_by_sol}{}{
\delta\hat{B}_y(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
\frac{\delta\hat{B}_{y0}}{\epsilon_A(x)} & \text{for }\omega_0^2 < \omega_A^2(x) \\
\frac{\delta\hat{B}_{y0}}{\epsilon_A(x)} - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\delta\hat{B}_{y0}}{(\hat{r}/L_A)^{1/2}}\Big( \frac{\hat{r}^2}{\epsilon_A(x)} \Big)^{1/4}\exp\Big[ i\int_{x_0}^x \Big( \frac{\epsilon_A(x^\prime)}{\hat{r}^2} \Big)^{1/2} \mathrm{d}x^\prime +i\frac{\pi}{4} \Big] & \text{for }\omega_0^2 > \omega_A^2(x)
\end{array}
\right.
}\label{eq:inhomogeneous_by_sol}\end{equation}

where

\[
\epsilon_A(x) = \frac{\omega_0^2}{\omega_A^2(x)} - 1
\]

The corresponding numerical solutions are plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:gk_KAW_MHD}. (I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!)

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:gk_KAW_MHD}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/gk_kaw_propagation.png}

ordinate.}\label{fig:gk_KAW_MHD}
}
\end{figure}

Both the analytical results and mode conversion process exhibit two
important features. One is, instead of being singular, the amplitude at
\(x=x_0\) (where \(\omega_A(x_0) = \omega_0\)) is amplified by the Airy
swelling factor \((L_A/\hat{r})^{2/3}\). Here, we recall \(L_A\) is the
scale length of \(\omega_A\) and \(\hat{r}\), from
Equation~\ref{eq:gk_linear_KAW_scale}, is of \(\mathcal{O}(r_{Li})\),
and, hence, \(|L_A/\hat{r}|\gg 1\). The other is the singularity at
\(x=x_0\) is being replaced by the Airy scale length
\(\Delta_0=(\hat{r}^2L_A)^{1/3}\). Recalling, from
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_alfven_wavenumber_nonuniform},
\(|k_x|\simeq |\omega_A^\prime| t\simeq (\omega/L_A)t\), there then
exists a KAW formation time scale given by
\((\omega_0/L_A)t_0\simeq 1/\Delta_0\); i.e.,
\(\omega_0 t_0\simeq (L_A/\hat{r})^{2/3}\). Taking, for an example, a
typical laboratory plasma, \(L_A/\hat{r}\simeq\mathcal{O}(10^3)\), we
have \(\omega_0 t_0\simeq\mathcal{O}(10^2)\), suggesting that it is
reasonable to anticipate, in the presence of SAW continuous spectrum,
the appearance of KAW in such plasmas.

The main mode identification method for KAWs is based on the measurement
of the wave polarization,
\(|c\delta\mathbf{E}_\perp/v_A\delta\mathbf{B}_\perp|\). Observations
can be found from \emph{Van Allen Probes} in the Earth's inner
magnetosphere and the \emph{Cluster} satellites in the solar wind.

\hypertarget{nonlinear-gyrokinetics}{%
\subsection{Nonlinear Gyrokinetics}\label{nonlinear-gyrokinetics}}

The idea of deriving the gyrokinetic equations is very similar to the
derivation of 5/10-moment equations. Extra care is needed because of the
coordinate transformation to the guiding center coordinates. For species
\(\alpha\),

\[
\frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial\mathbf{x}} + \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha}\Big( \mathbf{E}+\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}}{c} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = \sum_{\alpha^\prime} C_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}(f_\alpha, f_\alpha^\prime)
\]

We expand \(f\) in different orders:

\[
f = f_0 + \delta f = f_0 + f_1 + f_2 + ...
\]

and treat the velocity as a first order quantity. For simplicity, we now
ignore the species subscript \(\alpha\). Separating the equilibrium and
perturbation terms, we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \delta f}{\partial t} \\
&+ \mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f}{\partial\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{v}_\parallel\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f}{\partial\mathbf{x}} \\
&+ \frac{q}{m}\Big( \delta\mathbf{E}+\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0}{c} + \frac{\mathbf{v}\times\delta\mathbf{B}_0}{c} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial \mathbf{v}} + \frac{q}{m}\Big( \delta\mathbf{E}+\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0}{c}+\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\delta\mathbf{B}}{c} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = \\
&C(f_0, f_0) + C(f_0, \delta f) + C(\delta f, f_0) + C(\delta f, \delta f)
\end{aligned}
\]

Based on the gyrokinetic ordering,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial t} \sim \omega_{\text{heat}}f_0 \sim \epsilon^3\Omega f_0 \\
\frac{\partial \delta f}{\partial t}\sim \omega\delta f\sim \epsilon^2\Omega f_0 \\

\frac{q}{mc}(\mathbf{v}\times\delta\mathbf{B})\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f}{\partial\mathbf{v}}\sim\frac{q}{mc}v_{\text{th}}\delta B\frac{\delta f}{v_{\text{th}}}\sim\epsilon^2\Omega f_0
\end{aligned}
\]

\(\omega_{\text{heat}}\) is ???

The zeroth order equation is

\[
\frac{q}{mc}(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = \Omega(\mathbf{v}_\perp\times\hat{b}_0)\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = 0
\]

If we tranform to a cylindrical coordinates in velocity space
(Equation~\ref{eq:kmhd_cylindrical_vspace}), this can be written as

\[
(\mathbf{v}_\perp\times\hat{b}_0)\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = -\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial\theta} = 0
\]

This means that the equilibrium distribution function \(f_0\) does not
depend on the gyrophase, i.e.~is gyrotropic.

The first order equation is

\[
\mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f_1}{\partial\mathbf{x}} + \frac{q}{m}\Big( -\nabla_\perp\delta\phi+\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\delta\mathbf{B}}{c} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial\mathbf{v}} + \frac{q}{mc}(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f_1}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = C(f_0, f_0)
\]

Muliplying with \((1+\ln f_0)\) and integrating over phase space, we get

\[
\int \ln(f_0)C(f_0, f_0)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} = 0
\]

From the proof of Boltzmann's H-theorem, we conclude:

\[
\begin{aligned}
f_0 = f_{0,M}(v) = \frac{n_0}{\pi^{3/2}v_{\text{th}}^3}e^{-v^2/v_{\text{th}}^2} \\
C(f_{0,M}, f_{0,M}) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial f_{0,M}}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = -2f_{0,M}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{v_\text{th}^2} = -f_{0,M}m\frac{\mathbf{v}}{T}
\end{aligned}
\]

The equilibrium distribution is Maxwellian. The first order equation
thus becomes (???)

\[
\mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot\frac{\partial \delta f_1}{\partial\mathbf{x}} - \Omega\frac{\partial\delta f_1}{\partial\theta} = -f_{0,M}\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla_\perp\Big(\frac{q\delta\phi}{T}\Big)
\]

The solution to this is a combination of a homogeneous solution and a
particular solution. For the homogeneous part,

\[
\mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot\frac{\partial h}{\partial\mathbf{x}} - \Omega\frac{\partial h}{\partial\theta}\bigg\rvert_\mathbf{x} = 0,\, \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{r}_L,\quad \Omega\frac{\partial h}{\partial\theta}\bigg\rvert_\mathbf{X}=0
\]

For the particular part, the solution is

\[
-q\delta \phi(\mathbf{x},t)f_0(\mathbf{v})/T
\]

Thus the complete solution is

\[
\delta f_1(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t) = h(\mathbf{X},v_\parallel,v_\perp,t) - q\delta\phi(\mathbf{x},t)f_0(\mathbf{v})/T
\]

We still need an equation for \(h\) for closure. Therefore we have to go
to the second order equation

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial\delta f_1}{\partial t}+v_\parallel\hat{b}_0\cdot\nabla\delta f_1 + \frac{q}{m}\Big( -\nabla_\perp \delta\phi + \frac{\mathbf{v}\times\delta\mathbf{B}}{c} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial\delta f_1}{\partial\mathbf{v}} \\
- \frac{q}{m}(\nabla_\parallel \delta\phi)\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v_\parallel} - \frac{q}{mc}\frac{\partial\delta\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial \mathbf{v}} \\
+ \mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot\nabla\delta f_2 + \frac{q}{mc}(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}_0)\cdot\frac{\partial\delta f_2}{\partial\mathbf{v}} \\
= C(\delta f_1, f_0) + C(f_0,\delta f_1)
\end{aligned}
\]

From particle coordinates to guiding center coordinates

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{X}}{\mathrm{d}t}\cdot\frac{\partial h}{\partial\mathbf{X}} + \frac{q}{m}\Big( -\nabla_\perp\delta\phi + \frac{\mathbf{v}\times\delta\mathbf{B}}{c} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial h}{\partial\mathbf{v}} = \\
C(h,f_0) + C(f_0, h) + \frac{q}{T}f_0\frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t} + \Omega\frac{\partial\delta f_2}{\partial\theta}\bigg\rvert_\mathbf{X}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\xi\equiv\delta\phi - \mathbf{v}\cdot\delta\mathbf{A}/c\).

For any quantity \(Q\), the gyrophase averaging at fixed guiding center
position is

\[
\left< Q(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t) \right>_\mathbf{X} \equiv \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}Q\Big( \mathbf{X}-\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\hat{b}_0}{\Omega},\mathbf{v},t \Big)\mathrm{d}\theta
\]

We have

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left< h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},t) \right>_\mathbf{X} = h \\
\left< \mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot\nabla Q \right>_\mathbf{X} = -\Omega \left<  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial\theta}\bigg\rvert_\mathbf{X} \right>_\mathbf{X} = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

The equation for the gyrocenter distribution function \(h\) is then

\[
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + v_\parallel\hat{b}_0\cdot\frac{\partial h}{\partial\mathbf{X}} + \frac{c}{B_0}\Big( \hat{b}_0\times\frac{\partial\left<\chi\right>_\mathbf{X}}{\partial \mathbf{X}} \Big)\cdot\frac{\partial h}{\partial\mathbf{X}} = \left< C(h) \right>_\mathbf{X} + \frac{q}{T}f_0\frac{\partial <\chi>_\mathbf{X}}{\partial t}
\]

The quasi-neutrality \(\sum_\alpha q_\alpha\delta n_\alpha = 0\) now
becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_\alpha\Big[ -\frac{q_\alpha^2 n_{0\alpha}}{T_{0\alpha}}\delta\phi(\mathbf{x},t) + q_\alpha\int h_\alpha\Big( \mathbf{x}+\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\hat{b}_0}{\Omega_\alpha},\mathbf{v},t \Big)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \Big] = 0 \\
\sum_\alpha\Big( -\frac{q_\alpha^2 n_{0\alpha}}{T_{0\alpha}}\delta\phi(\mathbf{x},t) + q_\alpha \int <h_\alpha>\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}\Big) = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Last but not least we need the modified Ampère's law:

\[
\nabla\times\delta\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{4\pi}{c}\sum_\alpha q_\alpha
\]

The distribution function now depends on 6 variables,
\(f = f(\mathbf{X},v_\parallel,\mu;t)\). The Vlasov equation can be
written as

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{X}} + \dot{v_\parallel}\frac{\partial f}{\partial v_\parallel} = 0
\]

where \(\mathbf{X}\) is the gyrocenter position, \(v_\parallel\) is the
parallel velocity, and \(\mu\) is the magnetic moment. The appropriate
field equations are now

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{n_1}{n_0} &= \frac{\bar{n}_1}{n_0} - (1- |I_0^2|)\frac{e\phi_1}{T} + |eI_0I_1|\frac{B_{1\parallel}}{B} \\
\nabla_\perp^2 A_{1\parallel} &= -\frac{4\pi}{c}\sum\bar{J}_{1\parallel} \\
\frac{B_{1\parallel}}{B} &= -\sum \epsilon_\beta\Big( \frac{\bar{p}_{1\perp}}{n_0 T} + |xI_0I_1|\frac{e\phi_1}{T} + |x^2I_1^2|\frac{B_{1\parallel}}{B} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

These equations remove the irrelevant space-time scales and become
nonlinear 5D equations instead 6D.

\chapter{Field Line Resonance}\label{sec:flr}}

The resonant mode coupling is one of major physical processes in the
space plasmas including the magnetic reconnection and collisionless
shock wave. The field line resonance describes \emph{the resonant
interaction between compressional fast waves and shear Alfvén waves in a
non-uniform plasma} such as the Earth magnetosphere. The concept of this
resonant mode coupling was first outlined by Tsutomu Tamao in 1961 and
later discussed in his seminal paper on hydromagnetic coupling
resonances (Tamao, 1965). Experimental work by John Samson+ (1971) made
resonant mode coupling the current paradigm of planetary magnetospheric
ULF wave research. Thinking of magnetosphere as a microwave oven:
instead of heating food with microwaves, we heat Earth with EM waves.

\hypertarget{historial-review}{%
\section{Historial Review}\label{historial-review}}

Before 1950s, no people thought about the idea of standing waves in
space simply because a vacuum had been assumed. Right after the space
age began, Dungey proposed that standing Alfvén waves could be excited
on geomagnetic field lines.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ground observations have shown discrete frequencies for EM wave power.
  In the magnetosphere the Alfvén speed is typically
  \(\sim 1000\,\text{km/s}\), while typical periods of geomagnetic
  pulsations are 10-600 s. Thus typical wavelengths are
  \(10^4-10^6\,\text{km}\), or \(1-100\,\text{R}_E\), comparable with
  the size of the magnetosphere itself. So uniform plasma theory is
  clearly inadequate.
\item
  In the 1950s people realized that MHD waves of poloidal and toroidal
  modes can be coupled, and if we thought the modes as standing waves,
  we might explain the discrete frequencies. However, good agreements
  were not found because there were poor estimates of the magnetospheric
  plasma density.
\item
  In the 1960s, {[}Sugiura 1961{]} showed that waves are observed
  simultaneously at both ends of the same field line, which indicated
  that the waves were guided. {[}Nagata+ 1963{]} showed pulsations at
  conjugate points could be matched cycle for cycle. The phase
  comparison could indicate the possible harmonics of standing waves.
  {[}Patel 1965{]} reported discovery of both transverse and
  compressional waves in space from Explorer 12 magnetometer data that
  are correlated with ground measurements, confirming that they were the
  same. {[}Cummings+ 1969{]} showed long-lived and frequent waves with
  nice numerical comparison of their periods from the poloidal and
  toroidal mode equations.
\item
  In the 1970s a simpler box model was proposed to explain field line
  resonance. The idea of standing waves could not explain why only some
  field lines are preferentially excited (with the foot point of the
  field line near magnetic latitude \(70^o\)). In the box model,
  discrete frequencies are treated as sources that reflect the
  properties of the magnetopause thickness with a preferred KHI growth
  rate.
\item
  In the 1980s the cavity model was proposed to link the discrete
  frequencies to the eigenmodes if we treated the magnetosphere as a
  cavity.
\item
  In the 1985s the waveguide model was proposed based on the cavity idea
  to loose the constrain in the azimuthal direction. This could explain
  many ground observation of discrete frequency, large amplitude Pc5
  waves but satellite measurements often saw small amplitude Pc3/4
  waves. Unlike field line resonances, which are described by a single
  eigennumber (\(k_z\)), cavity modes have three eigennumbers,
  corresponding to the number of wavelengths along a field line
  (\(k_z\)), azimuthally around the Earth (\(k_y\)), and radially
  between the magnetopause (or bow shock) and the inner reflection point
  (\(n\)). It is argued in the 1990s that if the lowest order mode has a
  frequency of, say, 2 mHz, then above perhaps 10 mHz the higher order
  modes will be so numerous and close in frequency that they could
  probably not be resolved in the data given their inherent width and
  the frequency resolution of a typical spectrum. Rather they would
  appear as a continuum. As a continuum, they can not be responsible for
  exciting discrete frequencies in this higher frequency band
  (corresponding to Pc3/4). Maybe the waveguide model is only relevant
  to Pc5 pulsations?
\end{itemize}

Now, the big question is: where do the quantized numbers of the observed
ULF waves come from {[}Kivelson \& Southwood, 1986{]}?Researchers
borrowed ideas from ionospheric radio propagation, laser fusion and
plasma physics and came up with the names \emph{cavity} and
\emph{waveguide}. For the box model that we will discuss in the next
section, if the \(z\) boundaries are perfectly reflecting, wave fields
must have standing structure in the \(z\) direction, and allowed
parallel wave numbers are quantized (\(k_z = m\pi/c\), as in
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_xz_quantized}). If the boundaries are weakly
absorptive, the parallel wave numbers are complex, but the real parts
are still quantized as above. If we impose periodic boundary conditions
in \(y\), the wavenumber in \(y\) \(k_y\) needs to be quantized as well.

Another question: if these discretized frequencies correspond to
standing waves propagating along the field lines, at the footprints
(i.e.~ground measurements) the amplitudes shall be the smallest? Why are
we still able to observe that on the ground?

\hypertarget{theory}{%
\section{Theory}\label{theory}}

The theory starts from linearized cold MHD
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_e_wave} and Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_b_wave}.

\hypertarget{axisymmetric-spherical-coordinates}{%
\subsection{Axisymmetric Spherical
Coordinates}\label{axisymmetric-spherical-coordinates}}

First, let's treat the problem in spherical coordinates
\((r,\theta,\phi)\), as done by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-radoski1966}{Radoski \& Carovillano, 1966}).

The background density is taken to be only a function of the radial
distance, \(\rho = \rho(r)\). In the analysis below the perturbed
variables, \(\mathbf{B}_1\), \(\mathbf{E}\), \(\mathbf{j}\) and
\(\mathbf{u}\) are treated as axisymmetric, i.e.~in spherical
coordinates any perturbed function has the form

\[
\mathbf{\delta} = \delta_r(r,\theta)\hat{r} + \delta_\theta(r,\theta)\hat{\theta} + \delta_\phi(r,\theta)\hat{\phi}
\]

Under this symmetry, the variables can be separated into two independent
sets referred to as the \emph{toroidal} and \emph{poloidal} variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Toroidal variables
\end{itemize}

\(B_{1\phi}, E_r, E_\theta, u_\phi, j_r, j_\theta;\, \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial \phi}\equiv 0\)
(incompressible)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Poloidal variables
\end{itemize}

\(B_{1r}, B_{1\theta}, E_\phi, u_r, u_\theta, j_\phi ;\, \nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial E_\phi}{\partial \phi}\equiv 0\)

The name of the set were originally based on the magnetic field
perturbation directions. One insight into these two sets of variables
can be gained from the Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\). The simplest MHD
Ohm's law constrains the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) to be
perpendicular to the background magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_0\). For the
toroidal mode, \(\mathbf{E}\) lies in a meridional plane and
\(B_{1\phi}\) is out of plane, so \(\mathbf{S}\) is directed along the
field lines. For the poloidal mode, \(\mathbf{S}\) is in a meridional
plane and parallel to the wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\), because

\[\mathbf{B}_1 = -i\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E}\Rightarrow \mathbf{S}\parallel\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}_1 \parallel \mathbf{E}\times(\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{E})=E^2\mathbf{k} - \cancel{(\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{k})}\mathbf{E} \parallel \mathbf{k}
\]

for a transverse EM wave (\(\mathbf{E}\perp\mathbf{k}\)). Thus the
toroidal mode is an Alfvén mode with dispersion relation
\(\omega = V_A k \cos\theta\), \(\mathbf{S} \parallel \mathbf{B}_0\),
while poloidal mode is a fast mode with dispersion relation
\(\omega = V_A k\), \(\mathbf{S} \parallel \mathbf{k}\).

To clarify my early misunderstanding: \emph{a toroidal mode is not
propagating in the toroidal direction}! Similarly, \emph{a poloidal mode
does not propagate in the poloidal direction}. In fact, it is more
common to have a fast poloidal mode propagating in the azimuthal
direction, then coupling to the Alfvén toroidal mode along the ambient
magnetic field direction, then being observed on the ground.

For the axisymmetric poloidal electric field
\(E_\phi \sim e^{i\omega t}\), Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_e_wave} becomes
(I HAVEN`T DERIVED THIS!)

\[
B_0^2[\nabla^2 - (r^2 \sin^2\theta)^{-1}] E_\phi = -\mu_0 \rho \omega^2 E_\phi
\]

This is the decoupled poloidal wave equation. For a dipole field,
\(B_0^2 = \frac{M^2(1+3\mu^2)}{r^6}\), where \(M\) is the magnetic
moment and \(\mu = \cos\theta\) is the colatitude. A solution for
\(E_\phi\) is sought after a separation of the unknowns of the form

\[
E_\phi = \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} f_l(r) P_l^m(\mu)
\]

where \(P_l^m\) is the associated Legendre function with integer indices
\(l\) and \(m\). Why this form you may ask? It's a mathematical
hypothesis based on experience and talents. With this representation the
poloidal wave equation becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:poloidal_spherical_assump}{}{
\sum_{l=1}^{\infty}[(1+3\mu^2)O_l + 2K^2] f_l P_l^m = 0
}\label{eq:poloidal_spherical_assump}\end{equation}

where
\(K^2 = \frac{\mu_0 \rho}{2}\big( \frac{\omega^2 r^2}{M^2}\big)^2\)
(maybe the coefficient is wrong) and \(O_l\) is the spherical Bessel
operator

\[
O_l = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}r - \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}
\]

(This is almost out of my control now. If I want to fully understand
this, I need to go back to math equations for physics!!!) The special
property of Legendre polynomials allows us to write the solution to the
wave equation as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:poloidal_spherical_sol}{}{
\sum_{s = 0,\pm 2} a_{l+s} O_{l+s} f_{l+s} + K^2 f_l = 0
}\label{eq:poloidal_spherical_sol}\end{equation}

where the constants coefficients are

\[
\begin{aligned}
a_{l+2} &= \frac{3(l+2)(l+3)}{2(2l+3)(2l+5)} \\
a_{l} &= \frac{5l(l+1)-6}{(2l-1)(2l+3)} \\
a_{l-2} &= \frac{3(l-2)(l-1)}{2(2l-3)(2l-1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

From Equation~\ref{eq:poloidal_spherical_sol}, we know that radial
amplitudes of opposite parity do not couple. Since only \(l\ge 1\)
occurs in Equation~\ref{eq:poloidal_spherical_assump}, there are two
fundamental unknown radial amplitudes: one for odd \(l\) and one for
even \(l\).

We assume perfect reflection at the boundaries so that the transverse
components of \(E\), i.e.~\(E_\theta\) and \(E_\phi\), are zeros. The
walls are assumed to be rigid so that \(u_r = 0\). The normal component
of \(\mathbf{B}_1\) also vanishes from the governing equations.

The toroidal wave equation seems to be too complicated for me following
Radoski's derivations\ldots{}

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:flr_harmonics}{%

lowest frequency toroidal modes (left) and poloidal modes (right). On
the left the field line is drawn stretched out from north to south, and
we look towards the Earth as the field line is displaced east and west.
On the right, the dipolar field line is displaced within its meridian
plane so all magnetic perturbations are radial. Note that for the
toroidal mode, the magnetic perturbations (AD) have the opposite sense
north and south in the fundamental and the same sense in the second
harmonic. The opposite is true of the AH perturbation in the poloidal
mode.}\label{fig:flr_harmonics}
}
\end{figure}

From the boundary condition, the length \(l\) of the field line between
two reflection point must be a multiple of half the wavelength
\(\lambda\), implying

\[
n\lambda = 2l,\quad n = 1,2,3,...
\]

From the dispersion relation, with the average Alfvén speed \(<V_A>\),
one finds:

\[
\omega_n = <V_A> k = <V_A>\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \frac{n\pi<V_A>}{l}
\]

\hypertarget{cylindrical-coordinates}{%
\subsection{Cylindrical Coordinates}\label{cylindrical-coordinates}}

In cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi,z)\), assuming perturbations of the
form \(e^{i(m\phi - \omega t)}\), we can separate the linearized
equations ((\protect\hyperlink{ref-hughes1994}{Hughes, 1994}) I HAVEN'T
DERIVED THIS!),

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cylindrical_mhd_toroidal}{}{
\Big[ \omega^2 \mu_0 \rho - \frac{1}{r}(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla)r^2(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla) \Big]\frac{u_\phi}{r} = \omega m \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{r}
}\label{eq:cylindrical_mhd_toroidal}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cylindrical_mhd_poloidal}{}{
\Big[\omega^2 \mu_0 \rho - rB^2 (\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla)\frac{1}{r^2 B^2}(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla) \Big]rE_\phi = i\omega B^2 (\mathbf{B}_0\times\nabla)_\phi \Big( \frac{\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1}{B^2} \Big)
}\label{eq:cylindrical_mhd_poloidal}\end{equation}

\[
i\omega \mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{1}{r}(\mathbf{B}\times\nabla)_\phi (rE_\phi) - imB^2\frac{u_\phi}{r}
\]

The first two equations are from the momentum equation.
\(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\nabla\) is the derivative along the direction of
\(\mathbf{B}\). These are wave equations coupled by the terms on the RHS
which depend on \(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1\), the compressional
part of the magnetic perturbation. The third equation is from Faraday's
law and Ohm's law. It shows how \(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1\),
\(E_\phi\) and \(u_\phi\) are related and closes the set. Since the
transverse dispersion relation depends only on \(k_\parallel\), it is
tempting to think of the LHS of
Equation~\ref{eq:cylindrical_mhd_toroidal} and
Equation~\ref{eq:cylindrical_mhd_poloidal} as representing
pseudo-transverse mode oscillations, and the RHS as representing the
coupling due to the fast mode which has a compressional component. When
\(m\neq 0\), the phase variation of the toroidal mode in the \(\phi\)
direction leads to a compressional perturbation in the magnetic field.
The polarizations of the toroidal and poloidal oscillations are no
longer orthogonal, and thus there is coupling.

If \(m = 0\) the RHS of Equation~\ref{eq:cylindrical_mhd_toroidal}
vanishes. The LHS then describes a mode in which the electric field is
purely radial and the magnetic and velocity perturbations are azimuthal.
Magnetic L shells decouple and each shell oscillates azimuthally
independently of each other. This is the Alfvénic \emph{toroidal} mode.
If \(m\rightarrow\infty\), for the RHS to remain finite,
\(\mathbf{B}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_1\rightarrow0\) so the RHS of
Equation~\ref{eq:cylindrical_mhd_poloidal} vanishes.
Equation~\ref{eq:cylindrical_mhd_poloidal} then describes a mode in
which \(\mathbf{E}\) is azimuthal and \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\)
are contained in a meridian plane. This is the compressional
\emph{poloidal} mode.

\hypertarget{cartesian-box-model}{%
\subsection{Cartesian Box Model}\label{cartesian-box-model}}

Earliest theories had cold ideal MHD equations
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_e_wave} or Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_b_wave}
expressed in the spherical or cylindrical coordinates, which are not
easy to solve. As we will see, the essence of FLR can be obtained in the
Cartesian coordinates. We simplify the actual dayside magnetosphere,
which like a compressed dipole, to something we can solve analytically.
Imagine a field line with both footpoints connecting to the conducting
ionosphere, we can map this curved field line into a straight line
extending along \(z\). In the \(x\)-direction, the outer boundary is the
magnetopause, and the inner boundary is the reflection point
(plasmapause or ionosphere). The \(y\)-direction represents the
azimuthal direction, therefore at the front of the magnetosphere it is
more aligned with the \(y\)-direction in GSE/GSM and at the flanks/sides
it is more aligned with the \(x\)-direction. If the length in \(y\) is
finite (\(b < \infty\)), we call it a \emph{cavity}; if the length in
\(y\) is infinite (\(b\rightarrow \infty\)), we call it a
\emph{waveguide}. The names cavity and waveguide are inherited from
electrodynamics. This is shown in the schematic
Figure~\ref{fig:box_mapping} and Figure~\ref{fig:box_config}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:box_mapping}{%

}
\end{figure}

Along the \(z\)-direction, we impose the ionospheric boundary for closed
field lines \(u_x = u_y = B_{1z} = 0\). Because of the ideal MHD
assumption, the electric field along the field lines \(E_z = 0\). In the
\(y\)-direction, we impose either a periodic boundary condition for the
cavity model that leads to a quantized wavenumber \(k_y\), or a infinite
boundary. In the \(x\) direction, the boundaries are provided by large
\(V_A\) gradients at both the outer boundary \(x_m\) (magnetopause) and
the inner boundary \(x_t\) (plasmapause). We impose a reflective
boundary \(u_x = 0\) at \(x = x_t, x_m\). \emph{The inhomogeity in \(x\)
means that we can only consider Fourier components in the \(y\) and
\(z\) directions}. Therefore, we seek wave modes of the form
\(\propto \exp[i(k_y y + k_z z - \omega t)]\) with the ansatz

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{k} &= (0, k_y, k_z) \\
\mathbf{E} &= (E_x(x), E_y(x), 0) e^{i(k_y y + k_z z - \omega t)} \\
\mathbf{B}_1 &= (B_{1x}, B_{1y}, B_{1z}) e^{i(k_y y + k_z z - \omega t)} \\
\mathbf{B}_0 &= B_z \hat{z} = B\hat{z} \\
\rho &= \rho(x) \\
\mathbf{u} &= \mathbf{u}_0 + \mathbf{u}_1 = \mathbf{u}_1
\end{aligned}
\]

The linearized momentum Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold} gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho\Big(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \cancel{\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}}\Big) &= \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B} \\
\rho\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} &= \frac{1}{\mu_0}(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B}
\end{aligned}
\]

Separating the two perpendicular \(x\) and \(y\) directions and applying
plane wave decomposition,

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega\rho\mu_0 u_x &= (\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)_y B_z - (\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)_z \cancel{B_y} \\
&= \Big(\frac{\partial B_{1x}}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial x}\Big) B \\
&= -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big( B B_{1z} \Big) + i k_z B B_{1x}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega\rho\mu_0 u_y &= (\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)_z \cancel{B_x} - (\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_1)_x B_z \\
&= \Big(\frac{\partial B_{1y}}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial y}\Big) B \\
&= k_z B B_{1y} - k_y B B_{1z}
\end{aligned}
\]

From the simplest form of the generalized Ohm's law
\(\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{u}_1 \times\mathbf{B}_0\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
E_x &= - u_y B \\
E_y &= - u_x B
\end{aligned}
\]

Inserting into the linearized momentum equation, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_momentum}{}{
\begin{aligned}
-i \omega \rho \mu_0 \frac{E_y}{B} &= -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big( B B_{1z} \Big) + i k_z B B_{1x} \\
\omega \rho \mu_0 \frac{E_x}{B} &= - k_y B B_{1z} + k_z B B_{1y}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:flr_momentum}\end{equation}

From linearized Faraday's law
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\dot{\mathbf{B}_1}\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
-\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial z} &= -\dot{B_{1x}} \\
\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial z} &= -\dot{B_{1y}} \\
\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial y} &= -\dot{B_{1z}}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_faraday_linear}{}{
\begin{aligned}
B_{1x} &= \frac{1}{\omega}(- k_z E_y) \\
B_{1y} &= \frac{1}{\omega}(k_z E_x) \\
B_{1z} &= \frac{1}{\omega}\Big(-i\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} - k_y E_x\Big)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:flr_faraday_linear}\end{equation}

Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:flr_faraday_linear} into
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_momentum} gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i \omega \rho \mu_0 \frac{E_y}{B} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big[ B  \frac{1}{\omega}\Big(-i\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} - k_y E_x\Big) \Big] + i k_z B \frac{-k_z}{\omega} E_y \\
-i \big( \omega^2 \rho \mu_0 / B^2 - k_z^2 \big)E_y = k_y \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial^2 E_y}{\partial x^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
-i \omega \rho \mu_0 \frac{E_x}{B} = k_z B \frac{k_z}{\omega} E_x - k_y B \frac{1}{\omega}\Big(-i\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} - k_y E_x\Big) \\
\big( \omega^2 \rho \mu_0 / B^2 - k_y^2 - k_z^2 \big)E_x + i k_y\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Let \(R^2 = \mu_0 \rho(x) \omega^2 / B^2 = \omega^2/V_A(x)^2\), we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_ex_ey}{}{
\begin{aligned}
-i (R^2 - k_z^2)E_y = k_y \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial^2 E_y}{\partial x^2} \\
(R^2 - k_y^2 -k_z^2)E_x + i k_y\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} = 0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:flr_ex_ey}\end{equation}

Eliminating \(E_x\) from Equation~\ref{eq:flr_ex_ey} gives

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_wave_ey}{}{
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}E_y - k_y^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x}R^2(x)\frac{1}{(R^2 - k_z^2)(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2)}\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} + (R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2)E_y = 0
}\label{eq:flr_wave_ey}\end{equation}

There is a very important observation about polarization from
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_ex_ey},
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-southwood1974some}{Southwood, 1974}):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_polarization}{}{
\frac{E_x}{E_y} = -\frac{ik_y}{R^2-k_y^2-k_z^2}\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x}\frac{1}{E_y}
}\label{eq:flr_polarization}\end{equation}

Our familiar fast MHD wave is \emph{no longer linearly polarized in a
nonuniform plasma}! A key thing on the RHS is the dependence on the sign
of \(k_y\) as well as \(\partial E_y/\partial x\). For fast waves
propagating in opposite directions (i.e.~eastward and westward in the
azimuthal direction), the sense of polarization (RH, LH) will change as
\(k_y\) changes sign across local noon. Right at the resonance point
where \(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 = 0\), we get linearly polarized Alfvén
wave. \(\partial E_y/\partial x\) changes sign across the resonance
point, thus we also have another change in polarization detected on the
ground for different L-shells (or magnetic latitudes).

\begin{figure}

}
\end{figure}

Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_ey} can also be written as a second order
differential equation of \(B_{1z}\), the compressional component of the
magnetic field (see Equation~\ref{eq:perturb_b}), as
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivelson1985resonant}{Kivelson \& Southwood,
1985}) did in proposing the idea of cavity modes:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\partial x^2} - \frac{ \frac{\partial R^2}{\partial x}}{R^2 - k_z^2}\frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial x} + ( R^2 - k_y^2 - k_z^2 ) B_{1z} = 0
\]

or equivalently,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_wave_bz}{}{
\frac{\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\partial x^2} - \frac{\omega^2 \partial V_A^{-2}/\partial x}{\omega^2/V_A^2 - k_z^2}\frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial x} + \Big( \frac{\omega^2}{V_A^2} - k_y^2 - k_z^2 \Big) B_{1z} = 0
}\label{eq:flr_wave_bz}\end{equation}

Let us first get some intuitions about Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_ey}
(following (\protect\hyperlink{ref-glassmeier1999}{Glassmeier et al.,
1999}), but note that there are sign errors and wrong equations in the
original paper!). This equation exhibits strong singularities found in
the denominator of its second term, much as first described by Tamao
(1965). The following solutions are possible. If
\(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 > 0\), from which \(R^2 - k_z^2 > 0\) follows, no
singularities appear. Assuming \(k_y \approx 0\), the above equation
reduces to

\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}E_y + (R^2 - k_z^2)E_y = 0
\]

For a linear density profile, i.e.~\(R^2 = \alpha_0^2 + \alpha^2 x\),
with the definition of the turning point \(x_t\) via \(R^2 = k_z^2\),
and the transformation \(s = \alpha^{2/3}(x-x_t)>0\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial E_y}{\partial(\alpha^{-2/3}s+x_t)} = \alpha^{2/3}\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial s} \\
\frac{\partial^2 E_y}{\partial x^2} &=  \alpha^{4/3}\frac{\partial^2 E_y}{\partial s^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\frac{\partial^2 E_y}{\partial s^2} + sE_y = 0
\]

This is the Airy or Stokes equation (Section~\ref{sec:airy}) with the
two principal solutions displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:airy_flr}. The
solution \(Bi(s)\) is unphysical as it implies unlimited growth of
\(E_y\) behind the turning point at \(s=0\). Thus \(E_y(s) = Ai(s)\) is
the required solution. The turning point actually is the point of total
reflection of the wave field. Its appearance can be understood on the
following grounds. The ``effective'' local wavenumber in \(x\) is given
by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_kx_effective}{}{
k_x^2(x, \omega) = \frac{\omega^2}{V_A^2(x)} - k_y^2 - k_z^2
}\label{eq:flr_kx_effective}\end{equation}

If \(V_A^2\) increases with \(x\), that is with \(s\) in the Airy
function plot, \(k_x^2\) has to decrease as \(\omega, k_y\) and \(k_z\)
stay constant. Eventually \(k_x^2\) may become negative, which implies
an imaginary wave number \(k_x\). At this turning point the wave will be
reflected.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:airy_flr}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{_build/im/KeyNotes_plot_airy_minus_x_.png}
\caption{Airy functions solutions for the simplified field line
resonance equation.}\label{fig:airy_flr}
}
\end{figure}

Next if \(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 < 0\), \(R^2 - k_z^2 = 0\) may occur.
Assuming again a linear density profile, defining a resonance point
\(x_r\) via \(R^2 = k_z^2\), and \(s = x-x_r\), the electric field
perturbation transforms close to the resonance point \(x - x_r = 0\)
into

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_wave_ey_perturbation}{}{
\frac{\partial^2 E_y}{\partial s^2} - \frac{1}{s}\frac{s_t}{s-s_t}\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial s} + \alpha^2(s-s_t) E_y = 0
}\label{eq:flr_wave_ey_perturbation}\end{equation}

where \(s_t = k_y^2/\alpha^2\).

At the resonance point its solution exhibits a clear singularity with
unlimited growth of \(E_y\). In front of the turning point \(s>s_t\) the
solution is similar to an Airy function, while behind it singular
behaviour is observed at the resonance point \(s=0\). I do not show the
solution BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE IT DOWN! But let us now
follow (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivelson1985resonant}{Kivelson \&
Southwood, 1985}) and check the equivalent perturbation
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_bz} for \(B_{1z}\).

When we also assume linear mass density variation with \(x\) in
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_bz} such that

\[
\begin{aligned}
R^2 - k_z^2 &= \alpha^2(x - x_r) \\
R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 &= \alpha^2(x-x_t)
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(x_r = k_z^2/\alpha^2\), \(x_t = x_r + k_y^2/\alpha^2\), we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_bz_perturbation}{}{
\frac{\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\partial x^2} - \frac{1}{x-x_r}\frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial x} + \alpha^2(x-x_t)B_{1z} = 0
}\label{eq:flr_bz_perturbation}\end{equation}

The solution of Equation~\ref{eq:flr_bz_perturbation} is discussed by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivelson1986coupling}{Kivelson \& Southwood,
1986}). The singular point where \(x=x_r\) and \(R^2=k_z^2\) corresponds
to the \emph{resonance point} where the wave frequency matches the
Alfvén mode frequency. The point where \(x=x_t\) and
\(R^2=k_y^2 + k_z^2\) is the \emph{turning point} of the equation. When
\(x>x_t\), any wave described by the equation oscillates with \(x\);
when \(x<x_t\) independent solutions grow or evanesce with \(x\) on each
side of the resonance singularity \(x_r\).

Series solutions valid in the neighborhood of \(x=x_r\) and \(x=x_t\)
have been derived by a variety of authors. The Frobenius method of
solution of partial differential equations can be used to find solutions
valid near \(x_r\), where the analytic solution is of the form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_bz_analytic}{}{
R_t(x) = k_y^2(x-x_r)^2 + \mathcal{O}[(x-x_r)^4]
}\label{eq:flr_bz_analytic}\end{equation}

and the singular solution is of the form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_bz_singular}{}{
s_t(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}R_t(x)\ln(x_r - x) + \mathcal{O}[(x-x_r)^2]
}\label{eq:flr_bz_singular}\end{equation}

For \(k_y^2=\alpha^{4/3}\), the two solutions for \(B_{1z}\) is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:flr_b1z_solutions}. On the far right side of the plot
the functions are close to spatial quadrature and have zeros whose
spacing decreases with increasing \(x\). In this regime, as we will
mention later, the WKB approximation is good and the amplitude and phase
are proportional to \(s^{1/4}\) and \(s^{3/2}\), respectively. The
amplitudes have been plotted just such that an incoming wave from large
\(x\) would be represented by \(R_t(x)+iS_t(x)\) if a time variation
\(e^{-i\omega t}\) is specified. The corresponding mode propagating
toward large \(x\) would be \(R_t(x)-iS_t(x)\). Thus \(R_t(x), S_t(x)\)
represent standing wave forms. However, the presence of the resonance
(at the far left of the plots) preludes there being perfect reflection
or perfect standing wave solutions.

The following physical interpretation is tempting. The MHD wave
propagating into the magnetosphere is a fast mode wave generated by,
e.g.~plasma instabilities at the magnetopause. Eventually the wave
reaches the turning point where reflection occurs. If conditions are
favourable, that is if a resonance point occurs, part of the fast mode
wave energy can tunnel into the resonance, where coupling from the fast
mode disturbance into an Alfvén mode perturbation takes place. The
resonance point \emph{always} lies beyond the turning point, but energy
tunnels to the resonance point and the reflection is found to be less
than perfect. This scenario is schematically shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:flr_schematic}, where the reflection or turning point is
assumed to coincide with the magnetopause. The point of maximum coupling
or ``resonant mode coupling'' is given by
\(\omega = k_\parallel V_A(x)\), where \(\omega\) is the fast mode wave
frequency, \(k_\parallel\) is the field-aligned component of the fast
mode wave vector and \(V_A(x)\) is the local Alfvén velocity. This is
also the Alfvén dispersion relation.

Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_bz} has a long history that appeared first in
the context of a radio wave obliquely incident on a region of increasing
electron density, all the way back to 1951, as mentioned in
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivelson1986coupling}{Kivelson \& Southwood,
1986}). It also appears in calculating the absorption of laser energy by
a plasma and heating a plasma by radio wave injection to excite internal
Alfvén waves. Energy is absorbed at the location in the plasma
corresponding to the singular point of the governing differential
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_bz} or its equivalent. Without the
introduction of additional effects such as dissipation or dispersion
near resonance, the singularity in the differential equation implies
that the amplitude of the Alfvén wave grows secularly.

Some studies (e.g.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivelson1986coupling}{Kivelson \& Southwood,
1986}), (\protect\hyperlink{ref-wright1994}{Wright, 1994})) prefer to
use plasma displacement \(\pmb{\xi}\) instead of \(\mathbf{u}\), where
\(\mathbf{u} = \dot{\pmb{\xi}}\), and perturbed magnetic field component
\(B_{1z}\) to describe the model:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_box_displacement_b1z}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{V_A^2}\frac{\partial^2 \xi_x}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial \xi_x}{\partial z^2} &= -\frac{1}{B_0}\frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial x} \\
\frac{1}{V_A^2}\frac{\partial^2 \xi_y}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial \xi_y}{\partial z^2} &= -\frac{1}{B_0}\frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial y} \\
B_{1z} &= - B_0 \Big( \frac{\partial \xi_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \xi_y}{\partial y} \Big)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:flr_box_displacement_b1z}\end{equation}

This equation set is equivalent to Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_cold_b_wave}.
The first two equations are the \(x\) and \(y\) component of the
momentum equation, and the last equation is the magnetic field advection
equation (Faraday's law + Ohm's law). Recall that \(B_{1z}\) is the
compressional perturbation to the ambient magnetic field. Then on the
RHS of the second equation, it is the azimuthal gradient in the fast
mode \(\partial B_{1z}/\partial y\) that drives the response in the
azimuthal place displacement \(\xi_y\). It is like the LHS is a simple
harmonic oscillator and the RHS is the forcing term. Recall that we are
seeking for solutions of the form \(e^{i(k_y y + k_z z - \omega t)}\).
From here we can see that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if \(k_y=0\) for the fast mode, then there are no azimuthal gradients
  to drive FLRs and hence you get no wave coupling;
\item
  if \(k_y \rightarrow \infty\), then \(\xi_y \rightarrow 0\) and
  \(\xi_x\) describes a decoupled poloidal Alfvén wave.
\item
  if \(k_y \neq 0\) or \(\infty\), the wave modes are coupled together
  and energy initially in the fast mode may mode convert to Alfvén wave
  energy on localized field lines.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Uniform density and background magnetic field}

Let \(\rho = \text{const.}\), \(V_A = \text{const.}\). From
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_box_displacement_b1z},

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{B_{1z}} &= - B_0 \Big( \frac{\partial \ddot{\xi_x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \ddot{\xi_y}}{\partial y} \Big) = V_A^2 \Big( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \Big) B_{1z} \\ &= V_A^2 \nabla^2 B_{1z}
\end{aligned}
\]

Consider normal modes of waveguides of the form
\(e^{\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - i\omega t}\), where
\(\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)\). The dispersion relation for the fast
mode is then

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_uniform_fast}{}{
\omega^2 = V_A^2 (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)
}\label{eq:flr_uniform_fast}\end{equation}

In an infinite medium this relation gives nondispersive propagation.
Since we are interested primarily in propagation along the waveguide
(i.e., in the \(y\) direction) we shall define \(v_p\) and \(v_g\) to be
the phase and group velocities along \(\hat{y}\). Employing
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_uniform_fast} gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_p &= \frac{\omega}{k_y} = \frac{k}{k_y}V_A \\
v_g &= \frac{\partial\omega}{\partial k_y} = \frac{k_y}{k}V_A
\end{aligned}
\]

which yields the familiar waveguide relation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_waveguide_relation}{}{
v_p v_g = V_A^2
}\label{eq:flr_waveguide_relation}\end{equation}

The shear Alfvén wave has the same velocity parallel to the field line
(because it is cold). However, in a waveguide the boundary conditions in
the \(x\) and \(z\) directions restrict the choice of wavenumbers and
introduce dispersion. Suppose that the boundaries in \(x\) are perfectly
reflecting (e.g.~\(\xi_x = \frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial y} = 0\)) as
are those in \(z\) (\(\xi_x = \xi_y = B_{1z} = 0\)) which represent the
ionospheric boundary for closed field lines. Then

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_xz_quantized}{}{
\begin{aligned}
k_x &= \pm n \pi / a,\, &n = 1,2,3... \\
k_z &= \pm m \pi / c,\, &m = 1,2,3...
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:flr_xz_quantized}\end{equation}

where \(a\) is the box length in x and \(c\) is the box length in z
(i.e.~length of the field lines).

Given values of \(k_x\) and \(k_z\), we may use
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_uniform_fast} to find \(k_y\) as a function of
\(\omega\),

\[
k_y^2 = \frac{\omega^2}{V_A^2} - k_x^2 - k_y^2
\]

If \(k_y\) is real then the mode may propagate along the guide. However,
if we believe that the boundary at \(x = x_m = a\) is not a reflector
but is driven, it would be appropriate to impose a wavenumber \(k_y\)
along the outer boundary and solve for \(k_x\) given \(k_z\). This is
the case when the magnetopause is driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (i.e.~\(k_y\) given by the surface waves), which was
proposed in the 1970s to be the driver of field line resonances. In this
situation \(k_x\) is found to be imaginary, and the mode is evanescent
(exponentially decaying) in \(x\).

\textbf{Nonuniform density and magnetic field}

The simplest assumptions in this case would be \(\rho = \rho(x)\),
\(\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\hat{z}\), and that the Alfvén speed \(V_A\) is
monotonically decreasing with \(x\), \(\partial V_A / \partial x < 0\).
Then again we get Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_bz}. Solving this equation
for given boundary conditions in \(x\) yields a set of orthogonal
eigenfunctions \(B_{1z}(x)\) and eigenfrequencies.

First of all, we shall notice that a singularity/resonance occurs at
\(x_r\) where

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_resonance_dispersion}{}{
\omega^2 = k_z^2 V_A^2(x_r)
}\label{eq:flr_resonance_dispersion}\end{equation}

Across \(x_r\) there will be a \(180^o\) phase shift for the perturbed
terms (Equation~\ref{eq:flr_polarization}). Energy is been absorbed at
the resonance point from fast mode to Alfvén mode. Dissipation is
required, otherwise the amplitude of the Alfvén wave grows secularly.
Ionospheric dissipation near the resonant field line is likely to be one
important process limiting the growth of the resonance amplitude.

Secondly, there is a turning point at \(x_t\) defined via \(k_x^2 = 0\)
(fixed \(k_y, k_z, \omega\)):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_turning_dispersion}{}{
\omega^2 = (k_y^2 + k_z^2)V_A^2(x_t)
}\label{eq:flr_turning_dispersion}\end{equation}

On the right of \(x_t\), the positive exponent represents a wave
propagating in the positive \(x\) direction towards the magnetopause,
and the negative exponent represents one propagating away from the
magnetopause. This is like an imperfect standing wave solution. Across
\(x_t\) on the left, the oscillating solutions convert to a decaying
solution and an exponentially growing solution (Section~\ref{sec:airy}).

If the Alfvén speed \(V_A\) is monotonically decreasing with \(x\), from
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_resonance_dispersion} and
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_turning_dispersion} we always have
\(0 < x_r < x_t < x_m\). In the low Alfvén speed region \([x_t, x_m]\)
the fast mode may propagate, while in the high Alfvén speed region
\([0, x_t]\) the fast mode is evanescent. Thus the resonant singularity
\(x_r\) is in the evanescent tail of the fast mode.

The first-order derivative term in Equation~\ref{eq:flr_wave_bz}
dominate near \(x=x_r\), but is small in the propagating interval
\([x_t, x_m]\). This is particularly true in the WKB limit
(Section~\ref{sec:WKB}), where we consider waves of short wavelength in
\(x\); i.e.~second-order derivative term is much larger than the
first-order derivative term. In the lowest order WKB analysis we may
neglect the first-order derivatives and solve

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_wave_bz_wkb}{}{
\frac{\partial^2 B_{1z}}{\partial x^2} + \Big( \frac{\omega^2}{V_A^2} - k_y^2 - k_z^2 \Big) B_{1z} = 0
}\label{eq:flr_wave_bz_wkb}\end{equation}

and the WKB solution is given in the form

\[
B_{1z}(x) = A k_x^{-1/2} e^{i\int k_x dx} + B k_x^{-1/2}e^{-i\int k_x dx}
\]

where \(A\) and \(B\) are constants, and \(k_x\) is the ``effective''
wavenumber defined in Equation~\ref{eq:flr_kx_effective}, an explicit
function of \(x\).

The Bohr-Sommerfeld (or phase integral,
Section~\ref{sec:stokes_application}) condition which the quasi-standing
wave must satisfy between \(x_t\) and \(x_m\) is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb}{}{
\int_{x_t}^{x_m} k_x(x,\omega_n) dx = (n+\alpha)\pi\qquad n = 1,2,3...
}\label{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb}\end{equation}

where \(x_m = a\) is the location of the outer boundary in \(x\) and the
phase factor \(\alpha\) is determined by the boundary conditions in
\(x\). For a perfect reflector at \(a\) (\(\xi_x=0\)) and evanescent
decay at small x, we find \(\alpha = -1/4\). If there is a resonance in
the waveguide, it will modify \(\alpha\); however, since the resonance
is in the evanescent tail there will be no leading order change in
\(\alpha\).

Equation~\ref{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb} is an integral relation for the
eigenfrequencies of the fast mode: we specify \(k_y\), \(k_z\), and
\(n\) (the mode number in x), then find the n-th eigenfrequency
\(\omega_n\) as that frequency for which the criterion is met. Once we
compute \(\omega_n\), we can then compute the locations of the excited
field line \(x_r\) from Equation~\ref{eq:flr_resonance_dispersion}.
These are the most observable discrete modes.

\textbf{Driven FLR vs Cavity Modes vs Waveguide Modes}

The surface wave driven FLR seems reasonable. However, the biggest
problem for this hypothesis to be valid is that the mapped phase speeds
to the magnetopause were too high compared to in-situ measurements. In
addition, in spite of numerous magnetopause crossings by ISEE 1 and 2,
regular oscillations of the magnetopause corresponding to the
Kelvin-Helmholtz waves were not seen. These two facts indicated that we
should seek for a new explanation for the driver.

In the 1980s, cavity modes and waveguide modes were proposed to remove
the constraint on driven FLR. The analogy of a magnetosphere to a cavity
came before the analogy to a waveguide. In a cavity model the azimuthal
direction \(\phi\) or the \(y\) direction in the box geometry is finite,
and the wavenumber \(k_y\) is determined by the given scale size \(b\).
In the axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi,z)\), where
\(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle and \(z\) is the coordinate along the
field lines, the field has the form
\(\sim e^{im\phi},\, m=0,1,2\).\footnote{$E(\phi=0)=E(\phi=2\pi)$} This
is a weak point of the theory because the magnetosphere is far from
axisymmetric and there are no other obvious boundaries to define the
cavity. If the system is similar to a waveguide, then \(k_y\) can have a
continuum of values, and the waveguide allows propagation over a wide
band of frequencies.

If instead we use a waveguide model, the azimuthal direction (or
\(y\)-direction) will have no imposed boundary condition. Theoretically
a continuum of wave modes \(k_y\) can excite FLR, and the discrete
resonance frequencies are determined by the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition
eq:cavity\_eigen\_wkb where harmonics of toroidal and poloidal are given
by \(k_z\). The discrete frequency spectrum of the fast waveguide modes
is suitable for driving a series of Alfvén resonance; however, it is not
obvious that the continuous frequency spectrum of the modes will be able
to drive resonances at discrete frequencies. A key observation to make
waveguide mode more valid is that \emph{only small \(k_y\) contributes
to the resonance}. ((\protect\hyperlink{ref-walker1992spatial}{Walker et
al., 1992}),{[}Wright 1992{]},
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-wright1994}{Wright, 1994})). If \(k_y\) is not
fixed (but \(k_z\) is fixed), then Equation~\ref{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb} is
the dispersion relation for the waveguide expressing \(\omega\) as a
function of \(k_y\). The Alfvén speed is a strong function of the L
shell, typically \(\sim L^{-3}\). Thus, if the turning point \(x_t\) is
reasonably deep within the magnetosphere, the range over which
\(\omega^2/V_A^2 \gg k_y^2 + k_z^2\) contributes most significantly to
the integral Equation~\ref{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb}. The result is that over
a wide range of wavelengths the frequency is very insensitive to
\(k_y\). Only when \(k_y\) is quite large this is not true, and then the
turning point is near the magnetopause, and the wave does not penetrate
very deeply into the magnetosphere. Each waveguide mode has a phase
velocity \(\omega/k_y\) and a group velocity \(\mathrm{d}\omega/dk_y\).
Since Equation~\ref{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb} defines \(\omega\) as a
function of \(k_y\), we can substitute
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_kx_effective} into
Equation~\ref{eq:cavity_eigen_wkb} and differentiate with respect to
\(k_y\) (assuming \(\alpha\) is a constant):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial k_y}\int_{x_t}^{x_m}\Big(\frac{\omega^2}{V_A(x)^2}-k_y^2 - k_z^2\Big)^{1/2}dx = 0 \\
\int_{x_t}^{x_m}\frac{1}{2}k_x^{-1}\Big( \frac{1}{V_A^2}\frac{\partial \omega^2}{\partial k_y} - 2k_y \Big)dx = 0 \\
\frac{\omega}{k_y}\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial k_y}\int_{x_t}^{x_m}k_x^{-1}V_A^{-2}dx = \int_{x_t}^{x_m} k_x^{-1}dx
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
v_p v_g \equiv \frac{\omega}{k_y}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{dk_y} = \frac{\int_{x_t}^{x_m}k_x^{-1}dx}{\int_{x_t}^{x_m}V_A^{-2}k_x^{-1}dx}
\]

The RHS is the reciprocal of the weighted mean of \(V_A^{-2}\) with
weighting function \(k_x^{-1}\). Thus we can write

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:flr_waveguide_relation_modified}{}{
v_p v_g = \left<V_A^{-2}\right>^{-1}
}\label{eq:flr_waveguide_relation_modified}\end{equation}

In a uniform waveguide filled with plasma for which the Alfvén speed was
\(V_A\) the well-known waveguide relation
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_waveguide_relation} would be recovered. In this
more complicated case where the Alfvén speed is not constant throughout
the waveguide the RHS of
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_waveguide_relation_modified} is an appropriately
weight mean of \(V_A^{-2}\). In general the phase velocity \(v_p\) is
much larger than the mean Alfvén velocity in the guide, and the group
velocity \(v_g\) is much smaller. This is also consistent with the weak
dependence of \(\omega\) on \(k_y\) such that \(v_g\) is small. The
consequence is that even if the ends of the guide are open, the time
taken for energy to be propagated along it is long compared with the
period of the oscillations.

Therefore, the waveguide model proposes the following explanation.
Disturbances in the solar wind move along the magnetopause, producing a
disturbance on the boundary which is propagated tailward with speed
\(v_w\). Generally \(v_w \gg V_A\). Such a disturbance is likely to
excite waveguide modes with phase velocities equal to \(v_w\). Because
the frequency of the modes is very insensitive to \(k_y\), the same
frequencies (determined by eigenmodes in \(x\) and \(z\)) are excited no
matter what the velocity. The disturbance moving with the wave can feed
energy continuously into it. This then requires

\[
k_y = \frac{\omega}{v_w}
\]

i.e., \emph{the azimuthal wavenumber is determined by the velocity of
the source rather than by a boundary condition on \(y\)}. Thus we have a
discrete value of wavenumber and a discrete fast mode frequency
spectrum, without relying on the resonance modes from the cavity model.

Such a disturbance could arise from more than one type of source. If it
arose from an impulse in the solar wind, then one would expect the
waveguide response to be a ringing at the natural frequencies of its
modes with growth on the time scale required to establish the mode and
decay on the time scale for leakage to the resonance and loss in the
ionosphere or elsewhere. Alternatively the waveguide modes could be
excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In this case it could be
expected that the waveguide modes would all be excited continuously and
would be driven so long as the solar wind velocity and the
characteristics of the magnetopause were maintained.

\hypertarget{energy-consideration}{%
\section{Energy Consideration}\label{energy-consideration}}

???

The energy that is carried into the magnetosphere across the background
field by the non-guided fast mode is accumulated in the plane of
resonant mode coupling (i.e.~the y--z plane through \(x_r\) in
Figure~\ref{fig:box_config}) in the form of the guided Alfvén wave. It
is this localized accumulation of energy due to resonant mode coupling
between a non-guided mode and a guided mode that constitutes a field
line resonance. This wave energy accumulation can be described by

\[
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{S} = -h
\]

where \(w\) is the wave energy density, \(\mathbf{S}\) is the Poynting
flux, and \(h\) a dissipation term, describing energy loss due to
e.g.~ionospheric Joule heating. As the background parameters only vary
in the radial direction, this equation reduces to

\[
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}r}S_x - h
\]

Integration across the width of the coupling region in a radial
direction leads to the following rate equation:

\[
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = c_e S_{ng} - S_h^{\text{off}} - H
\]

where \(W\) is the energy per area that is being accumulated in the
coupling, \(c_e\) is a coupling efficiency, \(S_{ng}\) the incoming
Poynting flux of the non-guided mode, and \(S_g^{\text{off}}\) the
``off-angle'' component of the Poynting flux of that mode to which the
non-guided mode couples. Including this term \(S_g^{\text{off}}\) allows
us to consider energy losses due to coupling to not strictly guided
modes. A finite off-angle component of the coupled wave mode would
render the energy accumulation less efficient or may even inhibit the
build-up of a resonance. Off-angle components may arise if the
transverse scale of the coupled wave become small enough for finite ion
gyroradius or finite electron inertia becoming important. In this case
the coupled mode is a \emph{kinetic Alfvén mode}. The parameter \(c_e\)
denotes the coupling efficiency, that is the fraction of energy of the
non-guided mode that is converted into the guided mode. Finally, \(H\)
gives the dissipative losses, integrated in the \(x\) direction.

It is now instructive to evaluate the rate Equation for the ideal MHD
regime. As the Alfvén mode is a strictly guided mode its Poynting flux
is directed exactly parallel to the background magnetic field. In other
words, \(S_h^{\text{off}}=0\), and Equation reads

\[
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = c_e S_{\text{fast}}
\]

where \(S_{\text{fast}} = S_{ng}\) is the Poynting flux of the
non-guided MHD mode. Thus, the energy density in the coupling region is
continuously increasing as there is no outward transport of energy to
balance the incoming Poynting flux of the fast mode. However,
ionospheric Joule heating provides a significant dissipation mechanism
with H limiting the energy density.

Resonant mode coupling is only a \emph{necessary} condition for field
line resonances to occur. A \emph{sufficient} condition is critical
coupling to a strictly guided mode and absence of dissipation to a
degree that there is enough energy for resonance.

\hypertarget{non-mhd-effects}{%
\section{Non-MHD Effects}\label{non-mhd-effects}}

In higher frequency cases, the Alfvén resonance condition
Equation~\ref{eq:flr_resonance_dispersion} is modified as

\[
\omega^2 = k_\parallel^2 V_A^2(1-\omega^2/\omega_{ci}^2)^2
\]

because of the finite ion Larmor radius effects {[}Stix, 1992{]}.

The Alfvén resonance singularity can be removed by including non‐MHD
effects such as electron inertia or ion Larmor radius corrections. (I
don't quite follow it, but check the papers by Lin, Hasegawa, Chen,
Johnson, and Cheng.) There are very few studies considering the electron
inertia correction, because it is related to \(r_{Ls}/\lambda_e\), where
\(\lambda_e = c/\omega_{pe}\) is the plasma skin depth or electron
inertial length, and \(r_{Ls}=\sqrt{T_e/m_i}/\omega_{ci}\). It is
typically not important except at locations where
\(k_\parallel\rightarrow 0\) such as in a reconnection geometry.

Thus what's usually been considered to remove the singularity is the ion
kinetic effects, where we end up coupling fast waves with kinetic Alfvén
waves of the dispersion relation
Equation~\ref{eq:kaw_dispersion_ion_approxi}.

\hypertarget{sec:nonlinear}{%
\chapter{Nonlinear Effects}\label{sec:nonlinear}}

In many experiments waves are no longer describable by the linear theory
by the time they are observed. Consider, for instance, the case of drift
waves. Because they are unstable, drift waves would, according to linear
theory, increase their amplitude exponentially. This period of growth is
not normally observed --- since one usually does not know when to start
looking --- but instead one observes the waves only after they have
grown to a large, steady amplitude. The fact that the waves are no
longer growing means that the linear thoery is no longer valid, and some
\emph{nonlinear} effect is limiting the amplitude. Theoretical
explanation of this elementary observation has proved to be a
surprisingly difficult problem, since the observed amplitude at
saturation is rather small.

A wave can undergo a number of changes when its amplitude gets large. It
can change its shape --- say, from a sine wave to a lopsided triangular
waveform. This is the same as saying that Fourier components at other
frequencies (or wave numbers) are generated. Ultimately, the wave can
``break'', like ocean waves on a beach, converting the wave energy into
thermal energy of the particles. A large wave can trap particles in its
potential troughs, thus changing the properties of the medium in which
it propagates (e.g.~nonlinear Landau damping). If a plasma is so
strongly excited that a continuous spectrum of frequencies is present,
it is in a state of \emph{turbulence}. This state must be described
statistically, as in the case of hydrodynamics. An important consequence
of plasma turbulence is \emph{anomalous resistivity}, in which electrons
are slowed down by collisions with random electric field fluctuations,
rather than with ions. This effect is used for ohmic heating of a plasma
to temperature so high that ordinary resistivity is insufficient.

Nonlinear phenomena can be grouped into three broad categories:

  with an electron beam (Fig.8-1). Since the distribution function has a
  region where \(df_0/dv\) is positive, the system has inverse Landau
  damping, and plasma oscillations with \(v_\phi\) in the positive-slope
  region are unstable (Equation~\ref{eq:landau}). The resonant electrons
  are the first to be affected by wave-particle interactions, and their
  distribution function will be changed by the wave electric field. The
  waves are stabilized when \(f_e(v)\) is flattened by the waves, as
  shown by the dashed line in Fig.8-1 Figure~\ref{fig:unstable_f}, so

  Waves can interact with each other even in the fluid description, in
  which individual particle effects are neglected. A single wave can
  decay by first generating harmonics of its fundamental frequency.
  These harmonics can then interact with each other and with the primary
  wave to form other waves at the beat frequencies. The beat waves in
  turn can grow so large that they can interact and form many more beat
  frequencies, until the spectrum becomes continuous. It is interesting
  to discuss the direction of energy flow in a turbulent spectrum. In
  fluid dynamics, long-wavelength modes decay into short-wavelength
  modes, because the large eddies contain more energy and can decay only
  by splitting into small eddies, which are each less energetic. The
  smallest eddies then convert their kinetic motion into heat by viscous
  damping. In a plasma, usually the opposite occurs. Short wave-length
  modes tend to coalesce into long-wavelength modes, which are less
  energetic. This is because the electric field energy \(E^2/8\pi\) is
  of order \(k^2\phi^2/8\pi\), so that if \(e\phi\) is fixed (usually by
  \(k_B T_e\)), the small-\(k\), long-\(\lambda\) modes have less
  energy. As a consequence, energy will be transferred to small \(k\) by
  instabilities at large \(k\), and some mechanism must be found to
  dissipate the energy. No such problem exists at large \(k\), where
  Landau damping can occur. For motions along \(\mathbf{B}_0\),
  nonlinear ``modulational'' instabilities could cause the energy at
  small \(k\) to be coupled to ions and to heat them. For motions
  perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}_0\), the largest eddies will have
  wavelengths of the order of the plasma radius and could cause plasma
  loss to the walls by convection.
\end{itemize}

Although problems still remain to be solved in the linear theory of
waves and instabilities, the mainstream of plasma research has turned to
the much less well understood area of nonlinear phenomena. The examples
in the following sections will give an idea of some of the effects that
have been studied in theory and in experiment.

\hypertarget{sec:sheath}{%
\section{The Necessity for Sheaths}\label{sec:sheath}}

In all practical plasma devices, the plasma is contained in a vacuum
chamber of finite size. What happens to the plasma at the wall? For
simplicity, let us confine our attention to a one-dimensional model with
no magnetic field Figure~\ref{fig:sheath}. Suppose there is no
appreciable electric field inside the plasma; we can then let the
potential \(\phi\) be zero there. When ions and electrons hit the wall,
they recombine and are lost. Since electrons have much higher thermal
velocities than ions, they are lost faster and leave the plasma with a
net positive charge. The plasma must then have potential positive with
respect to the wall; i.e., the wall potential \(\phi_w\) is negative.
This potential cannot be distributed over the entire plasma, since Debye
shielding will confine the potential variation to a layer of the order
of several Debye lengths in thickness. This layer, which must exist on
all cold walls with which the plasma is in contact, is called a sheath.
The function of a sheath is to form a potential barrier so that the more
mobile species, usually electrons, is confined. electrostatically. The
height of the barrier adjusts itself so that the flux of electrons that
wave enough energy to go over the barrier to the wall is just equal to
the flux of ions reaching the wall.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:sheath}{%

second.}\label{fig:sheath}

\subsection{The Planar Sheath
Equation}\label{the-planar-sheath-equation}}

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:sheath_potential}{%

\caption{The potential \(\phi\) in a planar sheath. Cold ions are
assumed to enter the sheath with a uniform velocity
\(u_0\).}\label{fig:sheath_potential}
}
\end{figure}

Recall that the Debye length is derived from linearing Poisson's
equation. To examine the exact behavior of \(\phi(x)\) in the sheath, we
must treat the nonlinear problem: we shall find that there is not always
a solution. Figure~\ref{fig:sheath_potential} shows the situation near
one of the walls. At the plane \(x=0\), ions are imagined to enter the
sheath region from the main plasma with a drift velocity \(u_0\). This
drift is needed to accout for the loss of ions to the wall from the
region in which they were created by ionization. For simplicity, we
assume \(T_i=0\), so that all ions have the velocity \(u_0\) at \(x=0\).
We consider the steady state problem in a collisionless sheath region.
The potential \(\phi\) is assumed to decrease monotonically with \(x\).
Actually, \(\phi\) could have spatial oscillations, and then there would
be trapped particles in the steady state. This does not happend in
practice because dissipative processes tend to destroy any such highly
organized state.

If \(u(x)\) is the ion velocity, conservation of energy requires

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath_u}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}mu^2 = \frac{1}{2}mu_0^2 - e\phi(x) \\
u = \Big( u_0^2 - \frac{2e\phi}{m_i} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:sheath_u}\end{equation}

The ion equation of continuity then gives the ion density \(n_i\) in
terms of the density \(n_0\) in the main plasma:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath_n}{}{
\begin{aligned}
n_0 u_0 &= n_i(x) u(x) \\
n_i(x) &= n_0 \Big( 1 - \frac{2e\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:sheath_n}\end{equation}

In steady state, the electrons will follow the Boltzmann relation
closely,

\[
n_e(x) = n_0 \exp(e\phi/k_B T_e)
\]

Poisson's equation is then

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath1}{}{
\epsilon_0\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\phi}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = e(n_e - n_i) = en_0\Big[ \exp\Big( \frac{e\phi}{k_B T_e} \Big) - \Big( 1 - \frac{2e\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \Big)^{1/2} \Big]
}\label{eq:sheath1}\end{equation}

The structure of this equation can be seen more clearly if we simplify
it with the following changes in notation:

\[
\chi\equiv -\frac{e\phi}{k_B T_e}\quad \xi\equiv\frac{x}{\lambda_D} = x\Big( \frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 k_B T_e} \Big)^{1/2}\quad \mu\equiv\frac{u_0}{(k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}}
\]

Then it can be written as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath2}{}{
\chi^{\prime\prime} = \Big( 1+\frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \Big)^{-1/2} - e^{-\chi}
}\label{eq:sheath2}\end{equation}

where the prime denotes \(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}\xi\). This is the
nonlinear equation of a plane sheath, and it has an acceptable solution
only if \(\mu\) is large enough. The reason for the symbol \(\mu\) will
become apparent in the following section on shock waves.

\hypertarget{the-bohm-sheath-criterion}{%
\subsection{The Bohm Sheath Criterion}\label{the-bohm-sheath-criterion}}

Equation~\ref{eq:sheath2} can be integrated once by multiplying both
sides by \(\chi^\prime\):

\[
\int_0^\xi \chi^\prime \chi^{\prime\prime}\mathrm{d}\xi_1 = \int_0^\xi \Big( 1+\frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \Big)^{-1/2} \chi^\prime \mathrm{d}\xi_1 - \int_0^\xi e^{-\chi} \chi^\prime \mathrm{d}\xi_1
\]

where \(\xi_1\) is a dummy variable. Since \(\chi=0\) at \(\xi=0\), the
integration easily yield

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath_int1}{}{
\frac{1}{2}({\chi^\prime}^2 - {\chi_0^\prime}^2) = \mu^2 \Big[ \big(1 + \frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \big)^{1/2} - 1 \Big] + e^{-\chi} -1
}\label{eq:sheath_int1}\end{equation}

If \(\mathbf{E}=0\) in the plasma, we must set \(\chi_0^\prime=0\) at
\(\xi=0\). A second integration to find \(\chi\) would have to be done
numerically; but whatever the answer is, the right-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:sheath_int1} must be positive for all \(\chi\). In
particular, for \(\chi\ll 1\), we can expand the right-hand terms in
Taylor series:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath_bohm}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\mu^2 \Big[ 1+\frac{\chi}{\mu^2}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\chi^2}{\mu^4}+ ... -1 \Big] + 1-\chi+\frac{1}{2}\chi^2+...-1 > 0 \\
\frac{1}{2}\chi^2 \Big( -\frac{1}{\mu^2} + 1\Big) > 0 \\
\mu^2 > 1 \quad\text{or}\quad u_0>(k_BT_e/m_i)^{1/2}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:sheath_bohm}\end{equation}

This inequality is know as the \emph{Bohm sheath criterion}. It says
that ions must enter the sheath with a velocity greater than the
acoustic velocity \(v_s\). To give the ions this directed velocity
\(u_0\), there must be a finite electric field in the plasma. Our
assumption that \(\chi^\prime=0\) at \(\xi=0\) is therefore only an
approximate one, made possible by the fact that the scale of the sheath
region is usually much smaller than the scale of the main plasma region
in which the ions are accelerated. The value of \(u_0\) is somewhat
arbitrary, depending on where we choose to put the boundary \(x=0\)
between the plasma and the sheath. Of course, the ion flux \(n_0u_0\) is
fixed by the ion production rate, so if \(u_0\) is varies, the value of
\(n_0\) at \(x=0\) will vary inversely with \(u_0\). If the ions have
finite temperature, the critical drift velocity \(u_0\) will be somewhat
lower.

The physical reason for the Bohm criterion is easily seen from a plot of
the ion and electron densities vs.~\(\chi\)
Figure~\ref{fig:sheath_n_variation}. The electron density \(n_e\) falls
exponentially with \(\chi\), according to the Boltzmann relation. The
ion density also falls, since the ions are accelerated by the sheath
potential. If the ions start with a large energy, \(n_i(\chi)\) falls
slowly, since the sheath field causes a relatively minor change in the
ions' velocity. If the ions start with a small energy, \(n_i(\chi)\)
falls fast, and can go belwo the \(n_e\) curve. In that case,
\(n_e-n_i\) is positive near \(\chi=0\); and Equation~\ref{eq:sheath2}
tells us that \(\phi(x)\) must curve upward, in contradiction to the
requirement that the sheath must repel electrons. In order for this not
to happen, the slope of \(n_i(\chi)\) at \(\chi=0\) must be smaller (in
absolute value) than that of \(n_e(\chi)\); this condition is identical
with the condition \(\mu^2>1\).

\hypertarget{the-child-langmuir-law}{%
\subsection{The Child-Langmuir Law}\label{the-child-langmuir-law}}

Since \(n_e(\chi)\) falls exponentially with \(\chi\), the electron
density can be neglected in the region of large \(\chi\) next to the
wall (or any negative electrode). Poisson's equation is then
approximately

\[
\chi^{\prime\prime} \approx \Big( 1+\frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \Big)^{-1/2} \approx \frac{\mu}{(2\chi)^{1/2}}
\]

Multiplying by \(\chi^\prime\) and integrating from \(\xi_1=\xi_s\) to
\(\xi_1=\xi\), we have

\[
\frac{1}{2}({\chi^\prime}^2 - {\chi_s^\prime}^2) = \sqrt{2}\mu(\chi^{1/2} - \chi_s^{1/2})
\]

where \(\xi_s\) is the place where we started neglecting \(n_e\). We can
redefine the zero of \(\chi\) so that \(\chi_s=1\) at \(\xi=\xi_s\). We
shall also neglect \(\chi_s^\prime\), since the slope of the potential
curve can be expected to be much steeper in the \(n_e=0\) region than in
the finite-\(n_e\) region. Then the above equation becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
{\chi^\prime}^2 &= 2^{3/2}\mu\chi^{1/2} \\
\chi^\prime &= 2^{3/4}\mu^{1/2}\chi^{1/4} \\
\mathrm{d}\chi/\chi^{1/4} &= 2^{3/4}\mu^{1/2} \mathrm{d}\xi
\end{aligned}
\]

Integrating from \(\xi=\xi_s\) to
\(\xi=\xi_s+\mathrm{d}/\lambda_D = \xi_{\text{wall}}\), we have

\[
\frac{4}{3}\chi_w^{3/4} = 2^{3/4}\mu^{1/2}\mathrm{d}/\lambda_D
\]

or

\[
\mu = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{9}\frac{\chi_w^{3/2}}{\mathrm{d}^2}\lambda_D^2
\]

Changing back to the variables \(u_0\) and \(\phi\), and noting that the
ion current into the wall is \(J=en_0u_0\), we then find

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:child_langmuir}{}{
J = \frac{4}{9}\Big( \frac{2e}{m_i} \Big)^{1/2} \frac{\epsilon_0|\phi_w|^{3/2}}{\mathrm{d}^2}
}\label{eq:child_langmuir}\end{equation}

This is just the well-known Child-Langmuir law of space-charge-limited
current in a plane diode.

The potential variation in a plasma-wall system can be divided into
three parts. Nearest the wall is an electron-free region whose thickness
\(\mathrm{d}\) given by Equation~\ref{eq:child_langmuir}. Here \(J\) is
determined by the ion production rate, and \(\phi_w\) is determined by
the equility of electron and ion fluxes. Next comes a region in which
\(n_e\) is appreciable; as shown in the linear theory from which the
scale of Debye length is derived. Finally, there is a region with much
larger scale length, the ``presheath'', in which the ions are
accelerated to the required velocity \(u_0\) by a potential drop
\(|\phi|\ge \frac{1}{2}k_B T_E/e\). Depending on the experiment, the
scale of the presheath may be set by the plasma radius, the collisional
mean free path, or the ionization mechanism. The potential distribution,
of course, varies smoothly; the division into three regions is made only
for convenience and is made possible by the disparity in scale lengths.
In the early days of gas discharges, sheaths could be observed as dark
layers where no electrons were present to excite atoms to emission.
Subsequently, the potential variation has been measured by the
electrostatic deflection of a thin electron beam shot parallel to a
wall.

\hypertarget{electrostatic-probes}{%
\subsection{Electrostatic Probes}\label{electrostatic-probes}}

The sheath criterion Equation~\ref{eq:sheath_bohm} can be used to
estimate the flux of ions to a negatively biased probe in a plasma. If
the probe has a surface area \(A\), and if the ions entering the sheath
have a drift velocity \(u_0\ge (k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}\), then the ion
current collected is

\[
I = n_s e A(k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}
\]

The electron current can be neglected if the probe is sufficiently
negative (several times \(k_B T_e\)) relative to the plasma to repel all
but the tail of the Maxwellian electron distribution. The density
\(n_s\) is the plasma density at the edge of the sheath. Let us define
the sheath edge to be the place where \(u_0\) is exactly
\((k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}\). To accelerate ions to this velocity requires a
presheath potential \(|\phi|\ge\frac{1}{2}k_B T_e/e\), so that the
sheath edge has a potential

\[
\phi_s \simeq -\frac{1}{2}k_B T_e/e
\]

relative to the body of the plasma. If the electrons are Maxwellian,
this determines \(n_s\):

\[
n_s = n_0 e^{e\phi_s/k_BT_e} = n_0 e^{-1/2} \approx 0.61 n_0
\]

For our purposes it is accurate enough to replace 0.61 with a round
number like 1/2; thus, the ``saturation ion current'' to a negative
probe is approximately

\[
I_B \simeq \frac{1}{2}n_0 e A (k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}
\]

\(I_B\), sometimes called the ``Bohm current'', give the plasma density
easily, once the temperature is known.

If the Debye length \(\lambda_D\), and hence the sheath thickness, is
very small compared to the probe dimensions, the area of the sheath edge
is effectively the same as the area \(A\) of the probe surface,
regardless of its shape. At low densities, however, \(\lambda_D\) can
become large, so that some ions entering the sheath can orbit the probe
and miss it. Calculations of orbits for various probe shapes were first
made by I. Langmuir and L. Tonks --- hence the name ``\textbf{Langmuir
probe}'' ascribed to this method of measurement. Though tedious, these
calculations can give accurate determinations of plasma density because
an arbitrary definition of sheath edge does not have to be made. By
varying the probe voltage, the Maxwellian electron distribution is
sampled, and the current-voltage curve of a Langmuir probe can also
yield the electron temperature. The electrostatic probe was the first
plasma diagnostic and is still the simplest and the most localized
measurement device. Unfortunately, material electrodes can be inserted
only in low-density, cool plasma.

More detailed explanation of how to measure the plasma density using a
Langmuir probe is given \href{https://youtu.be/u44NH1o6Tp8}{here}.

\hypertarget{ion-acoustic-shock-waves}{%
\section{Ion Acoustic Shock Waves}\label{ion-acoustic-shock-waves}}

When a jet travels faster than sound, it creates a shock wave. This is a
basically nonlinear phenomenon, since there is no period when the wave
is small and growing. The jet is faster than the speed of waves in air,
so the undisturbed medium cannot be ``warned'' by precursor signals
before the large shock wave hits it. In hydrodynamic shock waves,
collisions are dominant. Shock waves also exist in plasmas, even when
there are no collisions. A magnetic shock, the ``bow shock'', is
generated by the earth as it plows through the interplanetary plasma
while dragging along a dipole magnetic field. We shall discuss a simpler
example: a collisionless, one-dimensional shock wave which develops from
a large-amplitude ion wave.

(Normal space plasma textbooks discuss this part starting from R-H
relations. I don't like that.)

\hypertarget{the-sagdeev-potential}{%
\subsection{The Sagdeev Potential}\label{the-sagdeev-potential}}

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:shock_potential}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/shock_potential.png}
\caption{Typical potential distribution in an ion acoustic shock wave.
The wave moves to the left, so that in the wave frame ions stream into
the wave from the left with velocity
\(u_0\).}\label{fig:shock_potential}
}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:shock_potential} shows the idealized potential profile
of an ion acoustic shock wave. The reason for this shape will be given
presently. The wave is traveling to the left with a velocity \(u_0\). If
we go to the frame moving with the wave, the function \(\phi(x)\) will
be constant in time, and we will see a stream of plasma impinging on the
wave from the left with a velocity \(u_0\). For simplicity, let \(T_i\)
be zero, so that all the ions are incident with the same velocity
\(u_0\), and let hte electrons be Maxwellian. Since the shock moves much
more slowly than the electron thermal speed, the shift in the center
velocity of the Maxwellian can be neglected. The velocity of the ions in
the shock wave is, from energy conservation,

\[
u = \Big( u_0^2 - \frac{2e\phi}{m_i} \Big)^{1/2}
\]

If \(n_0\) is the density of the undisturbed plasma, the ion density in
the shock is

\[
n_i = \frac{n_0 u_0}{u} = n_0 \Big( 1 - \frac{2e\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \Big)^{-1/2}
\]

The electron density is given by the Boltzmann relation. Poisson's
equation then gives

\[
\epsilon_0\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\phi}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = e(n_e - n_i) = en_0\Big[ \exp\Big( \frac{e\phi}{k_B T_e} \Big) - \Big( 1 - \frac{2e\phi}{m_i u_0^2} \Big)^{1/2} \Big]
\]

This is, of course, the same Equation~\ref{eq:sheath1} as we had for a
sheath. A shock wave is no more than a sheath moving through a plasma.
We now introduce the dimensionless variables

\[
\chi\equiv \frac{e\phi}{k_B T_e}\quad \xi\equiv\frac{x}{\lambda_D} = x\Big( \frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 k_B T_e} \Big)^{1/2}\quad \mu\equiv\frac{u_0}{(k_B T_e/m_i)^{1/2}}
\]

Note that we have changed the sign in the definition of \(\chi\) so as
to keep \(\chi\) positive in this problem. The quantity \(\mu\) is
called the \emph{Mach number} of the shock. Poisson's equation can now
be written

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sheath3}{}{
\chi^{\prime\prime} = e^{\chi} - \Big( 1 - \frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \Big)^{-1/2} = -\frac{dV(\chi)}{\mathrm{d}\chi}
}\label{eq:sheath3}\end{equation}

which differs from the sheath Equation~\ref{eq:sheath2} only because of
the change in sign of \(\chi\).

The behavior of the solution of Equation~\ref{eq:sheath3} was made clear
by R. Z. Sagdeev, who used an analogy to an oscillator in a potential
well. The displacement \(x\) of an oscillator subjected to a force
\(-mdV(x)/\mathrm{d}x\) is given by

\[
\ddot{x} = -dV/\mathrm{d}x
\]

If the right-hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:sheath3} is defined as
\(-dV/\mathrm{d}x\), the equation is the same as that of an oscillator,
with the potential \(\chi\) playing the role of \(\chi\), and
\(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}\xi\) replacing \(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}t\). The
quasipotential \(V(\chi)\) is sometimes called the Sagdeev potential.
The function \(V(x)\) can be found from Equation~\ref{eq:sheath3} by
integration with the boundary condition \(V(\chi)=0\) at \(\chi=0\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:sagdeev_potential}{}{
V(\chi) = 1-e^\chi + \mu^2 \Big[ 1 - \Big( 1-\frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \Big)^{1/2} \Big]
}\label{eq:sagdeev_potential}\end{equation}

For \(\mu\) lying in a certain range, this function has the shape shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:shock_quasipotential}. If this were a real well, a
particle entering from the left will go to the right-hand side of the
well (\(x>0\)), reflect, and return to \(x=0\), making a single transit.
Similarly, a quasiparticle in our analogy will make a single excursion
to positive \(\chi\) and return to \(\chi =0\), as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:shock_soliton}. Such a pulse is called a \emph{soliton}:
it is a potential and density disturbance propagating to the left in
Figure~\ref{fig:shock_soliton} with velocity \(u_0\). (I DON'T FULLY
UNDERSTAND!!!)

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:shock_quasipotential}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/shock_quasipotential.png}
\caption{The Sagdeev potential \(V(\chi)\). The upper arrow is the
trajectory of a quasiparticle describing a soliton: it is reflected at
the right and returns. The lower arrows show the motion of a
quasiparticle that has lost energy and is trapped in the potential well.

front.}\label{fig:shock_quasipotential}
}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:shock_soliton}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/shock_soliton.png}
\caption{The potential in a soliton moving to the
left.}\label{fig:shock_soliton}
}
\end{figure}

Now, if a particle suffers a loss of energy while in the well, it will
never return to \(x=0\) but will oscillate (in time) about some positive
value of \(x\). Similarly, a little dissipation will make the potential
of a shock wave oscillate (in space) about some positive value of
\(\phi\). This is exactly the behavoir depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:shock_potential}. Actually, dissipation is not needed
for this: reflection of ions from the shock front has the same effect.
To understand this, imagine that the ions have a small thermal spread in
energy and that the height \(e\phi\) of the wave front is just large
enough to reflect some of the ions back to the left, while the rest go
over the potential hill to the right. The reflected ions cause an
increase in ion density in the upstream region to the left of the shock
front (Figure~\ref{fig:shock_potential}). This means that the quantity

\[
\chi^\prime = \frac{1}{n_0}\int_0^\xi (n_e - n_i)\mathrm{d}\xi_1
\]

is decreased. Since \(\chi^\prime\) is the analog of
\(\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}t\) in the oscillator problem, our virtual
oscillator has lost velocity and is trapped in the potential well of
Figure~\ref{fig:shock_quasipotential}.

\hypertarget{the-critical-mach-numbers}{%
\subsection{The Critical Mach Numbers}\label{the-critical-mach-numbers}}

Solutions of either the soliton type or the wave-train type exist only
for a range of \(\mu\). A lower limit for \(\mu\) is given by the
condition that \(V(\chi)\) be a potential well, rather than a hill.
Expanding Equation~\ref{eq:sagdeev_potential} for \(\chi\ll 1\) yields

\[
\mu^2 > 1 \quad u_0>(k_BT_e/m_i)^{1/2}
\]

This is exactly the same, both physically and mathematically, as the
Bohm criterion for the existence of a sheath
(Equation~\ref{eq:sheath_bohm}).

An upper limit to \(\mu\) is imposed by the condition that the function
\(V(\chi)\) of Figure~\ref{fig:shock_quasipotential} must cross the
\(\chi\) axis for \(\chi>0\); otherwise, the virtual particle will not
be reflected, and the potential will rise indefinitely. From
Equation~\ref{eq:sagdeev_potential}, we require

\[
e^\chi - 1 < \mu^2 \Big[ 1- \big( 1-\frac{2\chi}{\mu^2} \Big)^{1/2} \Big]
\]

for some \(\chi>0\). If the lower critical Mach number is surpassed
(\(\mu>1\)), the left-and side, representing the integral of the
electron density from zero to \(\chi\), is initially larger than the
right-hand side, representing the integral of the ion density. As
\(\chi\) increases, the right-hand side can catch up with the left-hand
side if \(\mu^2\) is not too large. However, because of the square root,
the largest value \(\chi\) can have is \(\mu^2/2\). This is because
\(e\phi\) cannot exceed \(\frac{1}{2}m_iu_0^2\); otherwise, ions would
be excluded from the plasma in the downstream region. Inserting the
largest value of \(\chi\) into the above equation, we have

\[
\exp(\mu^2/2) - 1 < \mu \quad\text{or}\quad \mu < 1.6
\]

This is the upper critical Mach number. Shock waves in a cold-ion plasma
therefore exist only for \(1<\mu<1.6\).

As in the case of sheaths, the physical situation is best explained by a
diagram of \(n_i\) and \(n_e\) vs.~\(\chi\) (Figure~\ref{fig:shock_n}).
This diagram differs from Figure~\ref{fig:sheath_n_variation} because of
the change of sign of \(\phi\). Since the ions are now decelerated
rather than accelerated, \(n_i\) will appraoch infinity at
\(\chi=\mu^2/2\). The lowe critical Mach number ensures that the \(n_i\)
curve lies below the \(n_e\) curve at small \(\chi\), so that the
potential \(\phi(x)\) starts off with the right sign for its curvature.
When the curve \(n_{i1}\) crosses the \(n_e\) curve, the soliton
(Figure~\ref{fig:shock_soliton}) has an inflection point. Finally, when
\(\chi\) is large enough that the areas under the \(n_i\) and \(n_e\)
curves are equal, the soliton reaches a peak, and the \(n_{i1}\) and
\(n_e\) curves are retraced as \(\chi\) goes back to zero. The equality
of the areas ensures that the net charge in the soliton is zero;
therefore, there is no electric field outside. If \(\mu\) is larger than
1.6, we have the curve \(n_{i2}\), in which the area under the curve is
too small even when \(\chi\) has reached its maximum value of
\(\mu^2/2\).

\hypertarget{wave-steepening}{%
\subsection{Wave Steepening}\label{wave-steepening}}

If one propagates an ion wave in a cold-ion plasma, it will have the
phase velocity given by

\[
v_p = \Big( \frac{k_B T_e + \gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i} \Big)^{1/2} = \Big( \frac{k_B T_e}{m_i} \Big)^{1/2}
\]

corresponding to \(\mu=1\). How, then, can one create shocks with
\(\mu>1\)? One must remember that the above phase velocity was a linear
result valid only at small amplitudes. As the amplitude is increased, an
ion wave speeds up and also changes from a sine wave to a sawtooth shape
with a steep leading edge (Figure~\ref{fig:wave_steepening}). The reason
is that the wave electric field has accelerated the ions. In
Figure~\ref{fig:wave_steepening}, ions at the peak of the potential
distribution have a large velocity in the direction of \(v_\phi\) than
those at the trough, since they have just experienced a period of
acceleration as the wave passed by. In linear theory, this difference in
velocity is taken into account, but not the displacement resulting from
it. In nonlinear theory, it is easy to see that the ions at the peak are
shifted to the right, while those at the trough are shifted to the left,
thus steepening the wave shape. Since the density perturbation is in
pahse with the potential, more ions are accelerated to the right than to
the left, and the wave causes a net mass flow in the direction of
propagation. This causes the wave velocity to exceed the acoustic speed
in the undisturbed plasma, so that \(\mu\) is larger than unity.

\hypertarget{double-layers}{%
\subsection{Double Layers}\label{double-layers}}

A phenomenon related to sheaths and ion acoustic shocks is that of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_(plasma_physics)}{double
layer}. This is a localized potential jump, believed to occur naturally
in the ionosphere, which neither propagates nor is attached to a
boundary. The name comes from the successive layers of net positive and
net negative charge that are necessary to create a step in \(\phi(x)\).
Such a step can remain stationary in space only if there is a plasma
flow that Doppler shifts a shock front down to zero velocity in the lab
frame, or if the distribution functions of the transmitted and reflected
electrons and ions on each side of the discontinuity are specially
tailored so as to make this possible. In natural situations double
layers are likely to arise where there are gradients in the magnetic
field \(\mathbf{B}\), not where \(\mathbf{B}\) is zero or uniform, as in
laboratory simulations. In that case, the \(\mu\nabla B\) force can play
a large role in localizing a double layer away from all boundaries.
Indeed, the thermal barrier in tandem mirror reactors is an example of a
double layer with strong magnetic trapping.

\hypertarget{sec:ponderomotive}{%
\section{The Ponderomotive Force}\label{sec:ponderomotive}}

Light waves exert a radiation pressure which is usually very weak and
hard to detect. Even the esoteric example of comet tails, formed by the
pressure of sunlight, is tainted by the added effect of particles
streaming from the sun. When high-powered microwaves or laser beams are
used to heat or confine plasmas, however, the radiation pressure can
reach several hundred thousand atmospheres! When applied to a plasma,
this force is coupled to the particles in a somewhat subtle way and is
called the \emph{ponderomotive force}. Many nonlinear phenomena have a
simple explanation in terms of the ponderomotive force.

The easiest way to derive this nonlinear force is to consider the motion
of an electron in the oscillating \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\)
fields of a wave. We neglect dc \(\mathbf{E}_0\) and \(\mathbf{B}_0\)
fields. The electron equation of motion is

\[
m\dot{\mathbf{v}} = -e[\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})]
\]

This equation is exact if \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are
evaluated at the instantaneous position of the electron. The
nonlinearity comes partly from the \(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\), which
is second order because both \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) vanish in
the equilibrium, so that the term is no larger than
\(\mathbf{v}_1\times\mathbf{B}_1\), where \(\mathbf{v}_1\) and
\(\mathbf{B}_1\) are the linear-theory values. The other part of the
nonlinearity, as we shall see, comes from evaluating \(\mathbf{E}\) at
the actual position of the particle rather than its initial position.
Assume a wave electric field of the form

\[
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_s(\mathbf{r})\cos\omega t
\]

where \(\mathbf{E}_s(\mathbf{r})\) contains the spatial dependence. In
first order, we may neglect the \(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\) term in
the equation of motion and evaluate \(\mathbf{E}\) at the initial
position \(\mathbf{r}_0\). We have

\[
\begin{aligned}
m\dot{\mathbf{v}}_1 &=  -e\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}_0)\\
\mathbf{v}_1 &= -(e/m\omega)\mathbf{E}_s\sin\omega t = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1 \\
\delta \mathbf{r}_1 &= (e/m\omega^2)\mathbf{E}_s\cos\omega t
\end{aligned}
\]

It is important to note that \emph{in a nonlinear calculation, we cannot
write \(e^{i\omega t}\) and takes its real part later.} Instead, we
write its real part explicitly as \(\cos\omega t\). This is because
products of oscillating factors appera in nonlinear theory, and the
operations of multiplying and taking the real part do not commute.

Going to second order, we expand \(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})\) about
\(\mathbf{r}_0\):

\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}_0) + (\delta\mathbf{r}_0\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{E}|_{r=r_0} + ...
\]

We must now add the term \(\mathbf{v}_1\times\mathbf{B}_1\), where
\(\mathbf{B}_1\) is given by Maxwell's equation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} &= -\dot{\mathbf{B}} \\
\mathbf{B}_1 &= -(1/\omega)\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_s|_{r=r_0}\sin\omega t
\end{aligned}
\]

The second-order part of the equation of motion is then

\[
m\dot{\mathbf{v}}_2 = -e[(\delta\mathbf{r}_1\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}_1\times\mathbf{B}_1]
\]

Inserting the expressions of \(\mathbf{v}_1,\delta\mathbf{r}_1\) and
\(\mathbf{B}_1\) into the above and averaging over time, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:motion_e_2nd}{}{
m\left< \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_2}{\mathrm{d}t}\right> = -\frac{e^2}{m\omega^2}\frac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{E}_s\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{E}_s + \mathbf{E}_s\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_s)] = \mathbf{f}_{NL}
}\label{eq:motion_e_2nd}\end{equation}

Here we have used
\(\left<\sin^2\omega t\right> = \left<\cos^2\omega t\right>=\frac{1}{2}\).
The double cross product can be written as the sum of two terms, one of
which cancels the \((\mathbf{E}_s\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{E}_s\) term.

What remains is

\[
\mathbf{f}_{NL} = -\frac{1}{4}\frac{e^2}{m\omega^2}\nabla E_s^2
\]

This is the effective nonlinear force on a single electron. The force
per \(m^3\) is \(\mathbf{f}_{NL}\) times the electron density \(n_0\),
which can be written in terms of \(\omega_p^2\). Since
\(E_s^2 = 2\left<E^2\right>\), we finally have for the ponderomotive
force the formula

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ponderomotive}{}{
\mathbf{F}_{NL} = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\nabla\frac{\left<\epsilon_0 E^2\right>}{2}
}\label{eq:ponderomotive}\end{equation}

If the wave is electromagnetic, the second term in
Equation~\ref{eq:motion_e_2nd} is dominant, and the physical mechanism
for \(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\) is as follows. Electrons oscillate in the
direction of \(\mathbf{E}\), but the wave magnetic field distorts their
orbits. That is, the Lorentz force \(-e\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\)
pushes the electrons in the direction of \(\mathbf{k}\) (since
\(\mathbf{v}\) is in the direction of \(\mathbf{E}\), and
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) is in the direction of \(\mathbf{k}\)).
The phases of \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are such that the motion
does not average to zero over an oscillation, but there is a secular
drift along \(\mathbf{k}\). If the wave has uniform amplitude, no force
is needed to maintain this drift; but if the wave amplitude varies, the
electrons will pile up in regions of small amplitude, and a force is
needed to overcome the space charge. This is why the effective force
\(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\) is proportional to the \emph{gradient} of
\(\left<E^2 \right>\). Since the drift for each electron is the same,
\(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\) is proportional to the density --- hence the factor
\(\omega_p^2/\omega^2\).

If the wave is electrostatic, the first term in
Equation~\ref{eq:motion_e_2nd} is dominant. Then the physical mechanism
is simply that an electron oscillating along
\(\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{E}\) moves farther in the half-cycle when
it is moving from a strong-field region to a weak-field region than vice
versa, so there is a net drift.

Although \(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\) acts mainly on the electrons, the force is
ultimately transmitted to the ions, since it is a low-frequency or dc
effect. When electrons are bunched by \(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\), a
charge-separation field \(\mathbf{E}_{cs}\) is created. The total force
felt by the electrons is

\[
\mathbf{F}_e = -e\mathbf{E}_{cs} + \mathbf{F}_{NL}
\]

Since the ponderomotive force on the ions is smaller by
\(\Omega_p^2/\omega_p^2 = m_e/m_i\), the force on the ion fluid is
approximately

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = e\mathbf{E}_{cs}
\]

Summing the last two equations, we find that the force on the plasma is
\(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\).

A direct effect of \(\mathbf{F}_{NL}\) is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-focusing\#Plasma_self-focusing}{self-focusing
of laser light in a plasma}. In Figure~\ref{fig:laser_self-focusing} we
see that a laser beam of finite diameter causes a radially directed
ponderomotive force in a plasma. This force moves plasma out of the
beam, so that \(\omega_p\) is lower and hte dielectric constant
\(\epsilon\) is higher inside the beam than outside. The plasma then
acts as a convex lens, focusing the beam to a smaller diameter.

\hypertarget{parametric-instabilities}{%
\section{Parametric Instabilities}\label{parametric-instabilities}}

The most thoroughly investigated nonlinear wave-wave interactions are
the ``parametric instabilities'', so called because of an analogy with
parametric amplifiers, well-known devices in electrical engineering. A
reason for the relatively advanced state of understanding of this
subject is that the theory is basically a linear one, but linear about
anoscillating equilibirum.

\hypertarget{coupled-oscillators}{%
\subsection{Coupled Oscillators}\label{coupled-oscillators}}

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:parametric_amplifier}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/parametric_amplifier.png}
\caption{A mechanical analog of a parametric
instability.}\label{fig:parametric_amplifier}
}
\end{figure}

Consider the mechanical model of Figure~\ref{fig:parametric_amplifier},
in which two oscillators M1 and M2 are coupled to a bar resting on a
pivot. The pivot P is made to slide back and forth at a frequency
\(\omega_0\), while the natural frequencies of the oscillators are
\(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\). It is clear that, in the absence of
friction, the pivot encounters no resistance as long as M1 and M2 are
not moving. Furthermore, if P is not moving and M2 is put into motion,
M1 will move; but as long as ω2 is not the natural frequency of M1, the
amplitude will be small. Suppose now that both P and M2 are set into
motion. The displacement of M1 is proportional to the product of the
displacement of M2 and the length of the lever arm and, hence, will vary
in time as

\[
\cos\omega_2 t \cos\omega_0 t = \frac{1}{2}\cos[(\omega_2 + \omega_0)t] + \frac{1}{2}\cos[(\omega_2 - \omega_0)t]
\]

If \(\omega_1\) is equal to either \(\omega_2+\omega_0\) or
\(\omega_2-\omega_0\), M1 will be resonantly excited and will grow to
large amplitude. Once M1 starts oscillating, M2 will also gain energy,
because one of the beat frequencies of \(\omega_1\) with \(\omega_0\) is
just \(\omega_2\). Thus, once either oscillator is started, each will be
excited by the other, and the system is unstable. The energy, of course,
comes from the ``pump'' P, which encounters resistance once the rod is
slanted. If the pump is strong enough, its oscillation amplitude is
unaffected by M1 and M2; the instability can then be treated by a linear
theory. In a plasma, the oscillators P, M1, and M2 may be different
types of waves.

\hypertarget{frequency-matching}{%
\subsection{Frequency Matching}\label{frequency-matching}}

The equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator \(x_1\) is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator}{}{
\ddot{x}_1 + \omega_1^2 x_1 = 0
}\label{eq:oscillator}\end{equation}

where \(\omega_1\) is its resonant frequency. If it is driven by a
time-dependent force which is proportional to the product of the
amplitude \(E_0\) of the driver, or pump, and the amplitude \(x_2\) of a
second oscillator, the equation of motion becomes

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_x1}{}{
\ddot{x}_1 + \omega_1^2 x_1 = c_1x_2E_0
}\label{eq:oscillator_x1}\end{equation}

where \(c_1\) is a constant indicating the strength of the coupling. A
similar equation holds for \(x_2\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_x2}{}{
\ddot{x}_2 + \omega_1^2 x_2 = c_2x_1E_0
}\label{eq:oscillator_x2}\end{equation}

Let \(x_1=\bar{x}_1 \cos\omega t\),
\(x_2=\bar{x}_2 \cos\omega^\prime t\), and
\(E_0=\bar{E}_0 \cos\omega_0 t\). Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x2}
becomes

\[
\begin{aligned}
(\omega_2^2 - {\omega^\prime}^2)\bar{x}_2\cos\omega^\prime t &= c_2\bar{E}_0\bar{x}_1\cos\omega_0 t\cos\omega t \\
&= c_2\bar{E}_0\bar{x}_1 \frac{1}{2}\{ \cos[(\omega_0 + \omega)t] + \cos[(\omega_0 - \omega)t]  \}
\end{aligned}
\]

The driving terms on the right can excite oscillators \(x_2\) with
frequencies

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching}{}{
\omega^\prime = \omega_0\pm\omega
}\label{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching}\end{equation}

In the absence of nonlinear interactions, \(x_2\) can only have the
frequency \(\omega_2\), so we must have \(ω^\prime = \omega_2\).
However, the driving terms can cause a frequency shift so that
\(ω^\prime\) is only approximately equal to \(\omega_2\). Furthermore,
\(\omega^\prime\) can be complex, since there is damping (which has been
neglected so far for simplicity), or there can be growth (if there is an
instability). In either case, \(x_2\) is an oscillator with finite Q and
can respond to a range of frequencies about \(\omega_2\). If \(\omega\)
is small, one can see from that both choices for \(\omega^\prime\) may
lie within the bandwidth of \(x_2\), and one must allow for the
existence of two oscillators, \(x_2(\omega_0+\omega)\) and
\(x_2(\omega_0 - \omega)\).

Now let \(x_1 = \bar{x}_1\cos\omega^{\prime\prime}t\) and
\(x_2 = \bar{x}_2\cos[(\omega_0\pm \omega)t]\) and insert into
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x1}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_momentum}{}{
\begin{aligned}
&(\omega_1^2 - {\omega^{\prime\prime}}^2)\bar{x}_1\cos\omega^{\prime\prime} t \\
&= c_1\bar{E}_0\bar{x}_2\frac{1}{2}\big(\cos\{[\omega_0 + (\omega_0\pm\omega)]t\} + \cos\{ [\omega_0 - (\omega_0\pm\omega)]t \}  \big)\\
&= c_1\bar{E}_0\bar{x}_2\frac{1}{2}\big(\cos[(2\omega_0 \pm\omega) t] + \cos\omega t  \big)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:oscillator_momentum}\end{equation}

The driving terms can excite not only the original oscillation
\(x_1(\omega)\), but also new frequencies
\(\omega^{\prime\prime} = 2\omega_0\pm\omega\). We shall consider the
case \(|\omega_0| \gg |\omega_1|\), so that \(2\omega_0\pm\omega\) lies
outside the range of frequencies to which \(x_1\) can respond, and
\(x_1(2\omega_0\pm\omega)\) can be neglected. We therefore have three
oscillators, \(x_1(\omega)\), \(x_2(\omega_0-\omega)\), and
\(x_2(\omega_0+\omega)\), which are coupled by
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x1} and Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x2}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_energy}{}{
\begin{aligned}
(\omega_1^2 - \omega^2)x_1(\omega) - c_1E_0(\omega_0)[ x_2(\omega_0-\omega) + x_2(\omega_0 + \omega) ] &= 0 \\
[\omega_2^2 - (\omega_0-\omega)^2]x_2(\omega_0-\omega) - c_2E_0(\omega_0)x_1(\omega) &= 0 \\
[\omega_2^2 - (\omega_0+\omega)^2]x_2(\omega_0+\omega) - c_2E_0(\omega_0)x_1(\omega) &= 0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:oscillator_energy}\end{equation}

The dispersion relation is given by setting the determinant of the
coefficients equal to zero:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_dispersion}{}{
\begin{vmatrix}
\omega^2 - \omega_1^2 & c_1E_0 & c_1 E_0 \\
c_2E_0 & (\omega_0-\omega)^2 - \omega_2^2 & 0 \\
c_2E_0 & 0 & (\omega_0+\omega)^2 - \omega_2^2
\end{vmatrix} = 0
}\label{eq:oscillator_dispersion}\end{equation}

A solution with \(\Im(\omega)>0\) would indicate an instability.

For small frequency shifts and small damping or growth rates, we can set
\(\omega\) and \(\omega^\prime\) approximately equal to the undisturbed
frequencies \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\).
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching} then gives a frequency
matching condition:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching2}{}{
\omega_0 \approx \omega_2 \pm \omega_1
}\label{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching2}\end{equation}

When the oscillators are waves in a plasma, \(\omega t\) must be
replaced by \(\omega t - \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}\). There is then also
a wavelength matching condition

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching3}{}{
\mathbf{k}_0 \approx \mathbf{k}_2 \pm \mathbf{k}_1
}\label{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching3}\end{equation}

describing spatial beats; that is, the periodicity of points of
constructive and destructive interference in space. The two conditions
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching2} and
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching3} are easily understood
by analogy with quantum mechanics. Multiplying the former by Planck's
constant \(\hbar\), we have

\[
\hbar\omega_0 = \hbar\omega_2 \pm \hbar\omega_1
\]

\(E_0\) and \(x_2\) may, for instance, be electromagnetic waves, so that
\(\hbar\omega_0\) and \(\hbar\omega_2\) are the photon energies. The
oscillator \(x_1\) may be a Langmuir wave, or plasmon, with energy
\(\hbar\omega_1\). Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_energy} simply states the
conservation of energy. Similarly, Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_momentum}
states the conservation of momentum \(\hbar\mathbf{k}\).

For plasma waves, the simultaneous satisfaction of
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_frequency_matching} and
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_momentum} in one-dimensional problems is
possible only for certain combinations of waves. The required
relationships are best seen on an \(\omega-k\) diagram
Figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram_construction}. (A) shows the dispersion
curves of an electron plasma wave \(\omega_2\) (Bohm-Gross wave) and an
ion acoustic wave \(\omega_1\). A large-amplitude electron wave
\((\omega_0, \mathbf{k}_0)\) can decay into a backward moving electron
wave \((\omega_2, \mathbf{k}_2)\) and an ion wave
\((\omega_1, \mathbf{k}_1)\). The parallelogram construction ensures
that \(\omega_0 = \omega_1 + \omega_2\) and
\(\mathbf{k}_0 = \mathbf{k}_1 + \mathbf{k}_2\). The positions of
\((\omega_0, \mathbf{k}_0)\) and \((\omega_2, \mathbf{k}_2)\) on the
electron curve must be adjusted so that the difference vector lies on
the ion curve. Note that an electron wave cannot decay into two other
electron waves, because there is no way to make the difference vector
lie on the electron curve.

B shows the parallelogram construction for the ``parametric decay''
instability. Here, \((\omega_0, \mathbf{k}_0)\) is an incident
electromagnetic wave of large phase velocity
\((\omega_0/k_0\approx c)\). It excites an electron wave and an ion wave
moving in opposite directions. Since \(|\mathbf{k}_0|\) is small, we
have \(|\mathbf{k}_1|\approx -|\mathbf{k}_2|\) and
\(\omega_0=\omega_1+\omega_2\) for this instability.

C shows the \(\omega-k\) diagram for the ``parametric backscattering''
instability, in which a light wave excites an ion wave and another light
wave moving in the opposite direction. This can also happen when the ion
wave is replaced by a plasma wave. By analogy with similar phenomena in
solid state physics, these processes are called, respectively,
``stimulated Brillouin scattering'' and ``stimulated Raman scattering.''

D represents the two-plasmon decay instability of an electromagnetic
wave. Note that the two decay waves are both electron plasma waves, so
that frequency matching can occur only if \(\omega_0\simeq 2\omega_p\).
Expressed in terms of density, this condition is equivalent to
\(n\simeq n_c/4\), when \(n_c\) is the critical density associated with
\(\omega_0\) (\(n_C = m\epsilon_0 \omega_0^2/e^2\)). This instability
can therefore be expected to occur only near the ``quarter-critical''
layer of an inhomogeneous plasma.

instability.}\label{fig:parallelogram_construction}
}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{instability-threshold}{%
\subsection{Instability Threshold}\label{instability-threshold}}

Parametric instabilities will occur at any amplitude if there is no
damping, but in practice even a small amount of either collisional or
Landau damping will prevent the instability unless the pump wave is
rather strong. To calculate the threshold, one must introduce the
damping rates \(\Gamma_1\) and \(\Gamma_2\) of the oscillators \(x_1\)
and \(x_2\). Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator} then becomes

\[
\ddot{x_1} + \omega_1^2 x_1 + 2\Gamma_1 \dot{x_1} = 0
\]

For instance, if \(x_1\) is the displacement of a spring damped by
friction, the last term represents a force proportional to the velocity.
If \(x_1\) is the electron density in a plasma wave damped by
electron--neutral collisions, \(\Gamma_1\) is \(v_c/2\) (???)
Examination of Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x1},
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x2}, and
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_dispersion} will show that it is all right
to use exponential notation and let
\(\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}t \rightarrow i\omega\) for \(x_1\) and \(x_2\),
as long as we keep \(E_0\) real and allow \(\bar{x}_1\) and
\(\bar{x}_2\) to be complex. Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x1} and
Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_x2} become

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:parametric_damping}{}{
\begin{aligned}
(\omega_1^2 - \omega^2 - 2i\omega\Gamma_1)x_1(\omega) &= c_1 x_2 E_0 \\
[\omega_2^2 - (\omega-\omega_0)^2 2i(\omega-\omega_0)\Gamma_2]x_2(\omega-\omega_0) &= c_2 x_1 E_0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:parametric_damping}\end{equation}

We further restrict ourselves to the simple case of two waves --- that
is, when \(\omega\simeq\omega_1\) and
\(\omega_0 - \omega\simeq\omega_2\) but \(\omega_0+\omega\) is far
enough from \(\omega_2\) to be nonresonant --- in which case the third
row and column of Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_dispersion} can be
ignored. If we now express \(x_1, x_2\), and \(E_0\) in terms of their
peak values, as in Equation~\ref{eq:oscillator_momentum}, a factor of
1/2 appears on the right-hand sides of
Equation~\ref{eq:parametric_damping}. Discarding the nonresonant terms
and eliminating \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) from
Equation~\ref{eq:parametric_damping}, we obtain

\[
(\omega^2 - \omega_1^2 +2i\omega\Gamma_1)[(\omega_0-\omega)^2 - \omega_2^2 - 2i(\omega_0-\omega)\Gamma_2] = \frac{1}{4}c_1c_2\bar{E}_0^2
\]

At threshold, we may set \(\Im(\omega)=0\). The lowest threshold will
occur at exact frequency matching; i.e.,
\(\omega=\omega_1,\omega_0-\omega=\omega_2\). Then the last equation
gives

\[
c_1c_2(\bar{E}_0^2)_{\text{threshold}} = 16\omega_1\omega_2\Gamma_1\Gamma_2
\]

The threshold goes to zero with the damping of \emph{either} wave.

\hypertarget{physical-mechanism}{%
\subsection{Physical Mechanism}\label{physical-mechanism}}

The parametric excitation of waves can be understood very simply in
terms of the ponderomotive force (Section~\ref{sec:ponderomotive}). As
an illustration, consider the case of an electromagnetic wave
\((\omega_0, \mathbf{k}_0)\) driving an electron plasma wave
\((\omega_2, \mathbf{k}_2)\) and a low-frequency ion wave
\((\omega_1, \mathbf{k}_1)\) (fig:parallelogram\_construction B). Since
\(\omega_1\) is small, \(\omega_0\) must be close to \(\omega_p\).
However, the behavior is quite different for \(\omega_0<\omega_p\) than
for \(\omega_0>\omega_p\). The former case gives rise to the
``oscillating two-stream'' instability (which will be treated in
detail), and the latter to the ``parametric decay'' instability.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:oscillating_2stream}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/oscillating_2stream.png}
\caption{Physical mechanism of the oscillating two-stream
instability.}\label{fig:oscillating_2stream}
}
\end{figure}

Suppose there is a density perturbation in the plasma of the form
\(n_1\cos k_1 x\); this perturbation can occur spontaneously as one
component of the thermal noise. Let the pump wave have an electric field
\(E_0\cos\omega_0 t\) in the \(x\) direction, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:oscillating_2stream}. In the absence of a dc field
\(\mathbf{B}_0\), the pump wave follows the relation
\(\omega_0^2 = \omega_p^2 + c^2k_0^2\), so that \(k_0\approx 0\) for
\(\omega_0\approx\omega_p\). We may therefore regard \(E_0\) as
spatially uniform. If \(\omega_0\) is less than \(\omega_p\) (HOW IS
THIS POSSIBLE???), which is the resonant frequency of the cold electron
fluid, the electrons will move in the direction opposite to \(E_0\),
while the ions do not move on the time scale of \(\omega_0\). The
density ripple then causes a charge separation, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:oscillating_2stream}. The electrostatic charges create a
field \(E_1\), which oscillates at the frequency \(\omega_0\). The
ponderomotive force due to the total field is given by
Equation~\ref{eq:ponderomotive}:

\[
\mathbf{F}_{NL} = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\nabla\frac{\left< (E_0 + E_1)^2\right>}{2}\epsilon_0
\]

Since E0 is uniform and much larger than \(E_1\), only the cross term is
important:

\[
\mathbf{F}_{NL} = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{\left<2E_0E_1\right>}{2}\epsilon_0
\]

This force does not average to zero, since E1 changes sign with E0. As
seen in fig:oscillating\_2stream, \(F_{NL}\) is zero at the peaks and
troughs of \(n_1\) but is large where \(\nabla n_1\) is large. This
spatial distribution causes \(F_{NL}\) to push electrons from regions of
low density to regions of high density. The resulting de electric field
drags the ions along also, and the density perturbation grows. The
threshold value of \(F_{NL}\) is the value just sufficient to overcome
the pressure \(\nabla n_{i1}(k_BT_i + k_BT_e)\), which tends to smooth
the density. The density ripple does not propagate, so that
\(\Re(\omega_1)=0\). This is called the \emph{oscillating two-stream
instability} because the sloshing electrons have a time-averaged
distribution function which is double-peaked, as in the two-stream
instability (Sect. ???).

Echoes in a plasma are the excitement of new waves due to nonlinear
interaction. The excitement may happen at an arbitrarily large time,
which is the main source of difficulties in understanding Landau
damping. Since Landau damping \emph{does not involve collisions or
dissipation}, it is a \emph{reversible} process. That this is true is
vividly demonstrated by the remarkable phenomenon of plasma echoes.

\hypertarget{nonlinear-landau-damping}{%

When the amplitude of an electron or ion wave excited, say, by a grid is
followed in space, it is often found that the decay is not exponential,
as predicted by linear theory, if the amplitude is large. Instead, one
typically finds that the amplitude decays, grows again, and then
oscillates before settling down to a steady value. Although other
effects may also be operative, these oscillations in amplitude are
exactly what would be expected from the nonlinear effect of particle
trapping discussed in Section~\ref{sec:landau_damping}.

\hypertarget{sec:turbulence}{%
\chapter{Turbulence}\label{sec:turbulence}}

Turbulence is perhaps the most beautiful unsolved problem of classical
physics. History of turbulence in interplanetary space is, perhaps, even
more interesting since its knowledge proceeds together with the human
conquest of space. The behavior of a flow which rebels against the
deterministic rules of classical dynamics is called \emph{turbulent}.
Practically turbulence appears everywhere when the velocity of the flow
is high enough. At a first sight turbulence looks strongly irregular and
chaotic, both in space and time: it seems to be impossible to predict
any future state of the motion. However, it is interesting to recognize
the fact that, when we take a picture of a turbulent flow at a given
time, we see the presence of a lot of \emph{different turbulent
structures of all sizes} which are actively present during the motion.
We recognize that the gross features of the flow are reproducible but
details are not predictable. We have to use a \emph{statistical
approach} to turbulence, just as it is done to describe stochastic
processes, even if the problem is born within the strange dynamics of a
deterministic system.

Small fluctuations in plasmas lead to turbulence, and turbulent eddies
can very effectively transport mass, momentum and heat from the hot core
across confining magnetic field lines out to the cooler plasma edge.
Predicting this phenomenon of turbulent-transport is essential for solar
wind study and the understanding and development of fusion reactors.

Turbulence became an experimental science since Osborne Reynolds who, at
the end of 19th century, observed and investigated experimentally the
transition from laminar to turbulent flow. He noticed that the flow
inside a pipe becomes turbulent every time a single parameter, a
combination of the mass density \(\rho\), viscosity coefficient
\(\eta\), a characteristic velocity \(U\), and length \(L\), would
increase. This parameter \(\text{Re} = UL\rho/\eta\) is now called the
\emph{Reynolds number}. When \(\text{Re}\) increases beyond a certain
threshold of the order of \(\text{Re}\simeq 4000\), the flow becomes
turbulent.

Predictability in turbulence can be recast at a statistical level. In
other words, when we look at two different samples of turbulence, even
collected within the same medium, we can see that details look very
different. What is actually common is a generic stochastic behavior.
This means that the global statistical behavior does not change going
from one sample to the other. \emph{Fully developed turbulent flows are
extremely sensitive to small perturbations but have statistical
properties that are insensitive to perturbations}. Fluctuations of a
certain stochastic variable \(\psi\) are defined as the difference from
the average value \(\delta\psi = \psi - \left< \psi \right>\), where
brackets mean some averaging process. There are, at least, three
different kinds of averaging procedures that may be used to obtain
statistically-averaged properties of turbulence:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Space averaging over flows that are statistically homogeneous over
  scales larger than those of fluctuations.
\item
  Ensemble averaging where average is taken over an ensemble of
  turbulent flows prepared under nearly identical external conditions.
  Each member of the ensemble is called a \emph{realization}.
\item
  Time averaging, which is useful only if the turbulence is
  statistically stationary over time scales much larger than the time
  scale of fluctuations. In practice, because of the convenience offered
  by locating a probe at a fixed point in space and integrating in time,
  experimental results are usually obtained as time averages. The
  ergodic theorem (Halmos, 1956) assures that time averages coincide
  with ensemble averages under some standard conditions.
\end{enumerate}

A different property of turbulence is that \emph{all dynamically
interesting scales are excited}, that is, \emph{energy is spread over
all scales} and a kind of self-similarity is observed.

Since fully developed turbulence involves a hierarchy of scales, a large
number of interacting degrees of freedom are involved. Then, there
should be an asymptotic statistical state of turbulence that is
independent on the details of the flow. Hopefully, this asymptotic state
depends, perhaps in a critical way, only on simple statistical
properties like energy spectra, as much as in statistical mechanics
equilibrium where the statistical state is determined by the energy
spectrum (Huang, 1987). Of course, we cannot expect that the statistical
state would determine the details of individual realizations, because
realizations need not to be given the same weight in different ensembles
with the same low-order statistical properties.

It should be emphasized that there are no firm mathematical arguments
for the existence of an asymptotic statistical state. Reproducible
statistical results are obtained from observations, that is, it is
suggested experimentally and from physical plausibility. Apart from
physical plausibility, it is embarrassing that such an important feature
of fully developed turbulence, as the existence of a statistical
stability, should remain unsolved. However, such is the complex nature
of turbulence.

\subsection{Coupling between charged fluid and magnetic
field}\label{coupling-between-charged-fluid-and-magnetic-field}}

Elsässer variables are used to extract the Alfvénic component from MHD.
They are defined as

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{z}^+ &= \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{b} \\
\mathbf{z}^- &= \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{b}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{B}/\sqrt{\mu_0\rho}\).

The perturbations are written as

\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta\mathbf{z}^+ &= \delta\mathbf{v} + \delta\mathbf{b} \\
\delta\mathbf{z}^- &= \delta\mathbf{v} - \delta\mathbf{b}
\end{aligned}
\]

\(\mathbf{z}^\pm\) corresponds to anti-parallel/parallel propagating
modes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Parallel wave:
  \(\delta\mathbf{v}=-\delta\mathbf{b}\Rightarrow \delta\mathbf{z}^+=0, \delta\mathbf{z}^-=2\delta\mathbf{v}\)
\item
  Anti-parallel wave:
  \(\delta\mathbf{v}=\delta\mathbf{b}\Rightarrow \delta\mathbf{z}^+=2\delta\mathbf{v}, \delta\mathbf{z}^-=0\)
\end{itemize}

The incompressible MHD wave equation in fluctuating Elsässer form is:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_elsassar}{}{
\frac{\partial\delta\mathbf{z}^\pm}{\partial t} \mp v_A\nabla_\parallel\delta\mathbf{z}^\pm + \delta\mathbf{z}^\mp\cdot\nabla\delta\mathbf{z}^\pm = -\nabla p
}\label{eq:mhd_elsassar}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:elsassar_divergence}{}{
\nabla\cdot\delta\mathbf{z}^\pm = 0
}\label{eq:elsassar_divergence}\end{equation}

The zero divergence means that there are no forcing or dissipation
terms.

Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_elsassar} unveils the interesting phenonmena in
Alfvénic turbulence study. The second term on the left-hand side is a
linear term (\(v_A\) constant?) that represents propagation of waves
parallel to the mean field. The third term represent the non-linear
interaction of counter-propagating waves, during which energy is
transferred to smaller scales. This is exactly turbulence.

\hypertarget{critical-balance}{%
\subsection{Critical balance}\label{critical-balance}}

If we match the Alfvén (linear) timescale,
\(\tau_A \sim l_\parallel/v_A\), with the nonlinear timescale,
\(\tau_{nl}\sim l_\perp/\delta z\), we have the so-called \emph{critical
balance}

\[
\tau_A = \tau_{nl}
\]

Assume a constant energy cascade rate
\(\epsilon\sim \delta z^2/\tau_{nl}\), and an energy injection rate at
scale L \(\epsilon_L\sim v_A^2/\tau_{nl}=v_A^3/L\). When we match the
two rates and \ldots{} (I have some memory from Nunov's lecture at
Nordita), we have \(k_\parallel\propto k_\perp^{2/3}\). This means that
anisotropy grows with decreasing scale. The power spectra are given as

\[
\begin{aligned}
E(k_\perp) &\propto k_\perp^{-5/3} \\
E(k_\parallel) &\propto k_\parallel^{-2}
\end{aligned}
\]

The critical balance scalings were seen in observations when analysed
with local mean field techniques {[}Chen 2016{]}. However, why this is
the case in nature is still under debate.

\hypertarget{residual-energy}{%
\subsection{Residual Energy}\label{residual-energy}}

Residual energy is the difference in energy between magnetic and
velocity fluctuations. The normalized residual energy is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:residual_energy_normalized}{}{
\sigma_r = \frac{|\delta\mathbf{v}|^2 - |\delta\mathbf{b}|^2}{|\delta\mathbf{v}|^2 + |\delta\mathbf{b}|^2}
}\label{eq:residual_energy_normalized}\end{equation}

\(\sigma_r\) is zero for an Alfvén wave but is generally negative
(\(|\delta\mathbf{b}|^2 > |\delta\mathbf{v}|^2\)) at MHD scales for
solar wind observations, meaning that they are mostly likely turbulence
but not waves.

\hypertarget{sec:turbulence_cross_helicity}{%
\subsection{Normalized Cross
Helicity}\label{sec:turbulence_cross_helicity}}

Cross helicity is the difference in energy between \(\mathbf{z}^+\) and
\(\mathbf{z}^-\) fluctuations (Section~\ref{sec:cross_helicity}). The
normalized cross helicity is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cross_helicity_normalized}{}{
\sigma_c = \frac{|\delta\mathbf{z}^+|^2 - |\delta\mathbf{z}^-|^2}{|\delta\mathbf{z}^+|^2 - |\delta\mathbf{z}^-|^2} = \frac{2\delta\mathbf{v}\cdot\delta\mathbf{b}}{|\delta\mathbf{v}|^2 + |\delta\mathbf{b}|^2}
}\label{eq:cross_helicity_normalized}\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(|\sigma_c|=1\): unidirectional Alfvén waves (no turbulence)
\item
  \(|\sigma_c|\lesssim 1\): imbalanced turbulence
\item
  \(|\sigma_c|=0\): balanced turbulence (or non-Alfvénic fluctuations)
\end{itemize}

The solar wind is typically imbalanced towards the anti-sunward
direction. From Equation~\ref{eq:residual_energy_normalized} and
Equation~\ref{eq:cross_helicity_normalized} we can easily see that

\[
\sqrt{\sigma_r^2 + \sigma_c^2} \le 1
\]

The observed distribution is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:turbulence_residual_energy_cross_helicity}. Note,
however, \(\sigma_r\) depends on how you evaluate \(\delta{b}\). In the
MHD case \(\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{B}/\sqrt{\mu_0\rho}\) is used, but in
the kinetic case there will be an extra coefficient. The results look
pretty different!

\hypertarget{solar-wind-turbulence}{%
\section{Solar Wind Turbulence}\label{solar-wind-turbulence}}

\hypertarget{taylors-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{Taylor's Hypothesis}\label{taylors-hypothesis}}

Solar wind is a supersonic flow (\(v_A/v_{\text{SW}}\ll 1\)), with
advection timescale much shorter than any dynamical timescales in the
plasma. This means that for spacecraft observations, the time series
represents an instantaneous spatial cut through the solar wind plasma.
We can thus relate spacecraft frequency, \(f_{\text{sc}}\), to
wavenumber in the plasma frame, \(k\), in a simple way via

\[
k = \frac{2\pi f_\text{sc}}{v_\text{SW}}
\]

This is often not appropriate in the magnetosheath, and modified
Taylor's hypothesis is required close to the Sun.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:turbulence_v_b}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/turbulence_par_perp_L1.png}
\caption{Wave scale from typical L1 satellite solar wind
observation.}\label{fig:turbulence_v_b}
}
\end{figure}

The wavenumber \(k\) determined from Taylor's hypothesis is really the
flow-aligned component of \(\mathbf{k}\). For a given angle
\(\theta_{vb}\), one cannot distinguish \(k_\perp\) and \(k_\parallel\);
these can be possibly measured for small (\(\sim 0^o\) for
\(k_\parallel\)) and large (\(\sim 90^o\) for \(k_\perp\)) at different
times. In the solar wind, \(P(k_\perp) \gg P(k_\parallel)\), where \(P\)
is the power of perturbation. For a Parker spiral-like magnetic field at
1 AU, the angle between \(\mathbf{B}_0\) and \(\mathbf{v}_\text{sw}\) is
rarely small (\(\sim 45^o\)), the power spectra are typically dominated
by the contribution from the \(k_\perp\) fluctuations
(Figure~\ref{fig:turbulence_v_b}).

\hypertarget{solar-wind-power-spectrum}{%
\subsection{Solar Wind Power Spectrum}\label{solar-wind-power-spectrum}}

\caption{Solar wind power spectrum from Kiyoni+,
2015.}\label{fig:solarwind_power_spectrum}
}
\end{figure}

When we plot the solar wind power spectrum (\(\delta|\mathbf{B}|\)), it
is usually representative of \(k_\perp\). There are three distinct
power-law ranges in the spectrum from spacecraft solar wind observations
(Figure~\ref{fig:solarwind_power_spectrum}):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Injection range:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Large amplitude, low frequency Alfvén waves originating from the
    Sun.
  \item
    The \(f^{-1}\) spectrum is known as the ``pink noise''.
  \item
    Non-interacting
  \item
    Inject energy to the MHD cascade at higher frequencies
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Inertial range:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mostly incompressible Alfvénic turbulence.
  \item
    \(\sim f^{-5/3}\) spectrum (Kolmogorov type)
  \item
    a cascade of energy to smaller scales
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Kinetic range:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Scales at which particles are heated
  \item
    Typically \(f^{-2.8}\) spectrum
  \item
    Possibly KAW (Section~\ref{sec:kaw}) or whistler mode
    (Section~\ref{sec:CPDR}) turbulence
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

When we move to smaller scales, anisotropy increases. This is
demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:turbulence_scale} as a result of
\(k_\perp \gg k_\parallel\), which is also why gyrokinetics is the
theory for turbulence.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:turbulence_scale}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/turbulence_par_perp_scale.png}
\caption{Demonstration of parallel and perpendicular length scales of
turbulence.}\label{fig:turbulence_scale}
}
\end{figure}

Fluctuation modes in the inertial range consists of 90\% incompressible
(Alfvén) modes and 10\% compressible slow/mirror modes. Alfvénic
turbulence is thought to be passive to the compressive modes:
compressive modes scatter off Alfvén modes without affecting them
significantly (i.e.~being decoupled from each other). The compressive
modes are expected to damp \(\sim k_\parallel v_A\). Since
\(k_\perp \gg k_\parallel\), the damp is not significant for compressive
modes, so they tend to be more anisotropic than the Alfvénic turbulence.

\hypertarget{sec:geometry}{%
\chapter{Geometry}\label{sec:geometry}}

This chapter introduces the topology-related concepts in plasma physics,
including ropes, knots, boundaries, and null points. Usually, observers
and modelers have different views of topology because of the tools at
hand: observers have probes which give measurements as a function of
both time and space, while modelers have full spatial-temporal
information under the given resolution. It always amazes me how
observers can deduce the general picture of plasma structures with such
limited data. Incorporating observation experience into physics as well
as diagnosing numerical simulations with physics are our main goals in
studing geometry.

Generally speaking, there are two ways of tackling the geometry
problems: physics-based methods and statistical methods (classical and
machine learning). We may find harmony when combining these two families
and reach optimal results.

\hypertarget{helicity}{%
\section{Helicity}\label{helicity}}

In fluid dynamics, helicity is, under appropriate conditions, an
invariant of the Euler equations of fluid flow, having a topological
interpretation as a measure of \emph{linkage} and \emph{knottedness} of
vortex lines in the flow (Moffatt 1969).

Let \(\mathbf{u}(x,t)\) be the velocity field and
\(\nabla\times\mathbf{u}\) the corresponding vorticity field. Under the
following three conditions, the vortex lines are transported with (or
``frozen in'') the flow:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the fluid is inviscid;
\item
  either the flow is incompressible (\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=0\)), or it
  is compressible with a barotropic relation \(p=p(\rho)\) between
  pressure \(p\) and density \(\rho\);
\item
  any body forces acting on the fluid are conservative. Under these
  conditions, any closed surface \(S\) on which
  \(n\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{u})=0\) is, like vorticity, transported
  with the flow.
\end{enumerate}

Let \(V\) be the volume inside such a surface. Then the helicity in
\(V\) is defined by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:helicity}{}{
H=\int_{{V}}{\mathbf{u}}\cdot\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{u}\right)\,dV
}\label{eq:helicity}\end{equation}

For a localised vorticity distribution in an unbounded fluid, \(V\) can
be taken to be the whole space, and \(H\) is then the total helicity of
the flow. \(H\) is invariant precisely because the vortex lines are
frozen in the flow and their linkage and/or knottedness is therefore
conserved, as recognized by Lord Kelvin (1868). Helicity is a
pseudo-scalar quantity: it changes sign under change from a right-handed
to a left-handed frame of reference; it can be considered as a measure
of the handedness (or chirality) of the flow. Helicity is one of the
four known integral invariants of the Euler equations; the other three
are energy, momentum and angular momentum.

The invariance of helicity provides an essential cornerstone of the
subject topological fluid dynamics and MHD, which is concerned with
global properties of flows and their topological characteristics.

\hypertarget{magnetic-helicity}{%
\section{Magnetic Helicity}\label{magnetic-helicity}}

The helicity of a smooth vector field defined on a domain in 3D space is
the standard measure of the extent to which the field lines wrap and
coil around one another. As to magnetic helicity, this ``vector field''
is magnetic field. It is a generalization of the topological concept of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_number}{linking number} to
the differential quantities required to describe the magnetic field. As
with many quantities in electromagnetism, magnetic helicity (which
describes magnetic field lines) is closely related to fluid mechanical
helicity (which describes fluid flow lines).

If magnetic field lines follow the strands of a twisted rope, this
configuration would have nonzero magnetic helicity; left-handed ropes
would have negative values and right-handed ropes would have positive
values.

Formally,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:magnetic_helicity}{}{
H=\int\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}^3
}\label{eq:magnetic_helicity}\end{equation}

where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(H\) is the helicity of the entire magnetic field
\item
  \(\mathbf{B}\) is the magnetic field strength
\item
  \(\mathbf{A}\) is the vector potential of \(\mathbf{B}\) and
  \(\mathbf{B}=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\)
\end{itemize}

Magnetic helicity has units of \(\text{Wb}^2\) in SI units and
\(\text{Mx}^2\) in Gaussian Units. Note that
\(\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B}\) should not be considered as ``helicity
density'' because of gauge freedom.

It is a conserved quantity in electromagnetic fields, even when magnetic
reconnection dissipates energy. The concept is useful in solar dynamics
and in dynamo theory. Helicity is approximately conserved during
magnetic reconnection and topology changes. Helicity can be injected
into a system such as the solar corona. When too much builds up, it ends
up being expelled through coronal mass ejections. The simple proof in
ideal MHD can be found on Wikipedia.

Magnetic helicity is a gauge-dependent quantity, because \(\mathbf{A}\)
can be redefined by adding a gradient to it (gauge transformation):

\[
\mathbf{A}^\prime = \mathbf{A} + \nabla\phi
\]

However, for perfectly conducting boundaries or periodic systems without
a net magnetic flux, the magnetic helicity is gauge invariant. A
gauge-invariant relative helicity has been defined for volumes with
non-zero magnetic flux on their boundary surfaces. If the magnetic field
is turbulent and weakly inhomogeneous a magnetic helicity density and
its associated flux can be defined in terms of the density of field line
linkages.

The topological properties of a magnetic field are interpreted in terms
of magnetic helicity. The total helicity of a collection of flux tubes
arises from the linking of flux tubes with one another (mutual helicity)
and the internal magnetic structure of each flux tube (self-helicity).
Reconnection changes the topology and magnetic connectivity of flux
tubes. This can also be viewed as a redistribution of self- and mutual
helicities. If total magnetic helicity is approximately conserved, it is
possible to put quantitative limits upon the changes in self- and mutual
helicities. This can be interpreted as the change in magnetic flux tube
linkage (due to reconnection) and amount of twist present in the
reconnected flux tubes. {[}Wright \& Berger, 1989{]}

Simple examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A single untwisted closed flux loop has \(H=0\).
\item
  A single flux rope with a magnetic flux of \(\phi\) that twists around
  itself \(T\) times has a helicity of \(H = T\phi^2\).
\item
  Two interlinked untwisted flux loops with fluxes \(\phi_1\) and
  \(\phi_2\) have \(H=\pm2\phi_1\phi_2\) where the sign depends on the
  sense of the linkedness.
\end{enumerate}

There are generalizations to allow for gauge-invariant definitions of
helicity. {[}Berger \& Field (1984){]} defined the relative magnetic
helicity to be

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:relative_magnetic_helicity}{}{
H = \int_V \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{A}_0\cdot\mathbf{B}_0 dV
}\label{eq:relative_magnetic_helicity}\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{B}_0=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}_0\) is the potential field
inside \(V\) with the same field outside of \(V\) (see also Finn \&
Antonsen 1985).

In toroidal laboratory experiments, it is natural to consider the volume
contained within conducting wall boundaries that are coincident with
closed flux surfaces (i.e., the magnetic field along the wall is
parallel to the boundary).

The time evolution of magnetic helicity is given by

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}H}{\mathrm{d}t} = -2c\int_V \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}dV + 2c\int_S \mathbf{A}_p\times\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
\]

where we choose \(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}_p=0\) and
\(\mathbf{A}_p\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}=0\) on \(S\). The first term
represents helicity dissipation when \(E_\parallel\neq 0\), which is
always zero in ideal MHD. The second term represents helicity fluxes in
and out of the system, for example, flux emergence from the solar
photosphere corresponds to helicity injection in the corona.

\hypertarget{sec:cross_helicity}{%
\section{Cross Helicity}\label{sec:cross_helicity}}

The cross helicity measures the imbalance between interacting waves,
which is important in MHD turbulence
(Section~\ref{sec:turbulence_cross_helicity}). It is given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cross_helicity}{}{
H_C = \int_V \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{B} dV
}\label{eq:cross_helicity}\end{equation}

In ideal MHD, the rate of change of \(H_C\) is

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}H_C}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\oint_S \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}\cdot \Big[ \Big(\frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \frac{p}{\rho}\Big)\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{v}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}) \Big]
\]

This vanishes when
\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{B} = d\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{V}=0\)
along the boundary \(S\) or when the boundary conditions are periodic.
Cross helicity is an ideal MHD invariant when this integral vanishes.

There are discretized forms of cross helicity from the observation point
of view. Check it out if you want to know more.

\[

\sigma_r &< -0.5 \\
|\sigma_c| &< 0.4 \\
|\sigma_m| &> 0.7
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\sigma_m\) is the \emph{normalized reduced magnetic helicity},
which is a measure of \(\mathbf{B}\) rotation. Strictly speaking, the
magnetic helicity depends on the spatial properties of the magnetic
field topology, and thus cannot be directly evaluated from single
spacecraft measurements. However, Matthaeus+ (1982) described a reduced
form of magnetic helicity that can be estimated with measurements from a
single spacecraft based on the magnetic power spectrum. The normalized
reduced magnetic helicity can be estimated by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:reduced_magnetic_helicity}{}{
\sigma_m(\nu, t) = \frac{2\Im[W_T^\ast(\nu, t)\cdot W_N(\nu, t)]}{|W_R(\nu, t)|^2 + |W_T(\nu, t)|^2 + |W_N(\nu, t)|^2}
}\label{eq:reduced_magnetic_helicity}\end{equation}

where \(\nu\) is the frequency associated with the Wavelet function and
the sampling period of the measured magnetic field in the radial
tangential normal (RTN) coordinate system. The spectra \(W_R(\nu, t)\),
\(W_T(\nu, t)\), and \(W_N(\nu, t)\) are the wavelet transforms of time
series of \(\mathbf{B}_{1R}\), \(\mathbf{B}_{1T}\), and
\(\mathbf{B}_{1N}\), respectively; and \(W_T^\ast(\nu,t)\) is the
conjugate of \(W_T(\nu,t)\). From the resulting spectrogram of the
magnetic helicity, \(\sigma_m\), one can determine both the magnitude
and the handedness (chirality) of underlying fluctuations at a specific
scale. A positive value of \(\sigma_m\) corresponds to right-handed
chirality and a negative value to left-handed chirality.

\hypertarget{sec:solarwind}{%
\chapter{Solar Wind}\label{sec:solarwind}}

The \emph{solar wind} is a high-speed particle stream continuously blown
out from the Sun into interplanetary space. It extends far beyond the
orbit of the Earth, and terminates in a shock front, called the
heliopause, where it interfaces with the weakly ionized interstellar
medium. The heliopause is predicted to lie between 110 and 160 AU (1
Astronomical Unit is \(1.5\times 10^{11}\)m) from the center of the Sun.
Voyager 1 \& 2, which were launched in 1977, have passed through the
heliopause, and are still functional!

In the vicinity of the Earth, (i.e., at about 1 AU from the Sun) the
solar wind velocity typically ranges between 300 and 1400
\(\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). The average value is approximately
\(500\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), which corresponds to about a 4
day time of flight from the Sun. Note that the solar wind is both
\emph{super-sonic} and \emph{super-Alfvénic}.

The solar wind is predominately composed of protons and electrons.

Amazingly enough, the solar wind was predicted theoretically by Eugine
Parker in 1958, a number of years before its existence was confirmed
using satellite data. Parker's prediction of a super-sonic outflow of
gas from the Sun is a fascinating scientific detective story, as well as
a wonderful application of plasma physics.

The solar wind originates from the solar corona. The solar corona is a
hot, tenuous plasma surrounding the Sun, with characteristic
temperatures and particle densities of about \(10^6\)K and
\(10^{14}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}\), respectively. Note that the corona is
\emph{far hotter} than the solar atmosphere, or photosphere. In fact,
the temperature of the photosphere is only about 6000 K. It is thought
that the corona is heated by Alfvén waves emanating from the photosphere
together with a turbulent cascading process. The solar corona is most
easily observed during a total solar eclipse, when it is visible as a
white filamentary region immediately surrounding the Sun.

Let us start, following Chapman, by attempting to construct a model for
a static solar corona. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the
corona takes the form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_static}{}{
\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}r} = - \rho\,\frac{G\,M_\odot}{r^2}
}\label{eq:corona_static}\end{equation}

where
\(G= 6.67\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m}^{3}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}\,\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\)
is the gravitational constant, and
\(M_\odot=2\times 10^{30}\,\mathrm{kg}\) is the solar mass. The plasma
density is written

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_mass_density}{}{
\rho\simeq n\,m_p
}\label{eq:corona_mass_density}\end{equation}

where \(n\) is the number density of protons. If both protons and
electrons are assumed to possess a common temperature, \(T(r)\), then
the coronal pressure is given by

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_pressure_constT}{}{
p = 2nk_B T
}\label{eq:corona_pressure_constT}\end{equation}

The thermal conductivity of the corona is dominated by the electron
thermal conductivity, and takes the form (???)

\[
\kappa = \kappa_0\,T^{5/2}
\]

where \(\kappa_0\) is a relatively weak function of density and
temperature. For typical coronal conditions this conductivity is
extremely high: i.e., it is about twenty times the thermal conductivity
of copper at room temperature. The coronal heat flux density is written

\[
\mathbf{q} = -\kappa\nabla T
\]

For a static corona, in the absence of energy sources or sinks, we
require

\[
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q} = 0
\]

Assuming spherical symmetry, this expression reduces to

\[
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}r}\left(r^2\kappa_0\, k_B T^{5/2}\,\frac{dT}{\mathrm{d}r}\right) =0
\]

Adopting the sensible boundary condition that the coronal temperature
must tend to zero at large distances from the Sun, we obtain

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_T_static}{}{
T(r) = T(a)\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{2/7}
}\label{eq:corona_T_static}\end{equation}

The reference level \(r=a\) is conveniently taken to be the base of the
corona, where \(a\sim 7\times 10^5\,\mathrm{km}\),
\(n\sim 2\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}\), and
\(T\sim 2\times 10^{6}\)K.

Equation~\ref{eq:corona_static}, Equation~\ref{eq:corona_mass_density},
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_pressure_constT}, and
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_T_static} can be combined and integrated to give

\[
p(r) = p(a) \exp\left\{\frac{7}{5}\,\frac{G\,M_\odot\,m_p}{2k_B T(a)\,a} \left[\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{5/7}-1\right]\right\}
\]

Note that as \(r\rightarrow\infty\) the coronal pressure tends towards a
finite constant value:

\[
p(\infty) = p(a)\,\exp\left\{-\frac{7}{5}\,\frac{G\,M_\odot\,m_p}{2k_B T(a)\,a} \right\}
\]

There is, of course, nothing at large distances from the Sun which could
contain such a pressure (the pressure of the interstellar medium is
negligibly small). Thus, we conclude, with Parker, that the static
coronal model is unphysical.

Since we have just demonstrated that a static model of the solar corona
is unsatisfactory, let us now attempt to construct a dynamic model in
which material flows outward from the Sun.

\hypertarget{parker-solar-wind-model}{%
\section{Parker Solar Wind Model}\label{parker-solar-wind-model}}

By symmetry, we expect a purely radial coronal outflow. The radial
momentum conservation equation for the corona takes the form

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_mass_cons}{}{
\rho\,u\,\frac{du}{\mathrm{d}r} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}r} - \rho\,\frac{G\,M_\odot}{r^2}
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_mass_cons}\end{equation}

where \(u\) is the radial expansion speed. The continuity equation
reduces to

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_reduced}{}{
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}(r^2\,\rho\,u)}{\mathrm{d}r} = 0
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_reduced}\end{equation}

In order to obtain a closed set of equations, we now need to adopt an
equation of state for the corona, relating the pressure, \(p\), and the
density, \(\rho\). For the sake of simplicity, we adopt the simplest
conceivable equation of state, which corresponds to an \emph{isothermal}
corona. Thus, we have

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_isothermal}{}{
p = \frac{2k_B\rho T}{m_p}
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_isothermal}\end{equation}

where \(T\) is a constant. Note that more realistic equations of state
complicate the analysis, but do not significantly modify any of the
physics results.

Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_reduced} can be integrated to
give

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_integrated}{}{
r^2\,\rho\,u = I
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_integrated}\end{equation}

where \(I\) is a constant. The above expression simply states that the
mass flux per unit solid angle, which takes the value \(I\), is
independent of the radius, \(r\).
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_mass_cons},
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_isothermal}, and
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_integrated} can be combined
together to give

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_governing}{}{
\frac{1}{u} \,\frac{du}{\mathrm{d}r}\left(u^2 - \frac{2k_B T}{m_p}\right) = \frac{4k_B T}{m_p\,r} - \frac{G\,M_\odot}{r^2}
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_governing}\end{equation}

Let us restrict our attention to coronal temperatures which satisfy

\[
T < T_c \equiv \frac{G\,M_\odot\,m_p}{4k_B\,a}
\]

where \(a\) is the radius of the base of the corona. \(T_c\) is the
defined temperature where the right-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing} is zero at \(r=a\). For
typical coronal parameters (see previous section),
\(T_c\simeq 5.8\times 10^6\)K, which is certainly greater than the
temperature of the corona at \(r=a\). For \(T<T_c\), the right-hand side
of Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing} is negative for
\(a<r<r_c\), where (???)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_T_r}{}{
\frac{r_c}{a} = \frac{T_c}{T}
}\label{eq:corona_T_r}\end{equation}

and positive for \(r_c<r<\infty\). The right-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing} is zero at \(r=r_c\),
implying that the left-hand side is also zero at this radius, which is
usually termed the ``critical radius''. There are two ways in which the
left-hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing} can be zero
at the critical radius. Either

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_critical1}{}{
u^2(r_c) = u_c^2 \equiv \frac{2k_B T}{m_p}
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_critical1}\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_critical2}{}{
\frac{du(r_c)}{\mathrm{d}r} = 0
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_critical2}\end{equation}

Note that \(u_c\) is the coronal sound speed.

As is easily demonstrated, if Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_critical1}
is satisfied then \(du/\mathrm{d}r\) has the same sign for all \(r\),
and \(u(r)\) is either a monotonically increasing, or a monotonically
decreasing, function of \(r\). On the other hand, if
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_critical2} is satisfied then
\(u^2-u_c^2\) has the same sign for all \(r\), and \(u(r)\) has an
extremum close to \(r=r_c\). The flow is either super-sonic for all
\(r\), or sub-sonic for all \(r\). These possibilities lead to the
existence of four classes of solutions to
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing}, with the following
properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(u(r)\) is sub-sonic throughout the domain \(a<r<\infty\). \(u(r)\)
  increases with \(r\), attains a maximum value around \(r=r_c\), and
  then decreases with \(r\).
\item
  a unique solution for which \(u(r)\) increases monotonically with
  \(r\), and \(u(r_c) = u_c\).
\item
  a unique solution for which \(u(r)\) decreases monotonically with
  \(r\), and \(u(r_c) = u_c\).
\item
  \(u(r)\) is super-sonic throughout the domain \(a<r<\infty\). \(u(r)\)
  decreases with \(r\), attains a minimum value around \(r=r_c\), and
  then increases with \(r\).
\end{enumerate}

These four classes of solutions are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:parker_sol}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:parker_sol}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures1/img1660.png}
\caption{The four classes of Parker outflow solutions for the solar
wind.}\label{fig:parker_sol}
}
\end{figure}

Each of the classes of solutions described above fits a different set of
boundary conditions at \(r=a\) and \(r\rightarrow\infty\). The physical
acceptability of these solutions depends on these boundary conditions.
For example, both Class 3 and Class 4 solutions can be ruled out as
plausible models for the solar corona since they predict super-sonic
flow at the base of the corona, which is not observed, and is also not
consistent with a static solar photosphere. Class 1 and Class 2
solutions remain acceptable models for the solar corona on the basis of
their properties around \(r=a\), since they both predict sub-sonic flow
in this region. However, the Class 1 and Class 2 solutions behave quite
differently as \(r\rightarrow\infty\), and the physical acceptability of
these two classes hinges on this difference.

Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing} can be rearranged to give

\[
\frac{du^2}{\mathrm{d}r}\left(1-\frac{u_c^{~2}}{u^2}\right) = \frac{4\,u_c^{~2}}{r} \left(1-\frac{r_c}{r}\right)
\]

where Equation~\ref{eq:corona_T_r} and the definition of \(T_c\) have
been used. The above expression can be integrated to give

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:corona_dynamic_sol}{}{
\left(\frac{u}{u_c}\right)^2 -\ln\!\left(\frac{u}{u_c}\right)^2 = 4\,\ln r + 4\,\frac{r_c}{r} + C
}\label{eq:corona_dynamic_sol}\end{equation}

where \(C\) is a constant of integration.

Let us consider the behaviour of Class 1 solutions in the limit
\(r\rightarrow\infty\). It is clear from Figure~\ref{fig:parker_sol}
that, for Class 1 solutions, \(u/u_c\) is less than unity and
monotonically decreasing as \(r\rightarrow\infty\). In the large-\(r\)
limit, Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_sol} reduces to

\[
\ln\frac{u}{u_c} \simeq -2\,\ln r
\]

so that

\[
u\propto \frac{1}{r^2}
\]

It follows from Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_integrated}
that the coronal density, \(\rho\), approaches a finite, constant value,
\(\rho_\infty\), as \(r\rightarrow\infty\). Thus, the Class 1 solutions
yield a finite pressure,

\[
p_\infty= \frac{2k_B\,\rho_\infty\,T}{m_p}
\]

at large \(r\), which cannot be matched to the much smaller pressure of
the interstellar medium. Clearly, Class 1 solutions are unphysical.

Let us consider the behaviour of the Class 2 solution in the limit
\(r\rightarrow\infty\). It is clear from Figure~\ref{fig:parker_sol}
that, for the Class 2 solution, \(u/u_c\) is greater than unity and
monotonically increasing as \(r\rightarrow\infty\). In the large-\(r\)
limit, Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_sol} reduces to

\[
\left(\frac{u}{u_c}\right)^2 \simeq 4\,\ln r
\]

so that

\[
u \simeq 2\,u_c\,(\ln r)^{1/2}
\]

It follows from Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_continuity_integrated}
that \(\rho\rightarrow 0\) and \(r\rightarrow\infty\). Thus, the Class 2
solution yields \(p\rightarrow 0\) at large \(r\), and can, therefore,
be matched to the low pressure interstellar medium.

We conclude that the only solution to
Equation~\ref{eq:corona_dynamic_governing} which is consistent with
physical boundary conditions at \(r=a\) and \(r\rightarrow\infty\) is
the Class 2 solution. This solution predicts that the solar corona
expands radially outward at relatively modest, sub-sonic velocities
close to the Sun, and gradually accelerates to super-sonic velocities as
it moves further away from the Sun. Parker termed this continuous,
super-sonic expansion of the corona the \emph{solar wind}.

Note that while the velocity prediction accords well with satellite
observations, the Parker model's prediction for the density of the solar
wind at the Earth is significantly too high compared to satellite
observations. Consequently, there have been many further developments of
this model. In particular, the unrealistic assumption that the solar
wind plasma is isothermal has been relaxed, and two-fluid effects have
been incorporated into the analysis.

\hypertarget{parker-spiral}{%
\section{Parker Spiral}\label{parker-spiral}}

The \emph{interplanetary magnetic field} (IMF), also called \emph{Parker
spiral}, is the component of the solar magnetic field that is dragged
out from the solar corona by the solar wind flow to fill the Solar
System. Depending on the polarity of the photospheric footpoint, the
heliospheric magnetic field spirals inward or outward; the magnetic
field follows the same shape of spiral in the northern and southern
parts of the heliosphere, but with opposite field direction. These two
magnetic domains are separated by a current sheet (an electric current
that is confined to a curved plane). This heliospheric current sheet has
a shape similar to a twirled ballerina skirt
(Figure~\ref{fig:helio_current_sheet}), and changes in shape through the
solar cycle as the Sun's magnetic field reverses about every 11 years.

\hypertarget{anisotropy-in-the-solar-wind}{%
\section{Anisotropy in the Solar
Wind}\label{anisotropy-in-the-solar-wind}}

Observationally, Pioneer 6 showed that the ion temperature anisotropy in
the solar wind at 1AU generally has \(T_\parallel > T_\perp\), together
with other two interesting discoveries:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  high fluctuations of flow velocity outside the solar ecliptic plane;
\item
  anisotropic ion thermal distribution
  (\(T_\parallel / T_\perp \sim [2,5]\));
\item
  presence of a 3rd species, helium, from charge-to-mass ratio analysis
  of the angular and energy distributions.
\end{enumerate}

It may possibly be explained by the conservation of the 1st adiabatic
invariant (\protect\hyperlink{ref-scarf1967plasma}{Scarf et al.,
1967})(This paper shows how pioneers in our field did real elegant
physics!).

The magnetic moment \(\mu = m v_\perp^2/2B\) is conserved as the
collisionless solar wind flows outward from the sun. Near the solar
equator the mean field magnitude declines with

\[
B_r(r) \simeq B_r(r_0)\Big( \frac{r_0}{r} \Big)^2
\]

and

\[
B_\phi(r) \simeq \frac{\Omega_r}{u(r)}B_r(r)
\]

from the Parker spiral solar wind model and
\(\Omega_r = 2.94\times 10^{-6}\) rad/s being the angular frequency of
the rotation of the sun.

The adiabatic equation in the perpendicular direction indicates that the
perpendicular thermal energy
\(\langle m v_\perp^2/2\rangle = k_B T_\perp\) declines with B. Assuming
in the rest frame the distribution function is a bi-Maxwellian of the
form

\[
f(v) = \Big( \frac{m}{2\pi}  \Big)^{3/2}\frac{1}{k_B T_\perp (k_B T_\parallel)^{1/2}} \exp\Big( -\frac{mv_\perp^2}{2k_B T_\perp} -\frac{mv_\parallel^2}{2k_B T_\parallel} \Big)
\]

The conservation of the total thermal energy

\[
W = \int \mathrm{d}^3v \frac{mv^2}{2}f(v)
\]

yields

\[
W = k_B T_\perp + k_B T_\parallel/2 = \text{const}.
\]

These allows us to evaluate the variations in \(T_\perp\) and
\(T_\parallel\) originating from isotropic distribution on the surface
of the sun. Starting from
\(T_\perp(0.3 AU) = T_\parallel(0.3 AU)\simeq 1.3\times 10^{5}\textrm{K}\),
the predicted anisotropy \(T_\parallel / T_\perp\) at Earth can go
beyond 20! Therefore, in fact, the reasonable question to ask is why the
actual solar wind anisotropy factor is so small. In simulations, we
always apply isotropic distribution in the upstream solar wind
condition, which is primarily due to the fact that we are mostly using
fluid models (i.e.~MHD) for global magnetosphere-solar wind
interactions. For kinetic models, \emph{we need more realistic
distribution setups}.

Well, we know now when pressure anisotropy develops, two kinds of plasma
instabilities can be triggered: firehose when \(T_\perp < T_\parallel\)
and mirror when \(T_\perp > T_\parallel\). Further studies require
kinetic theory to describe their behaviors.

On the other hand, the opposite case, \(T_\perp > T_\parallel\), is also
observed and believed to be related to local ion heating by macroscale
compressions (e.g.~high/low speed streams interaction) or plasma
instabilities (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bame1975evidence}{Bame et al.,
1975}).

The mirror instability criterion as an additional relation to determine
the pressure anisotropy downstream of the shock from the book Plasma
instabilities and nonlinear effects by Hasegawa 1975,

\[
1 + \sum_{\textrm{species}} \beta_\perp \big( 1 - \frac{\beta_\perp}{\beta_\parallel} \big) < 0
\]

\hypertarget{switchbacks}{%
\section{Switchbacks}\label{switchbacks}}

When Parker Solar Probe (PSP) sent back the first observations from its
voyage to the Sun, scientists found signs of a wild ocean of currents
and waves quite unlike the near-Earth space much closer to our planet.
This ocean was spiked with what became known as \emph{switchbacks}:
rapid flips in the Sun's magnetic field that reversed direction like a
zig-zagging mountain road.~

Our current understanding is that switchbacks may be generated from
either magnetic reconnection, turbulence, or plasma velocity shears.
There are models for each, but they all requires more testing from
future PSP data.

\hypertarget{mhd-description}{%
\section{MHD Description}\label{mhd-description}}

Because of the presence of a strong magnetic field carried by the wind,
low-frequency fluctuations in the solar wind are usually described with
MHD. However, due to some peculiar characteristics, the solar wind
turbulence contains some features hardly classified within a general
theoretical framework. (Tu and Marsch 1995) presents a thorough review
of the turbulent phenomena in the solar wind from observations in the
ecliptic. In the 1990s, with the launch of the Ulysses spacecraft,
investigations have been extended to the high-latitude regions of the
heliosphere.

Ruelle and Takens (1971) who showed that a strange attractor in the
phase space of the system is the best model for the birth of turbulence.
This gave a strong impulse to the investigation of the phenomenology of
turbulence from the point of view of dynamical systems. Turbulence in
the solar wind has been used as a big wind tunnel to investigate scaling
laws of turbulent fluctuations, multifractals models, etc. Therefore,
the solar wind can be seen as a very big laboratory where fully
developed turbulence can be investigated not only per se, rather as far
as basic theoretical aspects are concerned.

\hypertarget{sec:shock}{%
\chapter{Shock}\label{sec:shock}}

Consider a subsonic disturbance moving through a conventional neutral
fluid. As is well-known, sound waves propagating ahead of the
disturbance give advance warning of its arrival, and, thereby, allow the
response of the fluid to be both smooth and adiabatic. Now, consider a
supersonic disturbance. In this case, sound waves are unable to
propagate ahead of the disturbance, and so there is no advance warning
of its arrival, and, consequently, the fluid response is \emph{sharp}
and \emph{non-adiabatic}. This type of response is generally known as a
\emph{shock}.

In space, shock is a dissipative structure in which the kinetic and
magnetic energy of a directed plasma flow is partly transferred to
heating of the plasma. The dissipation does not take place, however, by
means of particle collisions for a shock in space. Collisionless shocks
can be divided into \emph{super}- and \emph{sub-critical}: the
\emph{critical Mach number} \(M_A^\ast\) is defined by equating the
normal component of the downstream flow velocity in the shock frame to
the sound speed. (In aerodynamics, the critical Mach number \(M^\ast\)
of an aircraft is the \emph{lowest} Mach number at which the airflow
over some point of the aircraft reaches the speed of sound, but does not
exceed it.) Above the critical Mach number, resistivity alone is unable
to provide all the dissipation needed for the required
\emph{Rankine-Hugoniot} shock jump. Supercritical shocks are important
because they usually produce much greater ion heating than subcritical
shocks. In contrast to sub-critical shocks, resistivity in
super-critical shocks cannot provide all the necessary dissipation for a
shock transition according to the \emph{Rankine--Hugoniot}
relationships. Thus, other processes like wave-particle interactions
provide the dissipation required for supercritical shock formation. This
is the reason why they are able to accelerate particles to high
energies. Note that most of the time we have supercritical bow shock at
Earth, i.e.~the sound speed in the magnetosheath is larger than the bulk
speed.

Let us investigate shocks first in MHD fluids. Since information in such
fluids is carried via three different waves -- namely, \emph{fast} or
\emph{compressional-Alfvén waves}, \emph{intermediate} or
\emph{shear-Alfvén waves}, and \emph{slow} or \emph{magnetosonic waves}
-- we might expect MHD fluids to support three different types of shock,
corresponding to disturbances traveling faster than each of the
aforementioned waves.

In general, a shock propagating through an MHD fluid produces a
significant difference in plasma properties on either side of the shock
front. The thickness of the front is determined by a balance between
convective and dissipative effects. However, dissipative effects in high
temperature plasmas are only comparable to convective effects when the
spatial gradients in plasma variables become extremely large. Hence, MHD
shocks in such plasmas tend to be \emph{extremely narrow}, and are
well-approximated as \emph{discontinuous} changes in plasma parameters.
The MHD equations, and Maxwell's equations, can be integrated across a
shock to give a set of jump conditions which relate plasma properties on
each side of the shock front. If the shock is sufficiently narrow then
these relations become independent of its detailed structure. Let us
derive the jump conditions for a narrow, planar, steady-state, MHD
shock.

\hypertarget{mhd-theory}{%
\section{MHD Theory}\label{mhd-theory}}

The conserved form of MHD equations can be written as:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mhd_conservation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \nabla\times (\mathbf{V}\times \mathbf{B})=0 \\

\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=0

}\label{eq:mhd_conservation}\end{equation}

where

\[
\mathbf{T} = \rho\,\mathbf{V}\,\mathbf{V} + \left(p+ \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\right)\mathbf{I}- \frac{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0}

contributions) stress tensor, \(\mathbf{I}\) the identity tensor,

\[
U = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 + \frac{p}{\gamma-1} + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}
\]

the total energy density, and

\[
\mathbf{u} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2+ \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}p\right)\mathbf{V} + \frac{\mathbf{B}\times (\mathbf{V}\times \mathbf{B})}{\mu_0}
\]

the total energy flux density.

Let us move into the rest frame of the shock. For a 1D shock, suppose
that the shock front coincides with the \(y\)-\(z\) plane. Furthermore,
let the regions of the plasma upstream and downstream of the shock,
which are termed regions 1 and 2, respectively, be \emph{spatially
uniform} and \emph{time-static},
i.e.~\(\partial/\partial t = \partial/\partial x = \partial/\partial y = 0\).
Moreover, \(\partial/\partial x=0\), except in the immediate vicinity of
the shock. Finally, let the velocity and magnetic fields upstream and
downstream of the shock all lie in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The situation
under discussion is illustrated in the figure below.

Here, \(\rho_1\), \(p_1\), \(\mathbf{V}_1\), and \(\mathbf{B}_1\) are
the downstream mass density, pressure, velocity, and magnetic field,
respectively, whereas \(\rho_2\), \(p_2\), \(\mathbf{V}_2\), and
\(\mathbf{B}_2\) are the corresponding upstream quantities.

The basic RH relations are listed in
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shocks_and_discontinuities_(magnetohydrodynamics)}{MHD
shocks}. In the immediate vicinity of the planar shock,
Equation~\ref{eq:mhd_conservation} reduce to

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{x}}{\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(V_x\,B_y-V_y\,B_x)=0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} (\rho\, V_x)}{\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} T_{xx}}{\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} T_{xy}}{\mathrm{d}x}=0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} u_x}{\mathrm{d}x}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Integration across the shock yields the desired jump conditions:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:RH_planar_sol}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\lfloor B_x\rceil=0 \\
\lfloor V_x\,B_y-V_y\,B_x\rceil=0 \\
\lfloor \rho\,V_x\rceil=0 \\
\lfloor \rho\,V_x^{\,2}+p + B_y^{\,2}/2\mu_0\rceil=0 \\
\lfloor \rho\,V_x\,V_y - B_x\,B_y/\mu_0\rceil=0 \\
\Big\lfloor \frac{1}{2}\,\rho\,V^2\,V_x + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\,p\,V_x + \frac{B_y\,(V_x\,B_y-V_y\,B_x)}{\mu_0}\Big\rceil=0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:RH_planar_sol}\end{equation}

where \(\lfloor A \rceil = A_2 - A_1\) is the difference across the
shock. These relations are often called the Rankine-Hugoniot relations
for MHD. There are 6 scalar equations and 12 scalar variables all
together. Assuming that all of the upstream plasma parameters are known,
there are 6 unknown parameters in the problem--namely, \(B_{x\,2}\),
\(B_{y\,2}\), \(V_{x\,2}\), \(V_{y\,2}\), \(\rho_2\), and \(p_2\). These
6 unknowns are fully determined by the six jump conditions. If we loose
the planar assumption, then we typically write the \(x\)-component as
the normal component (\(v_n, B_n\)) and the combined \(y-\) and
\(z-components\) as the tangential component (\(v_t,B_t\)). Luckily this
is still deterministic. However, the general case is very complicated!

The categories of the solution of Equation~\ref{eq:RH_planar_sol} are
shown in the following table. The \(\pm\) signs denote the changes of
the downstream compared with the upstream (\(+\) means increase, \(-\)
means decrease). By definition shocks are transition layers across which
there is a transport of particles, whereas discontinuities are
transition layers across which there is no particle transport.

\hypertarget{coplanarity}{%
\subsection{Coplanarity}\label{coplanarity}}

Knowing that for the shock \(v_n\neq 0\) and
\(\lfloor v_n \rceil \neq 0\), we can eliminate \(\lfloor v_t \rceil\)
from the RH relations listed on Wiki and obtain

\[
\lfloor v_n \mathbf{B}_t \rceil = \frac{B_n^2}{\mu_0 (something) }\lfloor \mathbf{B}_t \rceil
\]

Hence the cross product of the left with the right hand side must
vanish:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:shock_coplanarity}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\lfloor \mathbf{B}_t \rceil \times \lfloor v_n\mathbf{B}_t \rceil = 0 \\
(v_{n1} - v_{n2})(\mathbf{B}_{t1}\times\mathbf{B}_{t2}) = 0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:shock_coplanarity}\end{equation}

The resulting coplanarity theorem implies that the magnetic field across
the shock has a 2-D geometry: upstream and dowstream tangential fields
are parallel to each other and coplanar with the shock normal
\(\hat{n}\).

\hypertarget{sec:parallel_shock}{%
\subsection{Parallel Shock}\label{sec:parallel_shock}}

The first special case is the so-called parallel shock in which both the
upstream and downstream plasma flows are parallel to the magnetic field,
as well as perpendicular to the shock front. In other words,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:parallel_shock}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{V}_1 = (V_1,\,0,\,0),\quad\mathbf{V}_2 = (V_2,\,0,\,0) \\
\mathbf{B}_1 = (B_1,\,0,\,0),\quad\mathbf{B}_2 = (B_2,\,0,\,0)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:parallel_shock}\end{equation}

Substitution into Equation~\ref{eq:RH_planar_sol} yields

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:parallel_shock_relation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{B_2}{B_1} &= 1\\
\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} &= r \\
\frac{v_2}{v_1} &= r^{-1} \\
\frac{p_2}{p_1} &= R \\
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:parallel_shock_relation}\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:eq:parallel_shock_coef}{}{
\begin{aligned}
r &= \frac{(\gamma + 1)M_1^2}{2+(\gamma-1)M_1^2} \\
R &= 1 + \gamma M_1^2 (1-r^{-1}) = \frac{(\gamma+1)r - (\gamma-1)}{(\gamma+1) - (\gamma-1)r}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:eq:parallel_shock_coef}\end{equation}

Here, \(M_1 = v_1/v_{s1}\), where \(v_{s1} = \sqrt(\gamma p_1/\rho_1)\)
is the upstream sound speed. Thus, the upstream flow is supersonic if
\(M_1>1\), and subsonic if \(M_1<1\). Incidentally, as is clear from the
above expressions, a parallel shock is unaffected by the presence of a
magnetic field. In fact, this type of shock is identical to that which
occurs in neutral fluids, and is, therefore, usually called a
\emph{hydrodynamic shock}.

It is easily seen from Equation~\ref{eq:parallel_shock} that there is no
shock (i.e., no jump in plasma parameters across the shock front) when
the upstream flow is exactly sonic: i.e., when \(M_1=1\). In other
words, \(r=R=1\) when \(M_1=1\). However, if \(M_1\neq 1\) then the
upstream and downstream plasma parameters become different (i.e.,
\(r\neq 1\), \(R\neq 1\)) and a true shock develops. In fact, it is
easily demonstrated that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:parallel_shock_coef_range}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1} &\leq r \leq \frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1} \\
0&\leq R \leq \infty \\
\frac{\gamma-1}{2\,\gamma}&\leq M_1^2\leq \infty
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:parallel_shock_coef_range}\end{equation}

Note that the upper and lower limits in the above inequalities are all
attained simultaneously.

The previous discussion seems to imply that a parallel shock can be
either compressive (i.e., \(r>1\)) or expansive (i.e., \(r<1\)). Is
there a preferential direction across the shock? In other words, can we
tell the upstream and the downstream? Yes, with the additional physics
principle of the \emph{second law of thermodynamics}. This law states
that the \emph{entropy} of a closed system can spontaneously increase,
but can never spontaneously decrease. Now, in general, the entropy per
particle is different on either side of a hydrodynamic shock front.
Accordingly, the second law of thermodynamics mandates that the
downstream entropy must \emph{exceed} the upstream entropy, so as to
ensure that the shock generates a net increase, rather than a net
decrease, in the overall entropy of the system, as the plasma flows
through it.

The (suitably normalized) entropy per particle of an ideal plasma takes
the form

\[
S = \ln\left(\frac{p}{\rho^\gamma}\right)
\]

Hence, the difference between the upstream and downstream entropies is

\[
\lfloor S\rceil =\ln R - \gamma\,\ln r
\]

Now, using Equation~\ref{eq:eq:parallel_shock_coef},

\[
r\frac{\mathrm{d}\lfloor S \rceil}{dr} = \frac{r}{R}\frac{dR}{dr} - \gamma = \frac{\gamma(\gamma^2-1)(r-1)^2}{[(\gamma+1)r - (\gamma-1)][(\gamma+1)-(\gamma-1)r]}
\]

Furthermore, it is easily seen from
Equation~\ref{eq:parallel_shock_coef_range} that
\(\mathrm{d}\lfloor S \rceil/dr\ge 0\) in all situations of physical
interest. However, \(\lfloor S \rceil = 0\) when \(r=1\), since, in this
case, there is no discontinuity in plasma parameters across the shock
front. We conclude that \(\lfloor S \rceil<0\) for \(r<1\), and
\(\lfloor S \rceil>0\) for \(r>1\). It follows that the second law of
thermodynamics requires hydrodynamic shocks to be \emph{compressive}:
i.e., \(r\equiv\rho_2 / \rho_1>1\). In other words, the plasma density
must always \emph{increase} when a shock front is crossed in the
direction of the relative plasma flow. It turns out that this is a
general rule which applies to all three types of MHD shock. In the shock
rest frame, the shock is associated with an irreversible (since the
entropy suddenly increases) transition from supersonic to subsonic flow.

The upstream Mach number, \(M_1\), is a good measure of shock strength:
i.e., if \(M_1=1\) then there is no shock, if \(M_1-1 \ll 1\) then the
shock is weak, and if \(M_1\gg 1\) then the shock is strong. We can
define an analogous downstream Mach number,
\(M_2=V_2/(\gamma\,p_2/\rho_2)^{1/2}\). It is easily demonstrated from
the jump conditions that if \(M_1>1\) then \(M_2 < 1\). In other words,
in the shock rest frame, the shock is associated with an irreversible
(since the entropy suddenly increases) transition from supersonic to
subsonic flow. Note that
\(r\equiv \rho_2/\rho_1\rightarrow (\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)\), whereas
\(R\equiv p_2/p_1\rightarrow\infty\), in the limit
\(M_1\rightarrow \infty\). In other words, as the shock strength
increases, the compression ratio, \(r\), asymptotes to a finite value,
whereas the pressure ratio, \(P\), increases without limit. For a
conventional plasma with \(\gamma=5/3\), the limiting value of the
compression ratio is 4: i.e., the downstream density can never be more
than four times the upstream density. We conclude that, in the strong
shock limit, \(M_1\gg 1\), the large jump in the plasma pressure across
the shock front must be predominately a consequence of a large jump in
the plasma \emph{temperature}, rather than the plasma \emph{density}. In
fact, the definitions of \(r\) and \(R\) imply that

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1}\equiv \frac{R}{r}\rightarrow \frac{2\gamma(\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\gamma+1)^2}\gg 1
\]

as \(M_1\rightarrow\infty\). Thus, a strong parallel, or hydrodynamic,
shock is associated with intense plasma heating.

As we have seen, the condition for the existence of a hydrodynamic shock
is \(M_1>1\), or \(V_1 > V_{S\,1}\). In other words, in the shock frame,
the upstream plasma velocity, \(V_1\), must be supersonic. However, by
Galilean invariance, \(V_1\) can also be interpreted as the propagation
velocity of the shock through an initially stationary plasma. It follows
that, in a stationary plasma, a parallel, or hydrodynamic, shock
propagates along the magnetic field with a supersonic velocity.

\hypertarget{sec:perp_shock}{%
\subsection{Perpendicular Shock}\label{sec:perp_shock}}

The second special case is the so-called \emph{perpendicular shock} in
which both the upstream and downstream plasma flows are perpendicular to
the magnetic field, as well as the shock front. In other words,

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perp_shock}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{V}_1 = (V_1,\,0,\,0),\quad\mathbf{V}_2 = (V_2,\,0,\,0) \\
\mathbf{B}_1 = (0,\,B_1,\,0),\quad\mathbf{B}_2 = (0,\,B_2,\,0)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:perp_shock}\end{equation}

Substitution into Equation~\ref{eq:RH_planar_sol} yields

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perp_shock_relation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{B_2}{B_1} &= r\\
\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} &= r \\
\frac{v_2}{v_1} &= r^{-1} \\
\frac{p_2}{p_1} &= R \\
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:perp_shock_relation}\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perp_shock_coef}{}{
R = 1+ \gamma\,M_1^{\,2}\,(1-r^{-1}) + \beta_1^{-1}\,(1-r^2)
}\label{eq:perp_shock_coef}\end{equation}

and \(r\) is a real positive root of the quadratic

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:perp_shock_coef_f}{}{
F(r) = 2\,(2-\gamma)\,r^2+ \gamma\,[2\,(1+\beta_1)+ (\gamma-1)\beta_1 M_a^2]r - \gamma\,(\gamma+1)\,\beta_1\,M_1^2=0
}\label{eq:perp_shock_coef_f}\end{equation}

Here, \(\beta_a = 2\mu_0 p_1/B_1^2\).

Now, if \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the two roots of
Equation~\ref{eq:perp_shock_coef_f} then

\[
r_1 r_2 = -\frac{\gamma(\gamma+1)\beta_1 M_1^2}{2(2-\gamma)}
\]

Assuming that \(\gamma < 2\), we conclude that one of the roots is
negative, and, hence, that Equation~\ref{eq:perp_shock_coef_f} only
possesses one physical solution: i.e., there is only one type of MHD
shock which is consistent with Equation~\ref{eq:perp_shock}. Now, it is
easily demonstrated that \(F(0)<0\) and \(F(\gamma+1/\gamma-1)>0\).
Hence, the physical root lies between \(r=0\) and
\(r=(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)\).

Using similar analysis to that employed in the previous subsection, it
is easily demonstrated that the second law of thermodynamics requires a
perpendicular shock to be compressive: i.e., \(r>1\). It follows that a
physical solution is only obtained when \(F(1)<0\), which reduces to

\[
M_1^{\,2} > 1 + \frac{2}{\gamma\,\beta_1}
\]

This condition can also be written

\[
\mathbf{v}_1^2 > \mathbf{v}_{s1}^2 + \mathbf{v}_{A1}^2
\]

where \(v_{A1} = B_1/\sqrt(\mu_0 \rho_1)\) is the upstream Alfvén speed.
\(v_{+\,1} = (v_{S\,1}^{\,2} + v_{A\,1}^{\,2})^{1/2}\) can be recognized
as the velocity of a fast wave propagating perpendicular to the magnetic
field (Section~\ref{sec:fast_slow}). Thus, the condition for the
existence of a perpendicular shock is that the relative upstream plasma
velocity must be \emph{greater} than the upstream fast wave velocity.
Incidentally, it is easily demonstrated that if this is the case then
the downstream plasma velocity is less than the downstream fast wave
velocity. We can also deduce that, in a stationary plasma, a
perpendicular shock propagates across the magnetic field with a velocity
which exceeds the fast wave velocity.

In the strong shock limit, \(M_1\gg 1\),
Equation~\ref{eq:perp_shock_coef} and
Equation~\ref{eq:perp_shock_coef_f} become identical to
Equation~\ref{eq:eq:parallel_shock_coef}. Hence, a strong perpendicular
shock is very similar to a strong hydrodynamic shock (except that the
former shock propagates perpendicular, whereas the latter shock
propagates parallel, to the magnetic field). In particular, just like a
hydrodynamic shock, a perpendicular shock cannot compress the density by
more than a factor \((\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)\). However, according to
Equation~\ref{eq:perp_shock_relation}, a perpendicular shock compresses
the magnetic field by the same factor that it compresses the plasma
density. It follows that there is also an upper limit to the factor by
which a perpendicular shock can compress the magnetic field.

\hypertarget{oblique-shock}{%
\subsection{Oblique Shock}\label{oblique-shock}}

Let us now consider the general case in which the plasma velocities and
the magnetic fields on each side of the shock are neither parallel nor
perpendicular to the shock front. It is convenient to transform into the
so-called \emph{de Hoffmann-Teller frame} in which
\(|\mathbf{v}_1\times \mathbf{B}_1|=0\), or

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:HT_frame_up}{}{
v_{x1}B_{y1} - v_{y1}B_{x1} = 0
}\label{eq:HT_frame_up}\end{equation}

In other words, it is convenient to transform to a frame which moves at
the local \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) velocity of the
plasma.\footnote{for a parallel shock, the HT frame can be just itself;
  for a perpendicular shock, the HT frame can be chosen by shifting the
  velocity by \(\mathbf{v}_1\) s.t. \(\mathbf{v}_1 = 0\).} It
immediately follows from the jump condition of the magnetic convection
equation that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:HT_frame_down}{}{
v_{x2}B_{y2} - v_{y2}B_{x2} = 0
}\label{eq:HT_frame_down}\end{equation}

or \(|\mathbf{v}_2\times \mathbf{B}_2|=0\). Thus, in the de
Hoffmann-Teller frame, the upstream plasma flow is parallel to the
upstream magnetic field, and the downstream plasma flow is also parallel
to the downstream magnetic field. Furthermore, the magnetic contribution
to the jump condition Equation~\ref{eq:RH_planar_sol} (last eq.) becomes
identically zero, which is a considerable simplification.

Equation~\ref{eq:HT_frame_up} and Equation~\ref{eq:HT_frame_down} can be
combined with the general jump conditions
Equation~\ref{eq:RH_planar_sol} to give

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:oblique_shock_relation}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}&=r \\
\frac{B_{x\,2}}{B_{x\,1}} &= 1 \\
\frac{B_{y\,2}}{B_{y\,1}} &= r\left(\frac{v_{1}^{\,2} - \cos^2\theta_1\,v_{A\,1}^{\,2}}{v_{1}^{\,2}-r\,\cos^2\theta_1\,v_{A\,1}^{\,2}}\right) \\
\frac{v_{x\,2}}{v_{x\,1}} &= \frac{1}{r} \\
\frac{v_{y\,2}}{v_{y\,1}} &= \frac{v_{1}^{\,2} -\cos^2\theta_1\, v_{A\,1}^{\,2}}{v_{1}^{\,2}-r\,\cos^2\theta_1\,v_{A\,1}^{\,2}} \\
\frac{p_2}{p_1} &= 1+\frac{\gamma v_1^2(r-1)}{v_{s1}^2 r}\left[1-\frac{r v_{A1}^2 [(r+1)v_1^2 - 2r v_{A1}^2\cos^2\theta_1]}{2(v_1^2 -r v_{A1}^2\cos^2\theta_1)^2} \right]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:oblique_shock_relation}\end{equation}

where \(v_1 = v_{x1}=v_1\cos\theta_1\) is the component of the upstream
velocity normal to the shock front, and \(theta_1\) is the angle
subtended between the upstream plasma flow and the shock front normal.
Finally, given the compression ratio, \(r\), the square of the normal
upstream velocity, \(v_1^{\,2}\), is a real root of a cubic equation
known as the \emph{shock adiabatic}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:shock_adiabatic}{}{
\begin{aligned}
0 = & (v_1^2 - r\cos^2\theta_1 v_{A1}^2)^2\{ [(\gamma+1) - (\gamma-1)r]v_1^2 - 2r v_{s1}^2 \} \\
& r\sin^2\theta_1 v_1^2 v_{A1}^2 \{ [\gamma+(2-\gamma)r]v_1^2 - [(\gamma+1) - (\gamma-1)r]r\cos^2\theta_1 v_{A1}^2 \}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:shock_adiabatic}\end{equation}

As before, the second law of thermodynamics mandates that \(r>1\).

\textbf{Weak shock limit}

Let us first consider the weak shock limit \(r\rightarrow 1\). In this
case, it is easily seen that the three roots of the shock adiabatic
reduce to the slow, intermediate (or Shear-Alfvén), and fast waves,
respectively, propagating in the normal direction to the shock front:

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_1^{\,2}&=v_{-\,1}^{\,2}\equiv \frac{v_{A\,1}^{\,2}+v_{S\,1}^{\,2}- [(v_{A\,1}+v_{S\,1})^2 -4\,\cos^2\theta_1\,v_{S\,1}^{\,2}\,v_{A\,1}^{\,2}]^{1/2}}{2} \\
v_1^{\,2}&=\cos^2\theta_1\,v_{A\,1}^{\,2} \\
v_1^{\,2}&=v_{+\,1}^{\,2}\equiv \frac{v_{A\,1}^{\,2}+v_{S\,1}^{\,2} + [(v_{A\,1}+v_{S\,1})^2 -4\,\cos^2\theta_1\,v_{S\,1}^{\,2}\,v_{A\,1}^{\,2}]^{1/2}}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

We conclude that slow, intermediate, and fast MHD shocks degenerate into
the associated MHD waves in the limit of small shock amplitude.
Conversely, we can think of the various MHD shocks as \emph{nonlinear}
versions of the associated MHD waves. It is easily demonstrated that

\[
v_{+1} > \cos\theta_1 v_{A1} > v_{-1}
\]

In other words, a fast wave travels faster than an intermediate wave,
which travels faster than a slow wave. It is reasonable to suppose that
the same is true of the associated MHD shocks, at least at relatively
low shock strength. It follows from
Equation~\ref{eq:oblique_shock_relation} that \(B_{y2}>B_{y1}\) for a
fast shock, whereas \(B_{y\,2}<B_{y\,1}\) for a slow shock. For the case
of an intermediate shock, we can show, after a little algebra, that
\(B_{y\,2}\rightarrow -B_{y\,1}\) in the limit \(r\rightarrow 1\). We
can conclude that (in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame) fast shocks refract
the magnetic field and plasma flow (recall that they are parallel in our
adopted frame of the reference) \emph{away} from the normal to the shock
front, whereas slow shocks refract these quantities \emph{toward} the
normal. Moreover, the tangential magnetic field and plasma flow
generally \emph{reverse} across an intermediate shock front. This is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mhd_shock_rest_frame}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:mhd_shock_rest_frame}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/img2229.png}
\caption{Characteristic plasma flow patterns across the three different
types of MHD shock in the shock rest
frame.}\label{fig:mhd_shock_rest_frame}
}
\end{figure}

When \(r\) is slightly larger than unity it is easily demonstrated that
the conditions for the existence of a slow, intermediate, and fast shock
are \(v_1> V_{-\,1}\), \(v_1> \cos\theta_1\,V_{A\,1}\), and
\(v_1> V_{+\,1}\), respectively.

\textbf{Strong shock limit}

Let us now consider the strong shock limit, \(v_1^{\,2}\gg 1\). In this
case, the shock adiabatic yields
\(r\rightarrow r_m=(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)\), and

\[
v_1^{\,2} \simeq \frac{r_m}{\gamma-1}\,\frac{2v_{S1}\sin^2\theta_1\,[\gamma + (2-\gamma)\,r_m]\,v_{A1}^2}{r_m-r}
\]

There are no other real roots. The above root is clearly a type of fast
shock. The fact that there is only one real root suggests that there
exists a critical shock strength above which the slow and intermediate
shock solutions cease to exist. (In fact, they merge and annihilate one
another.) In other words, there is a limit to the strength of a slow or
an intermediate shock. On the other hand, there is no limit to the
strength of a fast shock. Note, however, that the plasma density and
tangential magnetic field cannot be compressed by more than a factor
\((\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)\) by any type of MHD shock.

\textbf{\(\theta_1=0\)}

Consider the special case \(\theta_1=0\) in which both the plasma flow
and the magnetic field are normal to the shock front. In this case, the
three roots of the shock adiabatic are

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_1^2&=\frac{2r\,v_{S1}^2}{(\gamma+1)-(\gamma-1)\,r} \\
v_1^2&=r\,v_{A1}^2 \\
v_1^2&=r\,v_{A1}^2
\end{aligned}
\]

We recognize the first of these roots as the hydrodynamic shock
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:parallel_shock}. This shock is classified
as a slow shock when \(V_{S\,1}<v_{A\,1}\), and as a fast shock when
\(V_{S\,1}> v_{A\,1}\). The other two roots are identical, and
correspond to shocks which propagate at the velocity
\(v_1 =\sqrt{r}\, v_{A\,1}\) and ``switch-on'' the tangential components
of the plasma flow and the magnetic field: it can be seen from
Equation~\ref{eq:oblique_shock_relation} that \(v_{y\,1}=B_{y\,1} =0\)
whilst \(v_{y\,2}\neq 0\) and \(B_{y\,2}\neq 0\) for these types of
shock.

There we have ``switch-on'' and ``switch-off'' shocks which refer to the
generation and elimination of tangential components of the plasma flow
and the magnetic field. Incidentally, it is also possible to have a
``switch-off'' shock which eliminates the tangential components of the
plasma flow and the magnetic field. According to
Equation~\ref{eq:oblique_shock_relation}, such a shock propagates at the
velocity \(v_1=\cos\theta_1\,v_{A\,1}\). Switch-on and switch-off shocks
are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:shock_switch_on_off}.

\textbf{\(\theta_1=\pi/2\)}

Consider another special case \(\theta_1=\pi/2\). As is easily
demonstrated, the three roots of the shock adiabatic are

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_1^{\,2}&=r \left(\frac{2v_{S1}^2 + [\gamma+(2-\gamma)\,r]\,v_{A1}^2} {(\gamma+1)-(\gamma-1)\,r}\right)\\
v_1^{\,2}&=0 \\
v_1^{\,2}&=0
\end{aligned}
\]

The first of these roots is clearly a fast shock, and is identical to
the perpendicular shock discussed in Section~\ref{sec:perp_shock},
except that there is no plasma flow across the shock front in this case.
(IS IT BECAUSE OF THE HT FRAME?) The fact that the two other roots are
zero indicates that, like the corresponding MHD waves, slow and
intermediate MHD shocks do not propagate perpendicular to the magnetic
field.

MHD shocks have been observed in a large variety of situations. For
instance, shocks are known to be formed by supernova explosions, by
strong stellar winds, by solar flares, and by the solar wind upstream of
planetary magnetospheres.

\hypertarget{double-adiabatic-theory}{%
\section{Double Adiabatic Theory}\label{double-adiabatic-theory}}

The classical approach by Chew, Goldberger, and Low
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-cgl1956}{Chew et al., 1956}) utilizes the MHD
framework by assuming isotropic distributions parallel and perpendicular
to the magnetic field, which results in scalar pressures on the two
sides of the shock. This is now known as the CGL theory.

When we shift to the MHD with anisotropic pressure tensor

\[
P_{ij} = p_\perp \delta_{ij} + (p_\parallel - p_\perp)B_i B_j / B^2
\]

where \(p_\perp\) and \(p_\parallel\) are the pressures perpendicular
and parallel w.r.t. the magnetic field, respectively. For the strong
magnetic field approximation, the two pressures are related to the
plasma density and the magnetic field strength by two adiabatic
equations,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{p_\parallel B^2}{\rho^3} \Big) &= 0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{p_\perp}{\rho B} \Big) &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

This is also known as the double adiabatic theory, which is also what
many people remember to be the key conclusion from the CGL theory.
(These are constants at a fixed location in time: it is \emph{not}
correct to apply these across the shock!) Here I want to emphasize the
meaning of \emph{adiabatic} again: this assumes zero heat flux. If the
system is not adiabatic, the conservation of these two quantities
related to the parallel and perpendicular pressure is no longer valid,
and additional terms may come into play such as the stochastic heating.

The general jump conditions for discontinuities in a collisionless
anisotropic magnetoplasma in the CGL approximation were derived by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-abraham1967shock}{Abraham-Shrauner, 1967}).

The general jump conditions for an anisotropic plasma are given by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hudson1970discontinuities}{Hudson, 1970})

\[
\begin{aligned}
\lfloor \rho v_n \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor v_n\mathbf{B}_t - \mathbf{v}_t B_n \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor p_\perp + (p_\parallel - p_\perp)\frac{B_n^2}{B^2} + \frac{B_t^2}{8\pi} + \rho v_n^2 \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor \frac{B_n \mathbf{B}_t}{4\pi}\Big( \frac{4\pi(p_\parallel - p_\perp)}{B^2} - 1 \Big) +\rho v_n \mathbf{v}_t \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor \rho v_n\Big( \frac{\epsilon}{\rho} + \frac{v^2}{2} + \frac{p_\perp}{\rho} + \frac{B_t^2}{4\pi \rho} \Big) + \frac{B_n^2 v_n}{B^2}&(p_\parallel - p_\perp) \\
- \frac{\mathbf{B}_t\cdot\mathbf{v}_t B_n}{4\pi}\Big( 1 - \frac{4\pi(p_\parallel - p_\perp)}{B^2} \Big) \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor B_n \rceil &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\rho\) is the mass density, \(v\) and \(B\) are the velocity and
magnetic field strength. Subscripts \(t\) and \(n\) indicate tangential
and normal components with respect to the discontinuity. (THIS IS IN CGS
UNITS!) Quantities \(p_\perp\) and \(p_\parallel\) are the elements of
the plasma pressure tensor perpendicular and parallel with respect to
the magnetic field. Quantity \(\epsilon\) is the internal energy,
\(\epsilon = p_\perp + p_\parallel/2\), and
\(\lfloor Q \rceil = Q_2 - Q_1\), where subscripts 1 and 2 signify the
quantity upstream and downstream of the discontinuity. These equations
refer to the conservation of physical quantities, i.e.~the mass flux,
the tangential component of the electric field, the normal and
tangential components of the momentum flux, the energy flux, and,
finally, the normal component of the magnetic field. To solve the jump
equations for anisotropic plasma conditions upstream and downstream of
the shock, one has to use an additional equation, since the set of
equations is underdetermined. One common choice is the magnetic
field/density jump ratio.

The following derivations follow
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-erkaev2000solution}{Erkaev et al., 2000}). Let
us introduce two dimensionless parameters, \(A_s\) and \(A_m\), which
are determined for upstream conditions as

\[
\begin{aligned}
A_s &= \frac{p_{\perp 1}}{\rho_1 v_1^2} \\
A_m &= \frac{1}{M_A^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(M_A\) is the upstream Alfvén Mach number. For common solar wind
conditions, both of these parameters are quite small (\(\sim 0.01\)).

For shocks, the tangential components of the electric and magnetic
fields are \emph{coplanar} (Equation~\ref{eq:shock_coplanarity}). Thus,
the components of the magnetic field upstream of the shock are given as
\(B_{n1} = B_1 \cos\theta_1\) and \(B_{t1} = B_1 \sin\theta_1\), where
\(\theta_1\) is the angle between the magnetic field vector and the
vector \(\hat{n}\) normal to the discontinuity. Similarly, the
components of the bulk velocity upstream of the shock are chosen as
\(v_{n1} = v_1 \cos\alpha\) and \(v_{t1} = B_1 \sin\alpha\), where α the
angle between the bulk velocity and the normal component of the
velocity. Furthermore, a parameter \(\lambda\) is used to denote the
pressure anisotropy

\[
\lambda = p_\perp / p_\parallel
\]

and another parameter \(r\) is used to denote the ratio of density

\[
r \equiv \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \frac{v_{n1}}{v_{n2}}
\]

\hypertarget{perpendicular-shock}{%
\subsection{Perpendicular Shock}\label{perpendicular-shock}}

For a perpendicular shock, \(B_n = 0\), we have the conservation
relations reduce to

\[
\begin{aligned}
\lfloor \rho v_n \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor v_n\mathbf{B}_t \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor p_\perp + \frac{B_t^2}{8\pi} + \rho v_n^2 \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor \rho v_n \mathbf{v}_t \rceil &= 0 \\
\lfloor \rho v_n\big( \frac{\epsilon}{\rho} + \frac{v^2}{2} + \frac{p_\perp}{\rho} + \frac{B_t^2}{4\pi \rho} \big) \rceil &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]

The quantities downstream of the discontinuity are

\[
\begin{aligned}
B_{t2} &= r B_{t1} \\
v_{t2} &= v_{t1} \\
p_{\perp 2} &= p_{\perp 1} + \frac{B_{t1}^2}{8\pi}(1-r^2) + \rho_1 v_{n1}^2\big( 1 - \frac{1}{r} \big)
\end{aligned}
\]

Substituting these into the energy equation leads to

\[
\begin{aligned}
2 \lambda_1(3\lambda_2 +1)\xi^3 − \lambda_1(4\lambda_2 +1)(2A_S + A_M +2)\xi^2 \\
+ \lambda_2[2\lambda_1(4A_S + 1 + 2A_M ) + 2A_S ]\xi + A_M \lambda_1 = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\xi = 1/r\).

Now we can do some simple estimations. Assume we have isotropic upstream
solar wind with \(n = 2 \textrm{amu/cc}\),
\(\mathbf{v} = [600, 0, 0] \textrm{km/s}\),
\(\mathbf{B} = [0, 0, -5] \textrm{nT}\) in GSM coordinates, and
\(T = 5\times 10^5 \textrm{K}\). We want to estimate the downstream
anisotropy given a density/tangential magnetic field jump of 3.

λ2 = 3.18660804404319 under jump ratio 3

Another thing to note is that, if you set the jump ratio to 4 (maximum
value when \(\gamma = 5/3\)) in the above calculations, the downstream
anisotropy will become 0.6. This indicates that under this set of
upstream conditions, the jump ratio shall never be close to 4 if the
anisotropy \(T_\perp/T_\parallel > 1\)!

\hypertarget{parallel-shock}{%
\subsection{Parallel Shock}\label{parallel-shock}}

Parallel shocks are more special in that the magnetic field strength
remains unchanged so the equations effectively describe pure gasdynamic
solutions. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kuznetsov2018parallel}{Kuznetsov \&
Osin, 2018}) presents a simplified solution in a 1D parallel shock case
with parallel and perpendicular thermal energy heat fluxes
\(S_\parallel\) and \(S_\perp\) included. Note again the original CGL
theory assumes 0 heat fluxes.

\hypertarget{location-of-shock}{%
\section{Location of Shock}\label{location-of-shock}}

In the observation comparison paper
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-slavin1981solar}{Slavin \& Holzer, 1981}) for
quasi-perpendicular shocks, they concluded that the variations in shock
stand-off distance and shape are ordered by the sonic Mach number
\(M_s\) and not other Mach numbers involve magnetic field. In other
words, they think the bow shock is a gasdynamic structure.

However, even in neutral fluid theory, the determination of shock
location as well as shape is still an ongoing research. Imagine the
simplest scenario where there is a static ball in the air with infinite
mass. Assuming purely homogenous air with known density, velocity and
pressure in the upstream, can you tell me the exact location of shock
stand-off distance with pen and paper?

On top of that, the introduction of EM field complicates the story.
Especially in the case of a parallel shock, the plasmas get ``shocked''
both upstream and downstream, and the stand-off distance of the shock
may not be a single point theoretically. In some sense, normal magnetic
field to the boundary ``thickens'' the shock front.

\hypertarget{earth-bow-shock}{%
\section{Earth Bow Shock}\label{earth-bow-shock}}

Using data from the AMPTE/IRM spacecraft,
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hill1995plasma}{Hill et al., 1995}) have shown
that the double adiabatic equations do not hold in the magnetosheath.
Moreover, the thermal behaviour of the magnetosheath is studied by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-phan1996subsolar}{Phan et al., 1996}) using WIND
spacecraft data. They report that most parts of the magnetosheath are
marginally mirror unstable: electron observations showed
\(T_{e\perp} / T_{e\parallel} \sim 1.3\) in the magnetosheath.

\hypertarget{sec:magnetosphere}{%
\chapter{Magnetosphere}\label{sec:magnetosphere}}

The big picture when considering the interaction of the solar wind and
the magnetosphere is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Is there something that can penetrate from the solar wind into the
  magnetosphere?
\item
  Is there something that can be triggered from the interaction?

  Is a physical process internally or externally driven?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{ulf-waves}{%
\section{ULF Waves}\label{ulf-waves}}

Ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves refer to waves within frequency range
{[}0.001, 10{]} Hz. The name does not tell us anything about their
physical origin, but simply observational fact. At Earth's
magnetosphere, this frequency range overlaps largely with the MHD waves.
This is the reason why early pioneers in space physics relied on MHD
theory for large spatial and temporal scales to explain the physics
behind these waves, albeit some deviations and deficiencies which
require more refined models such as the Vlasov description. ULF waves
permeate the near-Earth plasma environment and play an important role in
its dynamics, for example in transferring energy from the solar wind to
the magnetosphere or accelerating electrons in the Earth's radiation
belts.

ULF waves were originally called micropulsations or magnetic pulsations
since they were first observed by ground magnetometers. ULF pulsations
are classified into two types: \emph{pulsations continuous (Pc)} and
\emph{pulsations irregular (Pi)} with several subclasses (Pc1--5 and
Pi1--2) according to their frequencies and durations. The division is
based on their physical and morphological properties, and the boundaries
are not strict.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Notation & Period Range {[}s{]} & Property \\
\midrule
\endhead
Pc1 & 0.2 - 5 & EMIC \\
Pc2 & 5 - 10 & EMIC, Mirror \\
Pc3 & 10 - 45 & Foreshock, FLR, Mirror \\
Pc4 & 45 - 150 & FLR \\
Pc5 & 150 - 600 & SW, FLR \\
& & \\
Pi1 & 1 - 40 & \\
Pi2 & 40 - 150 & \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

With respect to polarization, field line resonant ULF waves can be
categorized into three modes: \emph{compressional}
(\(\Delta B_\parallel,\, \Delta E_\phi\)), \emph{poloidal}
(\(\Delta B_r,\, \Delta E_\phi\)), and \emph{toroidal}
(\(\Delta B_\phi,\, \Delta E_r\)). Here, \(B_r\) (\(E_r\)),
\(B_\parallel\), and \(B_\phi\) (\(E_\phi\)) are the radial, parallel
(or compressional), and azimuthal components in the local magnetic field
system, respectively. Referring to the basic MHD theory, the
compressional modes are fast modes, whereas the poloidal and toriodal
modes are Alfvén modes. The perturbed EM fields are related by
\(\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega} \times \mathbf{E}_1\). Think
of a closed field line near the equatorial plane inside the
magnetosphere: if the wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) is along the field
line, i.e.~\(\mathbf{k} = (0,0,k_z)\), then there will be two cases for
the EM field: poloidal where \(\mathbf{E}_1\) in \(\hat{\phi}\),
\(\mathbf{B}_1\) in \(\hat{r}\) and toroidal where \(\mathbf{E}_1\) in
\(\hat{r}\), \(\mathbf{B}_1\) in \(\hat{\phi}\). If the wave vector
\(\mathbf{k}\) is perpendicular to the field line,
i.e.~\(\mathbf{k} = (k_x, 0, 0)\), since there is no \(E_\parallel\) in
MHD, we only have one option \(\mathbf{E}_1\) in \(\hat{\phi}\) and
\(\mathbf{B}_1\) in \(\hat{z}\). A phase shift is allowed, and actually
in real observations (e.g.~THEMIS) it is rare that you can find B and E
changing in-phase.

\end{itemize}

At Earth, Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are typically
observed in Pc1 and Pc2 range. In the outer radiation belt, the
frequency typically ranges between 0.1 to 5 Hz. The characteristic fine
structure appearance of ``pearl'' Pc1 waves was attributed to dispersive
field-aligned wave packet propagation in the LH ion mode on successive
bounces between hemispheres. However, this still lacks observation
support. Spacecraft measurements have shown that EMIC wave propagation
is almost exclusively away from the equator at latitudes greater than
about \(11^o\), with minimal reflection at the ionosphere.

The preferential region of occurrence of EMIC waves is known to be the
afternoon magnetic local time (MLT) sector from ∼12:00 to ∼18:00 MLT in
the region near the plasmapause and the plasmaspheric plume.

\textbf{Mirror Instability \& Ion Cyclotron Instability}

Already, early observations in the 1970s have shown that the
magnetosheath is populated by intense magnetic field fluctuations at
time sclaes from 1 s to 10 s of seconds. Later research based primarily
on data from ISEE and AMPTE satellites has shown that the mirror mode
waves (Section~\ref{sec:mirror}) and kinetic Alfvén ion cyclotron (AIC)
waves (i.e.~EMIC waves) constitute a large majority of magnetosheath ULF
waves:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  AIC/EMIC are found predominantly near the bow shock and in the plasma
  depletion layer\footnote{The plasma depletion layer (PDL) is a layer
    on the sunward side of the magnetopause with lower plasma density
    and higher magnetic field compared to the corresponding upstream
    magnetosheath value.}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-song1994identification}{Song et al., 1994}),
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hubert1998nature}{Hubert et al., 1998}).
\item
  Mirror mode waves dominate in the central and downstream magnetosheath
  but can occur immediately downstream of quasi-perpendicular shocks
  too. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hubert1989observation}{Hubert et al.,
  1989})
\item
  ULF waves are generally stronger in the dayside magnetosheath.
\item
  More frequency EMIC wave occurrence during quasi-parallel shocks.
\end{enumerate}

The ion cyclotron instability responsible for the generation of AIC
waves often grows under the same conditions as the mirror instability
and in the linear approximation should dominate in lower \(\beta\)
plasmas. The mirror instability, on the other hand, should dominate in
high ion \(\beta\) plasmas
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lacombe1995waves}{Lacombe \& Belmont, 1995}).
Since the initial confirmation of the existence of mirror modes in the
Earth's magnetosheath, they have been observed throughout the
heliosphere. A long-standing puzzle in space plasmas is the fact that
\emph{mirror modes are often the dominant coherent magnetic structures
even for low \(\beta\) plasmas}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:mirror_vs_emic}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/mirror_vs_emic_wave.png}
\caption{Mirror mode waves vs.~EMIC waves in the
magnetosphere.}\label{fig:mirror_vs_emic}
}
\end{figure}

People tried to find an answer to this puzzle. A bunch of studies in
late 1980s and early 1990s (e.g.~{[}Gary+{]}) argued that the presence
of \(\text{He}^{++}\) tends to increase the EMIC threshold while the
mirror mode growth is less affected by the presence of
\(\text{He}^{++}\) ions. Yoshiharu Omura and his student Shoji presented
another possibility in 2009 with hybrid PIC simulations that even though
EMIC modes have higher linear growth rate, they saturates an an earlier
stage than the mirror modes, especially in higher dimensions (by
comparing 2D and 3D results), so that mirror mode waves can gain more
free energy from temperature anisotropy.

\hypertarget{pc3-pc4}{%
\subsection{Pc3 \& Pc4}\label{pc3-pc4}}

As already noted above, in the beginning when people proposed the ULF
wave Pc divisions, many underlying physics are still unclear. The
boundaries are chosen based on the observation data back then and does
not necessarily contain any physical meaning.

ULF waves in the Pc3 range, with periods between 10-45 s, are a common
feature of the dayside magnetosphere, where they are frequently observed
both by spacecraft and ground-based observatories. They are thought to
originate from the ion foreshock, extending upstream of the Earth's
quasi-parallel bow shock (the angle between IMF and shock normal
\(\theta_{Bn}\le 45^o\)). There, ULF waves in the Pc3 frequency range
are produced by \emph{ion beam instabilities}, due to the interaction of
shock-reflected suprathermal ions with the incoming solar wind.

For the foreshock-related Pc3/4 waves, we have the following picture.
After foreshock waves are generated, they propagate through the
magnetosheath (with very few observations) and reach the magnetopause.
They enter the dayside magnetopause and travel antisunward into the
magnetosphere as compressional Pc3 fluctuations, transporting the wave
energy towards the nightside. In the inner magnetosphere, they may
couple to Alfvénic field line resonances (FLRs), where their frequency
matches the eigenmodes of the Earth's magnetic field lines. Pc3 FLRs was
observed at low latitudes and Pc4 at midlatitudes {[}Yumoto+, 1985{]}.
The amplitude of the compressional mode decays when moving further into
the magnetosphere, yet they can sometimes be observed all the way to the
midnight sector. Compressional Pc3 wave power associated with
transmitted foreshock waves is confined near the equator. Statistical
study also shows that equatorial Pc3 wave power is stronger in the
prenoon or noon sector (under various geomagnetic activity levels),
consistent with the foreshock extending upstream of the dawn flank bow
shock for a Parker-spiral IMF orientation. However, contrary to Pc5
pulsations (150-600 s), Pc3 wave activity does \emph{not} show a clear
correlation with the level of geomagnetic disturbances.

Also, note that not all Pc3 waves are related to foreshock waves, thus
we may have different survey results about the distribution of Pc3
waves. This hints the fact that we are far from understanding the whole
physical mechanism of wave generation.

There are several mechanisms by which Pc3-4 ULF waves may propagate to
high latitudes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Harmonics of fundamental mode Pc5 resonances. Such harmonics would be
  expected to exhibit the same form of amplitude and phase properties
  that characterize FLRs and should occur at the same time as the
  fundamental.
\item
  Cavity modes (Section~\ref{sec:flr}).
\item
  Fast mode waves propagate without mode conversion through the
  magnetosphere directly to the ionosphere. Such waves are subject to
  refraction and diffraction on their passage through the magnetosphere
  and may be directed to high latitudes via Fermat's Principle (???).
\item
  Transistor model that invokes beams of precipitating \emph{electrons}
  {[}Engebretson+ 1991{]} (???). The transistor model requires no wave
  mode coupling or wave propagation across field lines, rather the
  modulated precipitation of electrons in response to pressure
  fluctuations in the magnetosheath. The latter are attributed to the
  upstream ion-cyclotron resonance mechanism. The modulated electron
  beams convey wave information from the outer magnetosphere region
  containing the parent population of trapped electrons, to the
  near-cusp ionosphere. The resultant periodic precipitation would
  modulate the ionospheric conductivity and hence ionospheric currents
  equatorward of the cusp. Overhead field lines could then be excited by
  these modulated currents equatorward of the cusp, with the same
  frequency as the modulated electrons. Engebretson likened this
  behavior to that of a
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ukDKVHnac4}{transistor}, where
  a small base current modulates a larger flow from collector to
  emitter. These ULF waves are characterized by noise-like appearance
  and low coherence lengths.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{pc5}{%
\subsection{Pc5}\label{pc5}}

We learned from ground, ionospheric, and space observations about the
existence of \emph{only one or at least a few} resonant field line
vibrations (i.e.~eigenoscillations) in the Pc5 range in the
magnetosphere. As the Alfvén velocity is varying in the radial direction
and as most sources of magnetospheric hydromagnetic waves are broadband
sources, the resonance condition can be matched at an infinite number of
geomagnetic field lines. Thus, every field line should be in resonance
for a broad enough energy source. Therefore the observational fact of
``magic'' frequencies requires a magnetospheric frequency selection
rule. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivelson1985resonant}{Kivelson \&
Southwood, 1985}) suggested that perturbations due to a broadband source
at, e.g., the magnetopause first couple to the discrete
eigenoscillations of global compressional eigenmodes. These narrow band
compressional modes then couple to Alfvénic perturbations due to the
field line resonance mechanism. The global modes thus select the
frequency components participating in the resonant coupling. An
alternative way of selection has been proposed by {[}Fujita+, 1996{]},
who demonstrated that the K-H instability at the surface of a
non-uniform magnetospheric plasma introduces dispersive properties of
the unstable waves, which then gives rise to a narrower source spectrum.
Thus, the field line resonance concept as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:flr} is able to explain the major features of observed
resonant ULF pulsations in the terrestrial magnetosphere.

\hypertarget{bow-shock}{%
\section{Bow Shock}\label{bow-shock}}

Bow shock is the shock (Section~\ref{sec:shock}) resulted from the
interaction of supersonic, super-Alfvénic solar wind with the
magnetosphere of an astrophysical object.

\hypertarget{foreshock}{%
\subsection{Foreshock}\label{foreshock}}

The word ``foreshock'' is borrowed from geophysics for an earthquake
that occurs before a larger seismic event (the ``mainshock'') and is
related to it in both time and space. In space physics, \emph{foreshock}
is the region upstream from the bow shock that is magnetically connected
to the bow shock and contains both solar wind plasma and also charged
particles backstreaming from the bow shock. It is typically associated
with quasi-parallel shocks, as it is much easier for charged particles
to move freely along the normal direction of the shock if it is aligned
with \(\mathbf{B}\). If their speed relative to the ambient plasma is
fast enough, plasma shocks without Coulomb collisions cannot dissipate
all the incoming plasmas; some of them have to ``return''. The
counter-streaming between the foreshock plasma and the incoming plasma
is very unstable and thus excites many types of waves.

The dominant wave mode in the ion foreshock is produced by the
\emph{ion-ion beam right-hand instability} and has a typical period
around 30 s in Earth's foreshock. Their exact period however varies
significantly depending on the solar wind conditions, in particular the
IMF strength, between 10 and 80 s. One easy way to think about this is
by remembering the gyrofrequency \(\omega_c=qB/m\): the beam
instabilities are associated with the cyclotron resonance, and the
gyrofrequency is directly related to \(B\). Their wavelength is of the
order of \(1\,\text{R}_\text{E}\) and they are left-hand polarized in
the spacecraft frame. Their intrinsic polarization is however
right-handed, indicative of a fast mode. The polarization reversal is
due to the waves attempting to propagate sunward, while they are
effectively carried earthward by the faster solar wind flow. The fast
mode is also consistent with the observed positively correlated magnetic
field strength and plasma density fluctuations.

An interesting question arises about the transmission of these fast
waves through the bow shock into the downstream. A list of possible
mechanisms are summarized in
Figure~\ref{fig:foreshock_wave_transmission}.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-turc2022transmission}{Turc et al., 2022}) argued
that the earthward magnetosonic disturbances can then propagate to and
disturb the magnetopause, whereas shock reformation and mode conversion
play only minor roles.

\end{figure}

As usual in plasma physics, accompanying the ion foreshock we have
electron foreshock at a much smaller scale.

The formation of ion/electron foreshocks requires counter-streaming of
ions and electrons, respectively. Since there is only one velocity for
each species in the electron/ion two-fluid equations, it is not possible
to trigger this instability in a multi-moment model. Theoretically we
may have an extremely simplified case where the ion counter-streaming is
represented by two ion fluids, but there are very few studies on this
topic. The minimum requirement may be gyrokinetics.

Magnetosheath jets are regions of high dynamic pressure. Think of jets
as raindrops in the magnetosheath falling on the magnetopause. They are
widely associated with the quasi-parallel magnetosheath, suggesting that
their origin is tied to the interactions between the foreshock and the
bow shock.

The formation of magnetosheath jets may be related to both external and
internal drivings.

Dungey (1961) was the first to propose a cycle of magnetospheric
convection driven by magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetosphere.
Magnetic field connected on the dayside of Earth is transported by the
solar wind to the night side where it forms a long tail behind the
Earth. This transfer of flux to the nightside forces the magnetosphere
to undergo systematic changes in configuration that eventually lead to
nightside magnetic reconnection, which returns flux to the dayside along
the flanks of the magnetosphere via the different response modes.

\hypertarget{sec:iono}{%
\chapter{Ionosphere}\label{sec:iono}}

Ionosphere is like a transition region from neutral gas to plasma.
Therefore, collisions as well as kinetic effects may become important.
Section~\ref{sec:collision_ionized} presents some basic physics related
to the collisional effect in the ionosphere.

\hypertarget{current-systems}{%
\section{Current Systems}\label{current-systems}}

Electric fields associated with the viscous interaction and
reconnection-driven plasma flow are transmitted along field lines to the
ionosphere where they drive currents through the ionosphere. The high
latitude FAC are known as \emph{region-1 currents}, while the lower
latitude currents are called \emph{region-2 currents}. The ionospheric
current connecting these two FAC systems flows parallel to the projected
electric field and is called the \emph{Pedersen current}. Since the
Pedersen current flows through a resistive ionosphere in the direction
of the electric field it causes Ohmic heating
\(\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{E}>0\). The two shells of FAC form a solenoid
so that the magnetic perturbations they create are confined to the
region between them and cannot be detected on the ground. Because of the
interaction of the motion of ionized gases with the neutral atmosphere,
the ions and electrons undergo different drift motion. Ions, due to
higher collision rates with the neutral atmosphere, have a component of
motion perpendicular to the \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) drift
direction, while the electrons generally follow
\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\). The non-dissipative
(\(\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{E}=0\)) Hall current flows at right angles to
both the electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic effects of the Hall
current driven by the region-1 and 2 currents can be observed on the
ground and are known as the DP-2 current system.

In the context of ionospheric energy dissipation, the different current
systems can be classified into two types based on how energy is
processed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If the ionospheric motion and dissipation is coupled directly to the
  solar wind, the system is said to be ``directly-driven''. The
  directly-driven process manifests itself as the DP-2 (two cell
  pattern) ionospheric current system.
\item
  If magnetic energy is first stored in the tail lobes and then released
  some time later, driving additional convection and field-aligned and
  ionospheric currents, it is called ``unloading'', and is associated
  with the DP-1 (substorm current wedge) current system.
\end{enumerate}

Both processes cause precipitation of charged particles that also
deposit energy in the atmosphere.

The characteristic feature of the driven DP-2 current system is the
existence of the eastward and westward electrojets flowing toward
midnight along the auroral oval. Rough measures of the strength of these
currents are the \emph{auroral upper} (AU) and \emph{auroral lower} (AL)
indices. These are respectively the largest positive northward magnetic
perturbation (H) measured on the ground under the eastward electrojet by
any magnetic observatory in the afternoon to dusk sector, and the
largest negative southward perturbation measured in the late evening to
morning sector. Both AU and AL begin to grow in intensity soon after the
IMF turns southward and dayside reconnection begins. The characteristic
feature of the unloading DP-1 current system is the sudden development
of an additional westward current that flows across the bright region of
the expanding auroral bulge. This is the ionospheric segment of the
substorm current wedge. The onset of this current is recorded in the AL
index as a sudden decrease, corresponding to an increase in intensity of
the westward current.

\hypertarget{sec:MI_coupling}{%
\section{M-I Coupling}\label{sec:MI_coupling}}

Ionospheric properties, principally conductivity, provide boundary
conditions for magnetospheric convection, and the ionosphere is often
treated as a passive part of the system. Especially during substorms,
however, the boundary conditions change in a time-dependent and
spatially localized fashion, allowing ionospheric feedback that can
alter the magnetospheric dynamics. The coupling from the ionospheric
perspective differs primarily in that the ionospheric conductance is
anisotropic due to the influence of the neutral atmosphere, involving
Hall as well as Pedersen conductivity. These conductivities are altered
both by the connecting currents and the precipitating electrons
associated with upward field-aligned currents, which increase Pedersen
conductivity and field line tying. An important role is also played by
field-aligned electric fields, set up locally, primarily in upward
field-aligned current regions, which are the cause of auroral
intensifications and, specifically auroral arcs.

For magnetosphere simulations, the simplest inner boundary is treated as
a conducting sphere (\(\mathbf{B}_\text{normal}=0\),
\(\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{v}=0\)). However, this is often not realistic
enough to reveal the nature. In magnetosphere simulations, the location
of tail main reconnection site will be closer to the Earth by simply
applying a conducting boundary. The next level extension is to employ a
magnetospheric-ionospheric electrostatic coupling model. This means that
we seek nonzero \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) at the inner boundary.
The inner boundary, where the MHD quantities are connected to the
ionosphere, is taken to be a shell of radius \(r_\text{in}\)
(e.g.~\(r_\text{in}\sim 3\,\text{R}_\text{E}\)). The ionosphere locates
at \(r_\text{ion}\sim 1000\,\text{km}\sim 0.15\,\text{R}_\text{E}\).
Ideally \(r_\text{in}\) shall be as close to \(r_\text{ion}\) as
possible, but typically it is restricted by computational limitations,
such as extraneously high Alfvén speeds and very large \(\mathbf{B}\)
field gradients closer to the Earth. Inside this shell we do not solve
the governing equations (MHD/PIC/Vlasov), but assume a static dipole
field. The important physical processes within the shell are the flow of
\emph{field-aligned currents} (FACs) and the closure of these currents
in the ionosphere. At each time step,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The magnetospheric FACs are mapped along the field lines from the
  inner boundary to the ionosphere assuming
  \(j_\parallel/B=\text{const.}\), which are the input to the
  ionospheric potential equation
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-raeder1995}{Raeder et al., 1995})
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ionosphere_potential}{}{
\nabla\cdot(\pmb{\Sigma}\cdot\nabla\Phi) = -j_\parallel\sin I
}\label{eq:ionosphere_potential}\end{equation}

where \(\pmb{\Sigma}\) is the conductance tensor, \(\Phi\) is the
electric potential, \(j_\parallel\) is the mapped FAC density with the
downward considered positive and corrected for flux tube convergence,
and \(I\) is the inclination of the dipole field at the ionosphere,
\(\sin I=\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}-I)=\hat{b}\cdot\hat{r}\).

There is another form derived by {[}Wolf 1983{]}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ionosphere_potential2}{}{
\nabla_\perp\cdot
\begin{pmatrix} \sigma_P/\cos^2\delta & -\sigma_H\cos\delta \\ \sigma_H/\cos\delta & \sigma_P \end{pmatrix} \cdot\nabla_\perp\Phi =
j_\parallel\cos\delta
}\label{eq:ionosphere_potential2}\end{equation}

where \(\delta\) is the magnetic field dip angle:

\[
\cos\delta = -2\frac{\cos\theta}{\sqrt{1+3\cos^2\theta}}
\]

for the northern hemisphere, where \(\theta\) is the polar angle
(magnetic colatitude). I DON'T KNOW THE RELATION BETWEEN THESE TWO!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Equation~\ref{eq:ionosphere_potential} is solved on the surface of a
  sphere \(r=r_\text{ion}\). Commonly there are two types of boundary
  conditions: (1) \(\Phi=0\) at the equator
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-raeder1995}{Raeder et al., 1995}), or (2)
  constant potential at or near the low‐latitude boundary (e.g.~LFM,
  BATSRUS). From here, one can either choose a static analytic model of
  Hall and Pederson conductance that accounts for multiple physics, or
  simply adopt a uniform Pederson conductance, or the height-integrated
  conductivity, \(\Sigma_p = 5\,\text{Siemens}\), while the Hall
  conductance \(\Sigma_H\) is assumed to be zero. The latter one is
  simplified to solve
\end{enumerate}

\[
\nabla^2\Phi = -j_\parallel\sin I/\Sigma_p
\]

A more realistic conductance requires considering EUV and diffuse
auroral contributions (???) as well. The solar EUV contribution to
\(\pmb{\Sigma}\) is considered constant in time, but naturally it varies
with the solar zenith angle. For example, the empirical formulas by
{[}Moen and Brekke 1993{]} can be used. The solar EUV radiation is
approximated by the 10.7 cm radio flux (commonly known as \emph{F10.7}),
a widely used proxy solar UV activity, whose standard values is taken to
be \(100\times 10^{-22}\,\text{W}/\text{m}^2\).

The total conductance can be then expressed as

\[
\Sigma_{P,H} = \sqrt{(\Sigma_{P,H}^{e-})^2 + (\Sigma_{P,H}^{\text{UV}})^2}
\]

This is because \(\sigma_{P,H}\propto n_e\), which in a stationary state
is proportional to the square root of the production rate, and it is the
production rates that can be summed linearly. (???)

Does this look well? Not yet. We know that while the high‐latitude
ionospheric convection is driven by the solar wind and magnetosphere
interaction, at lower latitudes atmospheric neutral winds start to
dominate. The next level approximation needs to take this into account.
Because there is a gap between \(r_\text{ion}\) and \(r_\text{in}\), the
ionospheric footprint of their grid has a low‐latitude boundary
somewhere in the midlatitudes, e.g., 45° when
\(r_\text{in}\sim 2\,\text{R}_\text{E}\) (Figure~\ref{fig:MI_BC}).
Global magnetospheric models, unless they are fully coupled to models of
the inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere, lack details of the
ionospheric convection at latitudes equatorward of their low‐latitude
ionospheric boundary. To some extent, such details can be translated to
the global model via the low‐latitude boundary condition used to solve
Equation~\ref{eq:ionosphere_potential2}. The easy way is to set the
ionospheric potential to zero everywhere on the boundary. This
corresponds to no flow across the boundary in the ionosphere or the
inner boundary of the magnetosphere simulation in the equatorial plane.
The choice of this boundary condition is usually justified by the
argument that it helps to shield the inner magnetosphere from the
cross‐tail electric field.

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-merkin2010}{Merkin \& Lyon, 2010}) tested three

\tightlist
\item
  STANDARD: Dirichlet, the potential at the low‐latitude boundary is set

  plasma to move normal to the boundary.
\item
  LOWERBC: Dirichlet, but the location of the low‐latitude boundary was
  moved to 2° above the equator, thus allowing the plasma to move across
  the magnetosphere inner boundary. (???)
  Equation~\ref{eq:ionosphere_potential2_spherical} is singular at

  Sparse linear algebra, GMRES together with an imcomplete LU

  Once the potential equation is solved the ionospheric potential is
  mapped back to the \(r_\text{in}\) shell and used as a boundary
  condition for the magnetospheric flow by taking
  \(\mathbf{v}=(-\nabla\Phi)\times\mathbf{B}/B^2\).

\hypertarget{caveats}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The mapping assumes conservation, which is not perfect. In practice
  \(r_\text{in}\sim 4\,\text{R}_\text{E}\) is a minimum requirement for
  reasonable FACs.
\item
  Most numerical codes couples a Cartesian grid to a spherical
  ionosphere grid, while some couples a spherical grid to a spherical
  grid. For magnetosphere simulations we need a relatively simple but
  super fast electric potential solver, therefore structured mesh is
  often adopted. If a spherical grid is used, care must be taken near
  the pole since it is a singular from the grid but not physics.
  Equation~\ref{eq:ionosphere_potential2} under spherical coordinates is
  written as
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ionosphere_potential2_spherical}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\sin\theta}&\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\Big[ \sin\theta\frac{\Sigma_P}{\cos^2\delta}\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\theta} - \frac{\Sigma_H}{\cos\delta}\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\phi} \Big] \\
+ &\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\Big[ \frac{\Sigma_P}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\phi}+\frac{\Sigma_H}{\sin\theta\cos\theta}\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\theta} \Big] = j_\parallel R^2\cos\delta
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:ionosphere_potential2_spherical}\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Be careful about distinguishing \(E_\parallel\) and \(j_\parallel\).
  \(E_\parallel = 0\) from advection and Hall terms, but
  \(j_\parallel=\nabla\times\mathbf{B}\cdot\hat{b}/\mu_0\) can be
  nonzero at the MHD inner boundary.
\item
  How important it is to use a more realistic conductance model?
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-merkin2010}{Merkin \& Lyon, 2010}) shows that
  different BCs may give \textgreater{} 10\% CPCP values, but I have no
  clue about the effect of a more complicated conductance.

\end{itemize}

For an ionosphere, a magnetic field-aligned grid is often used. This is
complicated by the non-orthogonal nature of the magnetic field
coordinate system. Assumptions are made.

How to solve each direction (coupled or independently)? For the
ionosphere, along the field-line is treated differently than across the
field-lines.

As the equations of motion are solved for, the source terms must be
added. How to treat these with respect to solving in the different
directions?

Build a simple 1D ionosphere model is easy (CAN I MAKE ONE MYSELF?).

Steady-state - assume \(\partial \mathbf{X}/\partial t = 0\). Strangly,
this is applied in situations in which the value can change on a time
scale much faster than the time-step. For example, the ion velocity is
often assumed to be steady-state. Ion chemistry is sometimes assumed to
be steady-state.

\hypertarget{chemistry}{%
\subsection{Chemistry}\label{chemistry}}

\[
\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} = S - L
\]

where \(N\) is the number density of the species, \(S\) represents the
sources and \(L\) represents the losses. Losses can almost always be
expressed as:

\[
L = RMN
\]

where \(R\) is the reaction rate, \(M\) is the density of the species it
is reacting with.

For a steady-state,

\[
\begin{aligned}
S - L &= 0 \\
N &= \frac{S}{RM}
\end{aligned}
\]

This is quite stable, but can be very wrong in regions of slowly
changing ion densities, such as in the F-region. This is perfect for the
E-region, though. It is quite easy to implement in a simple environment,
but can be much more complicated as non-linear terms are include
(recombination, in which \(M\) can depend on \(N\)).

An explicit time step chemistry is trivial to implement in almost all
situations, but it is also the least stable, since the loss terms can
become larger than the source terms and the density can quickly be
driven to negative values. Subcycling can help with this, but not
always.

An implicit time step chemistry is relatively stable and easier to
implement than steady-state. For example in GITM, there is a blend
between sub-cycling and a simplified implicit scheme that switches
depending on the size of the loss term compared to the density.

Now we need to also look at the source terms. The ionization rates can
be obtained from \(Q_\text{EUV}\) and substituting
\(\sigma_s^i \lambda\) instead of \(\sigma_s^a\lambda\) (not in
\(\tau\)). {[}Schunk and Nagy{]} Chapter 8 list a bunch of chemical
equations.

After that, we write down all the sources and losses, decide a
time-stepping scheme, and run the model. However, if we don't have any
ion advection, the F-region will just build and build!

atmosphere, charged particles will precipitate into the atmosphere and
lost due to collisions. There are still many mysteries both due to lack
of observations and theories. For example, the classical theory cannot

Before 1990s, waves in the radiation belts are known for transferring
energy from charged particles, which act as a loss process to the
particles. Richard Thorne, together with his collegues, proposed that
they could also the sources of energetic particles ({[}Horne \&
Thorne{]}, 1998, 2003, 2005a,b). If that is the case, \emph{the
wave-particle interactions must break the adiabatic invariants}.

The theory of wave-particle interaction starts with hot plasma kinetic
theory (Section~\ref{sec:HPDR}). When the denominator goes to 0, the
resonance condition is fulfilled. From observations, we learned that the
wave frequencies are smaller than the gyro-frequencies. How can we have
resonance then? The answer is, Doppler shift needs to be taken into
account.

\hypertarget{sources-of-waves}{%

resonance can generate current --\textgreater{} this current can
generate higher frequency radiations?

Whistler waves can be explained by the linear theory. However, chorus
and hiss waves are highly nonlinear and thus cannot be explained by a
linear theory. We conjecture that they are caused by natural plasma
instabilities, but we still have little idea what exactly these
instabilities are.

\section{Modeling}\label{modeling}}

3D Fokker-Planck diffusion model (e.g.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-glauert2014three}{Glauert et al., 2014})) has
been built to model the radiation belt electrons. In the Earth's
radiation belts, the evolution of the phase-averaged phase-space density
\(f(p,r,t)\) can be described by a diffusion equation (see also
Equation~\ref{eq:fokker_planck}):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fokker_planck_general}{}{
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \sum_{i,j}\frac{\partial}{\partial J_i}\left[ D_{ij}\frac{\partial f}{\partial J_j} \right]
}\label{eq:fokker_planck_general}\end{equation}

Here \(D_{ij}\) are diffusion coefficients and \(J_i\) are the action
integrals, \(J_1 = 2\pi m_e \mu/|q|\), \(J_2 = J\), and
\(J_3 = q|\phi|\), where \(\mu,J\), and \(\phi\) are the adiabatic
invariants of charged particle motion, \(m_e\) is the electron mass, and
\(q\) the charge. The adiabatic invariants are awkward variables to
visualize and relate to data so many authors transform to other
coordinates. One choice is to use pitch angle, energy, and
\(L^\ast=2\pi M/(|\phi| R_\text{E})\) (Equation~\ref{eq:Lstar}), where
\(M=8.22\times 10^{22}\, \text{A}\,\text{m}^2\) is the magnetic moment
of the Earth's dipole field and \(R_\text{E}\) is the Earth's radius, as
the three independent variables.

Assuming a dipole field, changing coordinates to equatorial pitch angle
\(\alpha\), kinetic energy \(E\), and \(L^\ast\), and neglecting some
cross derivatives, Equation~\ref{eq:fokker_planck} can be written as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fokker_planck_convenient}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} =& \frac{1}{g(\alpha)}\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha}\bigg\rvert_{E,L} g(\alpha)\left( D_{\alpha\alpha}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\alpha}\bigg\rvert_{E,L} + D_{\alpha E}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\bigg\rvert_{\alpha,L} \right) \\
&+ \frac{1}{A(E)}\frac{\partial}{\partial E}\bigg\rvert_{\alpha,L} A(E) \left( D_{EE}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\bigg\rvert_{\alpha,L} + D_{E\alpha}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \alpha}\bigg\rvert_{E,L} \right) \\
&+ L^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial L}\bigg\rvert_{\mu,J}\left( \frac{D_{LL}}{L^2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial L}\bigg\rvert_{\mu,J} \right)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:fokker_planck_convenient}\end{equation}

where

\[
\begin{aligned}
g(\alpha) = T(\alpha)\sin 2\alpha \\
A(E) = (E+E_0)(E(E+2E_0))^{1/2}
\end{aligned}
\]

and \(E_0\) is the electron rest mass energy. \(T(\alpha)\) is related
to the bounce period and in a dipole field can be approximated by

\[
T(\alpha) = \big(1.3802 - 0.3198(\sin\alpha + \sin^{1/2} \alpha) \big)
\]

\(D_{\alpha\alpha},\, D_{\alpha E}=D_{E\alpha},\, D_{EE}\), and
\(D_{LL}\) are the \emph{drift-} and \emph{bounce-averaged} pitch angle,
mixed pitch angle energy, energy and radial diffusion coefficients,
respectively. When we need to clarify the fact that they are drift and
bounce averaged, they will be explicitly written as
\(\left< D_{\alpha\alpha} \right>^d, \left< D_{\alpha E} \right>^d, \left< D_{EE} \right>^d\),
and \(\left< D_{LL} \right>^d\), respectively.

The bounce-averaged pitch angle and energy diffusion rates are defined
by

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left< D_{\alpha\alpha} \right> &\equiv \left< \frac{(\Delta\alpha)^2}{2\Delta t} \right> \\
\left< D_{\alpha E} \right> &\equiv \left< \frac{(\Delta\alpha \Delta E)^2}{2\Delta t} \right> \\
\left< D_{EE} \right> &\equiv \left< \frac{(\Delta E)^2}{2\Delta t} \right>
\end{aligned}
\]

with units of \(\text{s}^{-1}, \text{J}\text{s}^{-1}\), and
\(\text{J}^2\text{s}^{-1}\), respectively.

A loss term of the form \(f/\tau_L\) can be added to represent losses to
the atmosphere due to collisions. Here, \(\tau_L\), the loss timescale,
is equal to 1/4 of the bounce time in the loss cone and infinite
elsewhere. As a first-order approximation, we can neglect the cross
terms and simplify Equation~\ref{eq:fokker_planck_convenient} as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:fokker_planck_nocrossterm}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} =& \frac{1}{g(\alpha)}\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha}\bigg\rvert_{E,L} g(\alpha)\left( D_{\alpha\alpha}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\alpha}\bigg\rvert_{E,L}\right) \\
&+ \frac{1}{A(E)}\frac{\partial}{\partial E}\bigg\rvert_{\alpha,L} A(E) \left( D_{EE}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\bigg\rvert_{\alpha,L}\right) \\
&+ L^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial L}\bigg\rvert_{\mu,J}\left( \frac{D_{LL}}{L^2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial L}\bigg\rvert_{\mu,J} \right) \\
&- \frac{f}{\tau_L}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:fokker_planck_nocrossterm}\end{equation}

The first three terms on the right-hand side represent pitch angle,
energy, and radial diffusion, respectively. The final term accounts for
losses to the atmosphere. Pitch angle diffusion has contributions from
wave-particle interactions and Coulomb collisions with the atmosphere,
though the latter are only significant inside the loss cone. Energy
diffusion is due to wave-particle interactions and radial diffusion to
interactions with large-scale fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic and
electric fields. The diffusion coefficients are based on statistical
wave models derived from data. Depending on the choice of the diffusion
coefficients, the Fokker-Planck equation can be linear, quasi-linear, or
nonlinear.

Let us make our lives even simpler by considering only the radial
diffusion and loss term. The quasi-linear assumptions are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Broadband wave spectrum (with random phase), typically assumed as a
  Gaussian centered around a single dominant mode
\item
  Low amplitude fluctuations (no nonlinear interactions)
\item
  ``Resonance limit'' (linear growth rate of instabilities goes to 0)
\item
  ULF wave-particle interactions lumped into the diffusion coefficient
\end{itemize}

Even when quasi-linear theory works fine, there are multiple sources of
uncertainties in the radial diffusion coefficient:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Background magnetic field model
\item
  Bounce + drift average eliminates MLT dependence
\item
  Azimuthal wave structure (i.e.~power distribution over mode numbers)
\end{itemize}

Given the limited observation data, we want to estimate the unknown
parameters \(D_{LL}, \tau_L\). This is called an \emph{inverse problem}.
In 2000, Brautigam and Albert proposed a dependence of the radial
diffusion coefficent on \(K_p\) and L:

\[
D_{LL} \approx 10^{-0.506 K_p(t) - 9.325}L^10
\]

The standard statistical approach is to apply a Bayesian parameter
estimation, where we are looking for a distribution of parameters and
correcting results based on new observations. However, it is difficult
to apply in high dimensions, which typically requires the Markov-chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. For example, our assumption is that the
parameters can be written in the following forms:

\[
\begin{aligned}
D_{LL}(L, t) &= 10^(a K_p(t) + b)L^c \\
\tau_L(L, t) &= \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
(a_0 + a_1 L + a_2 L^2) / K_p(t) & \text{for } L\le L_{pp} \\ a_3 / K_p(t) & \text{for } L > L_{pp}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(L_{pp}\) is the plasmapause location, which can be estimated
with some approximations. We introduce a bunch of random variables, and
the posterior distributions of these variables after MCMC give us the
best fits.

A new trend is to \href{https://youtu.be/5C913ApaxUY}{use
physics-informed machine learning to learn the coefficients}. First we
may need to constrain the forms of the coefficients to avoid an
ill-posed inverse problem. Let the physical loss term be described by a
drift coefficient \(C\):

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = L^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial L}\bigg\rvert_{\mu,J}\left( \frac{D_{LL}}{L^2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial L}\bigg\rvert_{\mu,J} \right) - \frac{\partial Cf}{\partial L}
\]

The job of \emph{Physical-Informed Neural Network} (PINN) is to deduce
the optimal \(D_{LL}\) and \(C\) based on statistics by embedding the
expected form of the equation into the loss term in the neural network.
As this is statistics, we can build and test any kind of relations
between variables without physical interpretation, which has been
critizised a lot. For example, one may ask how you can let the phase
space distribution \(f\) depend only on \(t\) and \(L\)? The information
is incomplete from a physics point of view, but datawise it may just
``work'', in the sense that neural network is essentially a
\emph{universal high-dimensional function approximator}.

\subsection{Coupling physical processes at different time
scales}\label{coupling-physical-processes-at-different-time-scales}}

If we only look at low frequency regime, the high frequency
wave-particle interactions behave as a diffusion process to the plasma.
Thus the coupling idea is not to simulate everything on the same time
scale, but simulate the radiation belt effect by macroscopic diffusion
coefficients.

\hypertarget{sec:aurora}{%
\chapter{Aurora}\label{sec:aurora}}

The aurora is a visible and fascinating consequence of the complex
magnetospheric processes that are driven by the interaction between the
solar wind and the geomagnetic field. The aurora can appear as a diffuse
plae band crossing the sky from east to west, or as rapidly moving
bright and colorful curtains and rays covering a large fraction of the
sky. We will not attempt to describe all the various forms that auroras
may appear in, but only distinguish between \emph{diffuse} and
\emph{discrete} auroras. The particles that cause these two main types
are precipitated into the atmosphere by rather different physical
processes. Magnetospheric substorms and the mechanisms leading to the
formation of discrete auroras are still at the frontier of
magnetospheric research. This chapter is mostly based on Chapter 10 in
the lecture notes of Prof.~Kjell Rönnmark.

\hypertarget{auroral-light-emission}{%
\section{Auroral Light Emission}\label{auroral-light-emission}}

There are numerous ancient legends and beliefs about the aurora from
various parts of the world. Many of the mythological ideas, as well as
more scientific theories from the eighteenth century, explained the
aurora as sunlight reflected, refracted, or scattered by various divine
or natural processes. Observations reveal that it consists of discrete
spectral lines, which proves that auroral light is emitted by a gas, and
rules out reflected or scattered sunlight. The strongest line the
auroral spectrum is found to be \(557.7\,\mathrm{nm}\).

Auroras are caused by charged particles with energy in the range from 10
eV to 30 keV. These particles collide in the upper atomosphere with
atoms and molecules that are left in an excited state after the
collision. About 90\% of the aurora is caused by electrons, and the rest
by protons. At altitudes about 100 km where most of the auroral light is
emitted, the atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen as shown
in Fig. ???. In these gases the quantum mechanically allowed transitions
that produce strong spectral lins are all outside the visible part of
the spectrum --- otherwise air would not be transparent and colourless.
The visible auroral emissions are due to transitions from forbidden
metastable states, with low transition probabilities and long lifetimes.
If the gas pressure is too high, these metastable states will relax to
the ground state through collisions long before they decay by emitting
light. However, at altitudes above 100 km collisions are sufficiently
rare to allow the decay of an excited state of atomic oxygen. This state
has an excitation energy of 4.17 eV and a lifetime of 0.8 s. It decays
in a two step process. The green line is emitted in the first step,
which takes the atom to a state at 1.96 eV. This intermediate state has
a very long lifetime, 110 s, and the the red line emission at 630.0 nm
that takes it to the ground state mainly occurs at altitudes above 200
km. This red line can also be produced by direct excitation to the state
at 1.96 eV by collisions with low energy electrons. Other strong lines
in the auroral spectrum are emitted by nitrogen. Molecular
\(\mathrm{N}_2^+\) ions are created in an excited state by collisions,
and they decay to their ground state by emitting a bluish-voilet line at
427.8 nm. Sometimes the lowest part of strong auroras are colored red by
emissions near 600 nm from neutral \(\mathrm{N}_2\) molecules.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:aurora_altitude_dist}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{images/aurora_altitude_distribution.jpg}
\caption{The altitude distribution of auroral emissions at day and
night.}\label{fig:aurora_altitude_dist}
}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:aurora_altitude_dist} shows the typical altitude
distribution of the auroral emissions. The cross section for excitation
of the different lines depends on the energy of the incoming auroral
particles. Usually, the precipitating particles have higher energy at
night than during the day. Low energy electrons give up their energy at
higher altitudes, and produces more red emissions. Another difference
between day and night is that resonant scattering by sunlight enhances
the \(\mathrm{N}_2^+\) line 427.8 nm relative to the green line.

\hypertarget{diffuse-aurora}{%
\section{Diffuse Aurora}\label{diffuse-aurora}}

Some diffuse aurora is nearly always found in the auroral zone. On a
clear and dark night it is often seen as a diffuse band, which may
appear gray if the intensity is below the color threshold of the eye.
Even if no aurora can be seen from the ground, we know from satellite
observations of precipitating particles and auroral spectral lines in
the UV-range that the diffuse aurora forms a rather continuous band
aroud the auroral zone.

Magnetosheath particles that enter through the magnetopause cusps are a
source of diffuse aurora on the dayside. In the cusps there are field
lines that connect the ionosphere to the magnetosheath, and
magnetosheath particles with sufficiently small pitch angles will
precipitate along these field lines. Around local noon, there will be a
continuous flux of low energy (\(\le 100\,\mathrm{eV}\)) particles,
which at altitudes above 200 km cause a diffuse band of emissions at 630
nm.

On the nightside, and far into the evening and morning, diffuse auroras
are caused by particles of plasmasheet origin. The energy spectrum of
these particles extends from below 100 eV to above 20 keV. The
continuous precipitation of electrons from the plasmasheet presents a
problem, which has not been completely solved yet. Most of the
plasmasheet is on closed field lines, and the loss cone in a stationary
magnetosphere should be empty (because particles will be lost). To
explain the diffuse aurora, we need some mechanisms that can scatter the
particles into the loss cone.

Plasma waves in the equatorial magnetosphere can cause strong
pitch-angle scattering if they are resonant with the particles. Resonant
in this context means that the parallel velocity of the particle and the
phase velocity of the wave are related so that the particle feels an
electric field that oscillates at the gyrofrequency. Significant changes
in the velocities of the particles occur since they systematically gain
or lose energy while they are resonant. At least for electrons with
energy higher than a few keV, the required pitch-angle scattering can be
provided by a type of waves in the whistler mode, known as
\emph{magnetospheric hiss}. However, the phase velocity of whistler mode
waves may be too high to give resonance with lower energy electrons. Low
energy electrons can be scattered efficiently by waves in the upper
hybrid mode. Upper hybrid waves are electrostatic waves, but it is not
clear that these waves are sufficiently common to explain the diffuse
precipitation of low energy electrons.

\hypertarget{auroral-waves-and-ion-heating}{%
\section{Auroral Waves and Ion
Heating}\label{auroral-waves-and-ion-heating}}

Plasma waves play several roles on the auroral stage. As we have seen,
waves near the equator provide the pitch angle scattering that causes
diffuse aurora. Closer to Earth there are several types of plasma waves
that are generated by the intense flux of particles precipitating into
the aurora.

Discrete auroras are strong sources of whistler modes that appear rather
different from whistlers generated by lightning. The auroral emissions
are characterized by a broadband spectrum covering frequencies from a
few kHz to hundreds of kHz, and they are continously generated with only
slow amplitude variations. If the signal is amplified and connected to a
loudspeaker a hissing noise is heard, and these waves are called
\emph{auroral hiss}. The auroral hiss propagates from the upper
ionosphere to the equatorial magnetosphere where it contributes to the
magnetospheric hiss. Auroral hiss also propagates to the ground, and at
auroral latitudes it will cause noise in radio receivers tuned to low
frequencies.

An interesting wave emission connected to discrete auroral arcs is
called Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR). This is an intense radio wave
radiation with peak intensity at frequencies just below 300 kHz,
corresponding to a kilometric wavelength. However, the frequency can
vary from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. The AKR is generated by a mechanism involving
subtle relativistic effects ina low density plasma at a frequency very
close to the local electron gyrofrequency. The highest frequencies are
generated cloeet to Earth, where the magnetic field is strongest.The
maximum power transmitted as AKR has been estimated to 1 GW, which makes
auroras the strongest sources of radio waves from Earth. EM radiation at
these frequencies can propagate freely out of the magnetosphere where
the density is low, but it will be reflected from the ionosphere at the
level where the wave frequency equals \(\omega_{pe}\). Hence, AKR
signals cannot be received on the ground, and although these emissions
are very strong they were not discovered until 1965. In fact, the
corresponding auroral emission from Jupiter, which is known as Jovian
decametric radiation and has higher frequency, was observed by radio
astronomers ten years earlier.

Electrostatic plasma oscillations and other electrostatic waves are also
generated above auroral arcs. Electrostatic waves with low frequencies,
in the vicinity of the ion gyrofrequencies, have important effects on
the magnetospheric dynamics. These waves are generated by the auroral
electrons, but they are damped by the ions. The wave energy absorbed by
the ions goes mainly into their perpendicular velocities. The magnetic
moment then increases, and the ions are pushed out of the ionosphere by
the magnetic mirror force \(\mu\nabla B\). This process can cause a flow
of at least \(10^{25}\,O^+\) per second from the auroral ionosphere
during times of auroral activity. This flow gives the magnetosphere a
significant content of ionospheric particles, and reduces the plasma
density in the upper ionosphere above auroral arcs. In the auroral
cavity dug out by ion heating the electron density is often about
\(3\times10^5\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}\) down to altitudes below
\(1\,\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}\), at least when the ionosphere is in
darkness. This density reduction is essential for the generation of AKR,
and as we shall see also for the generation of discrete auroras.

\hypertarget{substorms-and-discrete-aurora}{%
\section{Substorms and Discrete
Aurora}\label{substorms-and-discrete-aurora}}

\emph{Magnetospheric substorms} arise due to an imbalance between the
dayside and nightside reconnection rates. As a simple example, this can
arise during a sudden rotation of the IMF from northward to southward. A
southward IMF leads to an increased reconnection rate at the
magnetopause. More plasma and more magnetic flux is then transported to
the magnetotail in \(\mathcal{O}(10^2)\,\mathrm{s}\), and the pressure
in the tail lobes increases. The plasmasheet is compressed, which on the
ground can be seen as an equatorward motion and brightening of a
pre-existing diffuse arc. The increased precipitation from the squeezed
plasmasheet will also intensify ion heating, which leads to lower
densities in the upper ionosphere above the auroral arc. As the density
of the cross tail current increases and the neutral sheet becomes
thinner, an unstable situation builds up. At this stage, reconnection
starts in some part of the tail (Figure~\ref{fig:substorm}). This marks
the onset of a magnetospheric substorm, and the process of storing
energy in the magnetotail described above is often called the
\emph{substorm growth phase}.

The original usage of ``substorm'' comes from Akasofu and Chapman
(1961), and was used to describe the short-term magnetic variations
during the main phase of a magnetic storm. The current definition did
not develop until a decade later, after it became clear that substorms
and storms were distinctly different geomagnetic phenomena. The
collection of phenomena that includes auroral breakup and expansion, the
substorm current wedge, near-Earth dipolarization, and Pi2 pulsations,
became collectively known as the magnetospheric substorm.

The concept of the \emph{substorm current wedge} (SCW) has played an
important role in understanding the coupling of the magnetotail to the
ionosphere during substorms. It provides a simple explanation for the
magnetic perturbations observed at mid and low latitudes during
substorms, and is useful in understanding the magnetic variations seen
in the auroral zone. In its simplest form, a model of the current wedge
consists of a single loop with line currents into and out of the
ionosphere on dipole field lines connected by a westward ionospheric
line current and by an eastward magnetospheric line current
(Figure~\ref{fig:substorm}).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:substorm}{%

magnetospheric substorm processes on the Earth's nightside. This

region, and reconfiguring magnetic fields in the substorm current wedge

}
\end{figure}

When the magnetic field lines in the tail start to reconnect, part of
the plasmasheet will be ejected from the tail and flow Earthward with a
speed that often exceeds 400 km/s. The braking of this flow at the inner
edge of the plasmasheet requires a substantial
\(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}\) force, and hence a substantial
dusk-to-dawn current, which leads to dipolarization of the inner portion
of the magnetic field. At the edges of the injection region, this
current is diverted into field-aligned currents that drive the auroral
electrojet, a strong westward current in the ionosphere. Note that the
auroral electrojet via Ohm's law implies a westward electric field and
an equatorward flow of the ionospheric plasma. Flows from the
reconnection region and dipolarization of the magnetic field are
associated with field-aligned currents coupling to the ionosphere, whose
net effect is then the SCW. This sequence of changes, from energy
storage through explosive release, is called a \emph{magnetospheric
substorm}. The reconnection process is temporally and spatially varying,
which structures the flows in scale sizes of the order of a few
\(\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}\) and time scales of a few minutes.

Field-aligned auroral currents in the ionosphere are observed to have
current densities of \(10\,\mathrm{\mu A}/\mathrm{m}^2\). Considering
only field-aligned currents, the current density must decrease higher up
where the flux tube widens. At altitudes around
\(1\,\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}\) the current density is still about
\(1\,\mathrm{\mu A}/\mathrm{m}^2\). In the auroral cavity where the
electron density \(n_e\) is about \(3\times10^5\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}\), we
can estimate the velocity the electrons must have to carry this current
as \(v_\parallel=j_\parallel/en_e \sim 2\times10^7\,\mathrm{m/s}\),
which corresponds to a kinetic energy slightly higher than 1 keV. When
the fast flow injected from the tail by reconnection is stopped, the
field-aligned current is carried by electrons that must be accelerated
to keV energies. These electrons will cause aurora, and the sudden
buildup of this current leads to a breakup of the quiet auroral arc that
existed during the growth phase of the substorm.

The auroral breakup occurs in the region of upward field-aligned
current, at the western end of the electrojet. The upward current is
carried by downgoing electrons that have been accelerated by
\(E_\parallel\) at altitudes around \(1\,\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}\). When
these electrons start to precipitate, a very bright and dynamic auroral
display begins. A suitably located observer may see a large part of the
sky filled with rapidly moving auroral forms. As illustrated in the
classical drawings of an auroral substorm shown by Akasofu 1968 (viewing
from the north pole), the aurora spreads poleward, and after a few
minutes more stable discrete auroral arcs start to form.

The inertia of the plasma flowing in from the tail with high speed will
carry it into a region where the ambient, mainly magnetic, pressure is
higher than the pressure in the injected plasma. As the inflow continues
the pressure increases, and the injected plasma will start to expand
towards the evening and morning side of the magnetosphere. This happens
somewhat further from Earth where the ambient magnetic pressure is
lower, on field lines that reach the ionosphere poleward of the initial
breakup. The azimuthal plasma flows associated with this expansion cause
the discrete arcs that form poleward of the breakup.

The simple substorm current wedge model described here is only a crude
approximation to the currents that actually exist in space. It is
generally believed that the upward current is localized in the
premidnight sector while the downward current is more broadly
distributed along the auroral oval post-midnight.\footnote{Up/down
  direction is determined w.r.t. the ionosphere.} Upward currents are
carried by downward moving electrons, while the downward current is a
combination of upward flowing electrons and precipitating ions. The
actual currents probably do not flow on the same L-shells. It has also
been suggested that the current wedge includes currents closing in
meridian planes. In this more complex model there is a second current
wedge of opposite sense flowing on a lower L-shell with a different
current strength. The effect of this loop on the ground is to reduce the
apparent strength of the higher latitude current wedge.

The Dungey cycle is the source of the two-cell (DP-2) ionospheric
convection pattern. Intervals of steady magnetospheric convection, where
the dayside and nightside reconnection rates are roughly balanced,
approach the idealized state originally envisioned by Dungey (1961). Yet
reconnection is not a steady process, and even during intervals of SMC,
when the solar wind driver is relatively constant, plasmasheet
convection can be intermittent and bursty. Detailed examination of the
responses reveals that a pair of field-aligned currents in the form of a
current wedge forms during each of the phenomenological stages. Thus,
the SCW system is a key phenomenon across all magnetospheric dynamics
related to the Dungey cycle, present from weak to extreme activity
conditions, and is the link between magnetospheric dynamics and the
ionosphere.

\hypertarget{knight-relation}{%
\subsection{Knight relation}\label{knight-relation}}

By studying the adiabatic motion of electrons in a parallel electric
field, Knight {[}1973{]} derived a formula for the auroral
current-voltage (C-V) relation. Analyzing data from sounding rockets,
Lyons et al.~{[}1979{]} found that the energy flux of pre- cipitating
electrons was proportional to the square of the potential drop. Soon
after, it was noticed that for the parameters of interest in the upward
current region, Knight's relation could be approximated by {[}Fridman
and Lemaire, 1980{]}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:knight_relation}{}{
j_{z} \approx -K \Delta\phi
}\label{eq:knight_relation}\end{equation}

where \(j_z\) is the field-aligned current density below the potential
drop and \(\Delta\phi\) is the potential difference between the
ionosphere and the equatorial magnetosphere. The constant \(K\), known
as the Lyons-Evans-Lundin constant, is given by

\[
K=\frac{n_{G}e^2}{\sqrt{2\pi m T_G}}
\]

where \(N_G\) and \(T_G\) are the density and temperature of electrons
in the equatorial generator region. Notice that since \(N_G\) and
\(T_G\) may vary in space and time, the term ``constant'' in this
context means ``independent of \(\phi\)''. The linear C-V relation
Equation~\ref{eq:knight_relation} has since been adopted as a part of
theoretical and numerical models. However, there are observations both
support and against this relation.

Using a fluid description of the plasma, Rönnmark {[}1999{]} showed that
within a purely electrostatic quasineutral model the potential drop
should be proportional to the square of the upward field-aligned current

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:phi_jpar_electrostatic}{}{
\Delta \phi = \frac{m_e}{2e^3}\frac{j_z^3}{n^2}
}\label{eq:phi_jpar_electrostatic}\end{equation}

where \(n\) is the density in the acceleration region above the
ionosphere.

\hypertarget{current-circuit}{%
\subsection{Current circuit}\label{current-circuit}}

The current circuit connected with a discrete auroral arc is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current}. Comparing with
Figure~\ref{fig:substorm} we see that the flows have been rotated from
radial to azimuthal. The length scales are also different, since the
auroral electrojet is hundreds of kilometers long and the ionospheric
current in Figure~\ref{fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current} which runs
across an auroral arc is at most a few km. Still the physics is very
similar. When pointing out some details, we will here use the geometry
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current}.

Let us assume that the auroral flux tube, extending from the ionosphere
to the equatorial plane, can be separated into three parts.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  At low altitudes we have the collision dominated ionosphere, where
  field-aligned currents are connected to horizontal currents.
\item
  The magnetospheric plasma above the ionosphere is collisionless. In a
  stationary state, and in the absence of collisions, the magnetic
  moment \(\mu\) and the total energy \(H\) are conserved along the
  phase-space trajectory of a particle. These assumptions imply that
  there are no currents perpendicular to the magnetic field lines (???),
  and the field-aligned current in a flux tube is conserved in the
  second, main, part of the flux tube.
\item
  The third part is the equatorial generator region. Perpendicular
  currents are in the generator region driven by kinetic and dynamic
  pressure gradients, and the divergence of these perpendicular currents
  is diverted to field-aligned currents. In the real magnetosphere the
  boundaries between these parts may be rather diffuse, and the
  generator region may extend far from the equatorial plane.
\end{enumerate}

For simplicity we assume that the main part of an auroral flux tube is
separated from the ionosphere and the generator region by well-defined
boundaries. Because of quasineutrality, the density of the light and
mobile electrons is determined by the ion density. The ion density will
remain approximately constant during transitions between different
stationary states. Such transitions, for example increases of the
field-aligned current, are accomplished by shear Alfvén waves
propagating up and down the field lines. The time variation of
\(E_\perp\) associated with these Alfvén waves will cause an \emph{ion
polarization current} \(j_\perp\) given by

\[
k_\perp = \frac{n_i m_i}{B^2}\frac{\partial E_\perp}{\partial t}
\]

Combining this with the ion continuity equation

\[
e\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial t} \approx -\partial_\perp j_\perp = \frac{n_i m_i}{B^2}\frac{\partial \partial_\perp E_\perp}{\partial t}
\]

we can integrate to find the density change \(\Delta n_i\) during the
growth of \(E_\perp\). Let \(L_\perp\) be the thickness of the current
sheet that \(j_\perp\) connects to. Choosing
\(E_\perp=0.1\,\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{m}\) and \(B=10\,\mu\mathrm{T}\) as
typical values for the auroral acceleration region we find

\[
\bigg\lvert \frac{\Delta n_i}{n_i} \bigg\rvert \sim \frac{m_i}{eB^2}|\partial_\perp E_\perp| \sim \frac{10\,\mathrm{m}}{L_\perp}
\]

Clearly, this process can increase the plasma density significantly only
within extremely thin current sheets. On the other hand, if the current
sheet has a thickness of a few hundred meters or more, the density will
remain almost constant. Hence, it seems reasonable to consider the
plasma density in the main part of the flux tube as fixed when the
current and voltage vary.

In a state of steady field-aligned current the contribution to the
current by ions of mass \(m_i\) is about a factor \(\sqrt{m_e/m_i}\)
smaller than the contribution by electrons of mass \(m_e\). If we as a
first approximation consider this ratio as fixed, the ion and electron
currents are separately conserved. In the main part of the flux tube,
where the current is purely field-aligned, the plasma density will then
be unaffected by the presence of a steady current. However, altitude
variations in plasma properties such as ion composition and electron and
ion temperatures may cause variations in the ratio between ion and
electron current, and this will cause slow decreases or increases of the
plasma density.

Pressure forces in the equatorial plane try to establish a strong
velocity shear \(\partial_x u_y\), which implies a strong
\(\partial_x E_x\) in Figure~\ref{fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current}
(\(\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}\)). Recalling
eq:ionosphere\_potential\_derivation we find that the gradient of the
ionospheric electric field is determined by the field-aligned current as

\[
\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x} = \frac{j_z}{\Sigma_P}
\]

As long as there is no potential drop along the field lines, the
magnetospheric and ionospheric electric fields are simply related, and
the mapping of a strong velocity shera in the equatorial plane to the
ionosphere demands a strong field-aligned current. However, a strong
current through the auroral cavity means that the electrons must be
accelerated by a potential drop (e.g.
Equation~\ref{eq:phi_jpar_electrostatic}).

The appearance of this potential drop on field lines that carry currents
up from the ionosphere means that the ionospheric and magnetospheric
electric fields become decoupled. The frozen-in condition does not hold
in the acceleration region, and this breakdown of ideal MHD also means
that the equatorial plasma is free to flow without dragging the
ionosphere along. The potential drop \(\Delta\phi\) limits the current
density, and hence the braking \(\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}\) force.
Notice that it is the low altitude acceleration in this potential drop,
which in the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons is observed
as a peak at the energy \(e\Delta\phi\), that distinguishes the discrete
from the diffuse aurora.

The field lines carrying current up from the ionosphere connect to
regions with a strong inward gradient of the driving force, which is the
outer part of the volume with enhanced pressure. When the brakes in this
region are released, the flow will build up a narrower region of high
pressure at larger \(y\). ??? Only the outer part of this smaller volume
will continue to expand, and this process quickly creates a narrow flow
channel in the \(y\)-direction. The outer edge of this channel maps to a
discrete auroral arc in the ionosphere.

In the model described above, the flows are constrained to the
\(y\)-direction. In the real magnetosphere, the flows can be deviated in
the radial \(x\)-direction to form curls and vortices. As illustrated by
Akasofu, the geometry of real auroral arcs is very complicated. The
patterns are similar to the turbulence seen when water flows from a
river into a lake.

I still have many questions regarding the substorms and SCW. Reading the
review by (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kepko2015substorm}{Kepko et al.,
2015}) makes things worse: my impression is that there has not yet
existed a model for explaining the whole current system. No wonder the
sawtooth study with MHD-EPIC ended up in a strange way.

\hypertarget{omega-band-auroras}{%
\section{Omega Band Auroras}\label{omega-band-auroras}}

Auroral luminosity undulations of the poleward boundaries of diffuse
auroras were first described by Akasofu and Kimball (1964) and were
named ``omega bands'' due to the similarity of their shapes to inverted
(poleward-opening) versions of the Greek letter Ω. Omega bands are
generally observed in the post-midnight and morning sectors during the
recovery phases of magnetospheric substorms. They typically have sizes
of 400--1000~km and usually drift eastward at speeds of 0.3--2~km/s.

\chapter{Boundary Conditions}\label{sec:BC}}

Boundary condition is an important topic both in theory and simulation.
This chapter aims at providing an overview of the boundary conditions we
apply for electromagnetism and plasma simulations.

\hypertarget{conducting-boundary}{%
\section{Conducting Boundary}\label{conducting-boundary}}

The general boundary conditions on the EM field at an interface between
medium 1 and medium 2 are

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:EM_BC_general}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\hat{n}\cdot (\mathbf{D}_1 - \mathbf{D}_2)= \tau \\
\hat{n}\times (\mathbf{E}_1-\mathbf{E}_2) =\mathbf{0} \\
\hat{n}\cdot(\mathbf{B}_1 - \mathbf{B}_2) =0 \\
\hat{n}\times (\mathbf{H}_1-\mathbf{H}_2) =\mathbf{ K}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:EM_BC_general}\end{equation}

where \(\tau\) is used for the interfacial surface change density (to
avoid confusion with the conductivity), and \(\mathbf{K}\) is the
surface current density. Here, \(\hat{n}\) is a unit vector normal to
the interface, directed from medium 2 to medium 1. We have learned from
EM that at normal incidence, the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave
falls off very rapidly with distance inside the surface of a good
conductor. In the limit of perfect conductivity (i.e.,
\(\sigma\rightarrow\infty\)), the wave does not penetrate into the
conductor at all, in which case the internal tangential electric and
magnetic fields vanish. This implies, from
Equation~\ref{eq:EM_BC_general}, that the tangential component of
\(\mathbf{E}\) vanishes just outside the surface of a good conductor,
whereas the tangential component of \(\mathbf{H}\) may remain finite.
Let us examine the behavior of the normal field components.

Let medium 1 be a conductor, of conductivity \(\sigma\) and dielectric
constant \(\epsilon_1\), for which
\(\sigma /\epsilon_1\,\epsilon_0\,\omega \gg 1\) , and let medium 2 be a
perfect insulator of dielectric constant \(\epsilon_2\). The change
density that forms at the interface between the two media is related to
the currents flowing inside the conductor. In fact, the conservation of
charge requires that

\[
\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{j} = \frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t} = -i\, \omega\,\tau
\]

However, \(\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{j} = \hat{n}\cdot\sigma \,\mathbf{E}_1\),
so it follows from Equation~\ref{eq:EM_BC_general} that

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{n}\cdot(\epsilon_0\epsilon_1\mathbf{E}_1 - \epsilon_0\epsilon_1\mathbf{E}_2) = \frac{i\sigma}{\omega}\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{E}_1 \\
\left(1+ \frac{i\,\omega\,\epsilon_0\,\epsilon_1}{\sigma}\right)\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{E}_1 = \frac{i\,\omega\, \epsilon_0\,\epsilon_2}{\sigma}\,\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{E}_2
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, it is clear that the normal component of \(\mathbf{E}\) within the
conductor also becomes vanishingly small as the conductivity approaches
infinity.

If \(\mathbf{E}\) vanishes inside a perfect conductor then the curl of
\(\mathbf{E}\) also vanishes, and the time rate of change of
\(\mathbf{B}\) is correspondingly zero. This implies that there are no
oscillatory fields whatever inside such a conductor, and that the fields
just outside satisfy

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{D}= -\tau \\
\hat{n}\times\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{0} \\
\hat{n}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0 \\
\hat{n}\times\mathbf{H}= -\mathbf{K}
\end{aligned}
\]

Here, \(\hat{n}\) is a unit normal at the surface of the conductor
pointing into the conductor. Thus, the electric field is normal, and the
magnetic field tangential, at the surface of a perfect conductor. For
good conductors, these boundary conditions yield excellent
representations of the geometrical configurations of the external
fields, but they lead to the neglect of some important features of real
fields, such as \emph{losses in cavities} and \emph{signal attenuation
in waveguides}.

\hypertarget{perfectly-matched-layer}{%
\section{Perfectly Matched Layer}\label{perfectly-matched-layer}}

In EM field solvers, often we need boundless free-space simulation to
prohibit reflecting waves. Back in 1993, a techinque called
\emph{perfectly matched layer} (PML) for the \emph{absorption} of EM
waves was proposed to handle this problem, so that we don't necessarily
need to set boundaries sufficiently far enough from the scatterer when
solving interaction problems. With the new medium the theoretical
reflection factor of a plane wave striking a vacuum-layer interface is
null at any frequency and at any incidence angle, contrary to the
previously designed medium with which such a factor is null at normal
incidence only. So, the layer surrounding the computational domain can
theoretically absorb without reflection any kind of wave travelling
towards boundaries, and it can be regarded as a perfectly matched layer.
The new medium as the PML medium and the new technique of free-space
simulation as the PML technique.

\hypertarget{derivation}{%
\subsection{Derivation}\label{derivation}}

The theoretical derivation starts in discussing the transverse electric
wave propagation. One key concept that confused me was the magnetic
conductivity denoted as \(\sigma^\ast\). Maybe this is just a jargon:
permeability is a magnetic analogy to conductivity in electric circuits.
Reluctance in a magnetic circuit is inversely proportional to
permeability just as electric resistance is inversely proportional to
conductivity. The relationships between length and cross-sectional area
are also the same. Consequently calling permeability ``magnetic
conductivity'' is a fine way to reinforce the analogy and understand
magnetic circuits using an electronic analogy.

I guess I need to review my EM courses to fully understand the
derivations.

\hypertarget{phase-space-sampling}{%
\section{Phase Space Sampling}\label{phase-space-sampling}}

Let \(\hat{f}(\mathbf{z})\) be a general probability density function
with normalization:

\[
\int_\Omega \hat{f}(\mathbf{z})dV = 1
\]

Now sample the phase space with \(N\) markers according to
\(\hat{f}(\mathbf{z})\) then the \emph{marker distribution}, \(g\) is:

\[
g(\mathbf{z}) = N\hat{f}(\mathbf{z})
\]

and the phase space volume element occupied by a marker is

\[
dV_i = \frac{1}{g(\mathbf{z}_i)}
\]

where \(\mathbf{z}_i\) is the phase space coordinate of the marker and
\(dV_i\) the volume element occupied by it.

Define the weight of a marker as the number of physical particles in the
corresponding phase space volume occupied by the marker:

\[
w_i = f(\mathbf{z}_i)dV_i = \frac{f(\mathbf{z}_i)}{g(\mathbf{z}_i)}
\]

This marker distribution can represent the total \(f\) or the
\(\delta f\). (???)

We can now take moments of the distribution function in the phase space
(such as density), and the Monte Carlo approximation to the integration
is as follows:

\[
M(A) = \int_\Omega A(\mathbf{z})f(\mathbf{z})dV = \sum_{i=1}^{N}A(\mathbf{z}_i)w_i + \mathcal{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}
\]

where \(N\) is the number of markers in the phase space region
\(\Omega\). This Monte Carlo approximation makes the particle simulation
feasible for a number of problems, even in 3D, at the cost of
introducing an error on the order of \(N^{-1/2}\).

\hypertarget{computational-cost}{%
\section{Computational Cost}\label{computational-cost}}

The key feature that makes PIC more feasible than the brute-force nbody
method is the reduction of computational cost. Given \(N\)
macro-particles in the system, a brute force method has a complexity of
\(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\), and a PIC method has \(\mathcal{O}(N\log N)\). A
rough idea how this is possible can be obtained by ignoring the pair
interactions and consider collective effects especially for those
particles at a large distance.

A commonly used trick is to introduce a reduced ion-to-electron mass
ratio. In a 3D simulation, the cost scales with \((m_i/m_e)^3\).
However, note that in low mass ratio runs (e.g.~\(m_i/m_e=25\)), the
thermal speed of the electrons may be comparable to the Alfvén speed
which causes higher wave decay through Landau damping on the electrons.

\hypertarget{sec:delta_f}{%
\section{δf Method}\label{sec:delta_f}}

Consider the growth rate of a single unstable wave in a 1D-1V
Vlasov-Poisson system of plasma. The energy conservation leads to

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dt}\Big(\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}E(x)^2\Big) + \int q v E(x)f(x,v)dv = 0
\]

For a single mode \(E(x,t) = A(t)\sin(kx-\omega t)\), the growth rate is

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\int qvEfdv = -\sum_j q_j w_j E(x_j)
\]

where \(w_j\) is the particle weight. All kinetic information lies in
the marker particle position distribution.

The idea of \(\delta-f\) method is to decompose the total distribution
function into two parts,

\[
f = f_0 + \delta f,\quad |\delta f|\ll f_0
\]

and let the particle weight be proportional to the perturbation part,

\[
w\propto \delta f,\quad w_j = \frac{\delta f(x_j, v_j)}{f(x_j, v_j)}
\]

If the contribution from \(f_0\) is known, for example

\[
\int qvE f_0 dv = \int qvf_0(v) A \sin(kx-\omega t)dv = 0
\]

then the growth rate can be written as

\[
\gamma = -\int qvE\delta f dv = -\int qvE\frac{\delta f}{f}f dv = \sum_j q_j v_j w_j E(x_j)
\]

Since now the particle weight is proportional to \(\delta f/f\), the
system noise would be significantly reduced by \((\delta f/f)^2\); in
other words, for the same noise level the number of macro-particles
required would be reduced by \((\delta f/f)^2\), which is typically
\(\mathcal{O}(10^6)\). Of course this requires the prior assumption
\(|\delta f| \ll f\) to be valid.

\hypertarget{sec:hybrid}{%
\chapter{Hybrid Methods}\label{sec:hybrid}}

The hybrid model is valid for low-frequency physics with
\(\omega\sim\Omega_i\) and \(kr_{Li}\sim 1\) (wavelength
\(\lambda\sim 6r_{Li}\)), where \(\omega\) is the wave frequency, \(k\)
is the wave number, \(\Omega_i\) is the ion gyrofrequency, and
\(r_{Li}\) is the ion Larmor radius. For this range of wave frequency
and wavelength, the ion kinetic physics in the near-Earth instabilities
are resolved with grid sizes \(\sim r_{Li}\) or ion inertial length
\(d_i\). The finite ion gyroradius effects are resolved with particle
time steps \(\Delta t\) much smaller than the gyroperiod.

A typical time step in a global hybrid magnetosphere model is
\(0.05\,\Omega_0^{-1}\), where \(\Omega_0\) is the upstream (solar wind)
ion gyrofrequency. For IMF \(B_0\sim10\,\text{nT}\),
\(\Omega_0 \sim 1\,\text{rad/s}\), which corresponds to
\(f_0\sim 1/2\pi\,\text{s}^{-1}\). Based on in-situ observations, the
typical ion inertial length in the tail is
\(\sim 0.2\,\text{R}_\text{E}\), but smaller near the dayside
magnetopause. Therefore usually discrete grid size
\(\Delta x = 0.1\,d_i\) is barely enough to resolve tail ion kinetic
dynamics but not dayside kinetic structures.

\hypertarget{classical-hybrid-model}{%
\section{Classical Hybrid Model}\label{classical-hybrid-model}}

Define the electric charge density \(\rho\) and current density
\(\mathbf{J}\) as

\[
\rho = \sum_s q_s n_s - en_e
\]

\[
\mathbf{J} = \sum_s q_s n_s \mathbf{V}_s - e n_e \mathbf{V}_e
\]

where \(q_s, n_s, \mathbf{V}_s\) are the charge, number density and bulk
velocity of ion species s calculated by taking moments of the
distribution function

\[
n_s = \int \mathrm{d}^3 v f_s(\mathbf{r}_s,\mathbf{v}_s,t)
\]

\[
\mathbf{u}_s = \frac{1}{n_s}\int \mathrm{d}^3 v \mathbf{v}_s f_s(\mathbf{r}_s,\mathbf{v}_s,t)
\]

or in the corresponding discrete forms where the distribution function
is represented as a group of macro-particles with a specific shape
function. In this way it behaves more like a particle cloud.

The crucial assumption in the hybrid model is the
\emph{quasi-neutrality}, that is, the electrons move fast enough to
cancel any charge-density fluctuations and \(\rho=0\) is always
satisfied. By assuming quasi-neutrality, we can

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  avoid solving the conservation equations for electrons
\item
  avoid solving the Maxwell's equations entirely and instead use the
  generalized Ohm's law instead
\end{itemize}

The electron density thus can be written by using ion densities
\(n_e \approx n_i \equiv \sum_s q_s n_s /e\). In addition, the electron
bulk velocity may also be eliminated using Ampère's law

\[
\mathbf{J} = \mu_0\nabla\times\mathbf{B}
\]

and the relation

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:hybrid_Je}{}{
\mathbf{v}_e = \mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{J}/n_e e
}\label{eq:hybrid_Je}\end{equation}

The basic equations used in the conventional PIC hybrid model first has
a particle pusher for individual ions

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}_j}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{v}_j
\]

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_j}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{q_j}{m_j}\big( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_j \times \mathbf{B} \big)
\]

where the subscript \(j\) and \(e\) indicate the indices for individual
ions and the electron fluid and other notations are standard. The
lowercase velocities are velocities for each macro-particle.

Alternatively, if we rely on a Vlasov system, we directly solve for the
distribution function \(f(\mathbf{r}_s, \mathbf{v}_s, t)\) from the
Vlasov equation

\[
\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}_s\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \mathbf{r}_s} + \mathbf{a}_s\cdot \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \mathbf{v}_s} = 0
\]

where

\[
\mathbf{a}_s = \frac{q_s}{m_s}(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}_s\times\mathbf{B})
\]

The generalized Ohm's law is used to determine the time evolution of the
electric field, derived from the electron momentum equation assuming
\(m_e \rightarrow 0\),

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:hybrid_ohm}{}{
\mathbf{E} = - \mathbf{V}_i \times \mathbf{B} + \frac{1}{n_i e}(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B} - \frac{1}{n_i e}\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}_e + \eta \mathbf{J}
}\label{eq:hybrid_ohm}\end{equation}

where the current in the Hall term has already been replaced by the
curvature of B. The last term can either represent collision/physical
resistivity, or artificial resistivity/numerical diffusion.

The magnetic fields evolve according to Faraday's law

\[
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\times\mathbf{E}
\]

Finally, by determining the electron pressure tensor by using an
appropriate equation of state, the evolution of the system can be
followed in time. For example, let
\(\overleftrightarrow{P}_e = P_e \overleftrightarrow{I}\) where \(P_e\)
is the isotropic scalar electron pressure. In the simplest form

\[
P_e = n_e k_B T_e
\]

where \(n_e \approx n_i\) and \(T_e=T_i\). Note however in a plasma
electron pressure is usually higher than ion temperature, so this is a
very crude assumption. Another commonly used assumption is an adiabatic
process

\[
P_e = n_e^\gamma k_B T_e = n_0(n/n_0)^\gamma k_B T_{e0}
\]

where \(\gamma=5/3\) is the adiabatic index for a monatomic ideal gas.

\hypertarget{sec:finite_e_mass}{%
\section{Finite Electron Inertia}\label{sec:finite_e_mass}}

The conventional hybrid simulation model dealing with kinetic ions and a
massless charge-neutralizing electron fluid is known to be susceptible
to numerical instability due to divergence of the whistler-mode wave
dispersion, as well as division-by-density operation in regions of low
density. The Alfvén wave at short wavelength comparable to ion inertia
length has dispersion due to the decoupling between ion and electron
dynamics. There thus appears the whistler mode whose frequency diverges
as \(\omega \propto k^2\). This means that the maximum phase velocity in
the system increases rapidly without bound, implying numerical
difficulty. The division-by-density issue originates from
Equation~\ref{eq:hybrid_Je} and appears in the Hall and electron
pressure gradient terms. Consequently, a pure vacuum region is not
allowed to exist in the simulation domain unless some ad hoc technique
is used.

The finite electron inertia correction is proposed to solve the
whistler-mode wave dispersion issue. The conventional way to include a
finite electron inertia correction into the hybrid model is to introduce
the following so-called generalized electromagnetic field
\(\widehat{\mathbf{E}}, \widehat{\mathbf{B}}\), defined as

\[
\widehat{\mathbf{E}} = \mathbf{E} - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big( \frac{c}{\omega_{pe}^2}\nabla\times\mathbf{B} \big)
\]

\[
\widehat{\mathbf{B}} = \mathbf{B} + \nabla\times\big( \frac{c^2}{\omega_{pe}^2}\nabla\times\mathbf{B} \big)
\]

in which the terms proportional to \(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}\) represent
electron inertia correction.

From the equation of motion for the electron fluid, it may be shown that

\[
\widehat{\mathbf{E}} = - \mathbf{V}_i \times \mathbf{B} + \frac{1}{n_i e}(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B} - \frac{1}{n_i e}\nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}_e - \frac{m_e}{e}(\mathbf{V}_e\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{V}_e
\]

which is similar to the generalized Ohm's law but now with the last term
which also represents the correction. \(\mathbf{V}_e\) is obtain from
Equation~\ref{eq:hybrid_Je}.

Given the generalized electric field \(\widehat{\mathbf{E}}\), one can
advance the generalized magnetic field \(\widehat{\mathbf{B}}\) by using
Faraday's law, which can be easily checked to satisfy

\[
\frac{\partial \widehat{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\times\widehat{\mathbf{E}}
\]

Further simplifications are commonly adopted; for example, the electric
field correction term and electron-scale spatial variation of density
are often ignored. In this case, the magnetic field may be recovered by
solving the equation

\[
\widehat{\mathbf{B}} = \big( 1 - \frac{c^2}{\omega_{pe}^2}\nabla^2 \big)\mathbf{B}
\]

and \(\widehat{\mathbf{E}} = \mathbf{E}\) is assumed. The nice feature
with this approach is that the correction can be implemented as a post
process to the each integration step of a standard procedure.

\hypertarget{low-density-treatment}{%
\section{Low Density Treatment}\label{low-density-treatment}}

Apparently new methods are still being proposed because the inclusion of
electron inertia term along cannot solve all the issues.
\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.06.048}{Amano+, 2014} suggests
another way to solve for the electric field

\[
(\omega_{pe}^2 - c^2\nabla^2)\mathbf{E} = \frac{e}{m_e}\big( \mathbf{J}_e \times\mathbf{B} - \nabla\cdot\overleftrightarrow{P}_e \big) + (\mathbf{V}_e\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{J}_e + \eta\mathbf{J}
\]

which can be reduced to the Laplace equation in near-vacuum region,
presenting no numerical difficulty.

Besides, the electron velocity is redefined

\[
\mathbf{V}_e = \frac{\mathbf{J}_e}{\text{max}(\rho_e, \rho_{e,min})}
\]

where the minimum density \(\rho_{e,min}\) is an artificially set value.

In a hybrid system, the maximum phase velocity is the electron Alfvén
speed, which goes to infinity when \(m_e \approx 0\). However, when
doing calculations we only have ion Alfvén speed

\[
v_{p,max} \simeq \frac{1}{2}\frac{B}{\sqrt{\mu_0 n_e m_e}} = \frac{1}{2}V_{A,i} \sqrt{\frac{m_i}{m_e}}
\]

To keep the maximum phase velocity always below the CFL condition, one
may use a modified electron mass ratio \(m_e^\prime\) defined as

\[
\frac{m_e^\prime}{m_i}=\text{max}\Big( \frac{m_e}{m_i}, V_A^2\big( \frac{\Delta t}{2\alpha \Delta x} \big)^2 \Big)
\]

instead of the physical electron mass \(m_e\). Here \(V_A\) is the
Alfvén speed calculated from the local density and magnetic field, and
\(\alpha\) is the maximum allowed Courant number (\(\le 0.5\)).

\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(n\mathbf{u}_i) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial mn\mathbf{u}_i}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\Big[ mn\mathbf{u}_i\mathbf{u}_i - \frac{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0} + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\mathbf{I} + \overleftrightarrow{P} \Big] = 0
\end{aligned}
\]

The difference between Hall MHD and hybrid model is the treatment of the
pressure tensor term. For Hall MHD with constant \(T_{i0}/T_{e0}\),

\[
\overleftrightarrow{P} = p_e(1 + T_{i0}/T_{e0})\mathbf{I}
\]

For hybrid models,

\[
\overleftrightarrow{P} = p_e\mathbf{I} + \int m_i f_i \mathbf{w}\mathbf{w}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}
\]

Thus Hall-MHD is a ``cold-ion'' model in the sense that it does not
include ion finite Larmor radius (FLR) or other kinetic effects from
warm distribution functions.

\hypertarget{normalization-1}{%
\section{Normalization}\label{normalization-1}}

We need three independent reference scales for normalized ion units in a
hybrid model. For instance, We can take a magnetic field scale \(B_0\),
density scale \(n_0\), and mass scale \(m_0\). The general variable
transformation from the original units to normalized units is

\[
\chi = \chi_0\tilde{\chi}
\]

where \(\tilde{\chi}\) denote the variable in the normalized units and
the scale \(\chi_0\) shall be in the original units (e.g.~SI).

Typically we use the inverse of gyrofrequency for the time scale

\[
T_0 = \Omega_{c0}^{-1} = \frac{m_0}{e B_0}
\]

and Alfvén speed for the velocity scale

\[
v_0 = v_A = \frac{B_0}{\sqrt{\mu_0 n_0 m_0}}
\]

Then the length scale is taken to be the ion skin-depth, or inertial
length

\[
L_0 = d_i = \frac{v_A}{\Omega_{ci}}
\]

A common trick we can use to speed up the simulation is to artificially
increase the ion mass such that the length scale is increased
\(\propto \sqrt{m_0}\). For example, in many global hybrid Earth
magnetosphere models, \(d_i\) in the upstream solar wind is artificially
increased to \(0.1\,\text{R}_E\) (by increasing the ion mass), which is
6.8 times the realistic \(d_i=0.015\,\text{R}_E\) for
\(n_{sw}=6\,\text{amu/cc}\). If our grid resolution is
\(0.05\,\text{R}_E\approx 300\,\text{km}\) (which is common as of
2020s), we will have about 10 points per ion-scale wave, which is enough
to resolve the ion-scale kinetics.

However, a consequence of this scaling due to computational limitation
must be emphasized. The reference Alfvén speed

\[
V_{A0} = d_{i0}\Omega_{i0}
\]

will also be larger than reality since we artificialy increase
\(d_{i0}\) but not \(\Omega_{i0}\).

Note the difference between gyrofrequency and frequency, which differs
by a factor of \(2\pi\):

\[
\omega = 2\pi f
\]

I once made a mistake in dealing with a code that uses SI units. You may
wonder how come the ion inertial length is defined by speed of light
divided by the plasma ion frequency in the unit of
\([\text{rad}/\text{s}]\), and time scale in the unit of
\(\Omega_i^{-1}\) which is \([\text{s}/\text{rad}]\). In practice, we do
not include \(2\pi\) in neither of them!

\hypertarget{numerical-stability}{%
\section{Numerical Stability}\label{numerical-stability}}

Nonlinear numerical simulations typically need some dissipation for
stability. This is achieved either via:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Explicit terms in equations (``physical dissipation'').
\item
  Upwinding of advective terms (implicit dissipation via discretization)
\end{enumerate}

Hybrid models usually follow 1) by adding dissipation in Ohm's law:

\[
\mathbf{E} = \underbrace{\mathbf{E}^\ast}_{\text{frictionless }\mathbf{E}} + \underbrace{\eta\mathbf{j}}_{\text{resistivity}} - \underbrace{\eta_H \nabla^2\mathbf{j}}_{\text{hyper-resistivity}}
\]

The reason that we need hyper-resistivity is because the Hall term is
badly behaved (stiff?). Slide 33 Stainer??? The hyper-resistivity term
has a similar form of an electron collisional viscosity
\(\eta_H\nabla^2\mathbf{u}_e\). But the coefficient is too large for
space, sometimes argued as ``anomalous viscosity''.

Extra care shall be taken for conservation when including the frictional
terms. For momentum conservation, we should use \(\mathbf{E}^\ast\) for
the macro-particle pusher or Vlasov solver, and only use \(\mathbf{E}\)
for updating \(\mathbf{B}\). For energy conservation, it requires a
separate electron pressure equation with frictional heating
\(H_e = \eta j^2 + \eta_H \nabla \mathbf{j}:\nabla\mathbf{j}\) and heat
flux \(\mathbf{q}_e\):

\[
(\gamma-1)^{-1}\Big[\frac{\partial p_e}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}_e p_e) \Big] + p_e\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}_e = H_e - \nabla\cdot\mathbf{q}_e
\]

\hypertarget{finite-grid-instability}{%
\subsection{Finite Grid Instability}\label{finite-grid-instability}}

Imagine a scenario where cold ion beams move through uniform spatial
mesh. It was shown by (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rambo1995finite}{Rambo,
1995}) that non-conservative (explicit) schemes are unstable for Ti /Te
\textless\textless{} 1 regardless of spatial resolution. The precise
threshold in \(T_i /T_e\) and beam velocity depends on shape-function
for macroparticles. This instability causes unstable (exponential)
heating of ions until some saturation value and also violates momentum
conservation. Implict momentum and energy conserving schemes are stable
w.r.t. these instabilities.

\hypertarget{magnetosphere-inner-boundary-conditions}{%
\section{Magnetosphere Inner Boundary
Conditions}\label{magnetosphere-inner-boundary-conditions}}

Inner boundary condition is often the most tricky part in magnetopshere
modeling. In Angeo3D {[}Lin+ 2014{]}, the inner magnetosphere
(\(r<6\,\text{R}_\text{E}\)) is assumed to be dominated by a cold,
incompressible ion fluid, which coexists with particle ions. The number
density of the cold ion fluid is assumed to be

\[
n_f = \frac{n_\text{eq}}{r^3}[1-\tanh(r-6.5)]
\]

where \(r\) is in the unit of \(\text{R}_\text{E}\), and
\(n_\text{eq}=1000\,\text{cm}^{-3}\).

The inclusion of the cold ion fluid in the inner magnetosphere
simplifies the conditions for the fluid-dominant low-altitude, inner
boundary. Ion particles are set to be reflected at the magnetospheric
inner boundary (e.g.~\(r=3.5\,\text{R}_\text{E}\)). This simple
reflection of the ion parallel velocity \(\mathbf{v}_{i\parallel}\)
means that loss cone effects are omitted. For a particle distribution
with an isotropic pitch angle distribution in a dipole field, the
particles in a full loss cone are only 0.3\% of the total, which is
reasonably neglected. \(\mathbf{B}\) is assumed to maintain the dipole
field values at the inner boundary. The ionospheric conditions (1000 km
altitude) are incorporated into the hybrid code, as in global MHD models
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-raeder1995}{Raeder et al., 1995}). See
Section~\ref{sec:MI_coupling}.

\hypertarget{proton-cyclotron-anisotropy-instability}{%
\subsection{Proton Cyclotron Anisotropy
Instability}\label{proton-cyclotron-anisotropy-instability}}

This is an electromagnetic and multi-ion verification test. We have an
1D-3V electromagnetic instability driven by
\(p_{i\perp}/p_{i\parallel} > 1\). Maximum growth happens at
\(\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{B}=0\) with a finite real frequency. For the
initial perturbation, we choose \(k_x \Delta x = 0.065\). We set an 1D
simulation with 64 cells and 10K particles/cell,
\(\Delta t \Omega_{ci} = 0.01\), dissipation=0.

PCAI results for nominal parameters:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Transverse velocity and magnetic field components grow from noise
  (left-handed Alfvén waves).
\item
  Agree with linear theory for these parameters
  (\(\gamma/\Omega_{ci} =0.162\)).
\item
  Pressure anisotropy decreases until saturation.
\end{itemize}

When we add a 20\% density fraction of a minor species of alpha
particles (\(\text{He}^+\)), the growth rate is modified.

\hypertarget{landau-damped-ion-acoustic-wave}{%
\subsection{Landau Damped Ion Acoustic
Wave}\label{landau-damped-ion-acoustic-wave}}

The fundamental electrostatic mode in the hybrid-PIC model is the ion
acoustic wave. This is also driven by pressure perturbations. In fluid
models (e.g.~Hall MHD), this wave is undamped. However, in the
hybrid-PIC, Landau resonance damps the wave and locally flattens ion
VDF, which is analogous to electron Landau damping of Langmuir
oscillations.

The dispersion relation is

\[
\frac{dZ(\zeta)}{\mathrm{d}\zeta} = 2\frac{T_i}{T_e},\quad \zeta\equiv \frac{\omega-i\gamma}{kv_{\text{th},i}}
\]

The nominal simulation parameters are:

\[
T_i = 1/3,\, \gamma=5/3,\, c_s = \sqrt{\gamma T_e/m_i} = 1,\, k_x = \pi/8,\, \delta n = 2\times 10^{-2}
\]

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item
    Use more particles/cell (noise \(\sim 1/\sqrt(N_p)\)).
  \item
    Binomial smoothing/higher order shape functions.
  \item

    \(\sim 1/N_p\)).
  \item

\hypertarget{magnetic-reconnection-island-coalescence}{%
\subsection{Magnetic Reconnection Island
Coalescence}\label{magnetic-reconnection-island-coalescence}}

Magnetic islands are 2D versions of flux-ropes. Here we set a
self-driven reconnection problem of coupling of ideal island motion to
micro-scale reconnection physics. Ion kinetic effects are crucial in
reconnection studies.

Unstable Fadeev island equilibrium: the magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\) is
given by \(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\), where in this setup we only need

\[
A_y = -\lambda B_0 \ln[\text{cosh}(z/\lambda) + \epsilon\cos(z/\lambda)]
\]

And the density is given by

\[
n = n_0(1-\epsilon^2)/[\text{cosh}(z/\lambda) + \epsilon\cos(z/\lambda)]^2 + n_b
\]

The pressure balance gives

\[
\beta = \frac{2\mu_0 n_0 k_B (T_{i0}+ T_{e0})}{B_0^2} = 1
\]

The nominal simulation parameters are:

\[
\lambda = 5d_i,\, \epsilon = 0.4,\, n_b = 0.2n_0,\, T_i/T_e = 1,\, \eta = 10^{-3},\, \eta_H = 5\times10^{-3},\, \gamma = 1
\]

and for the numerical parameters, we have a 2D space with
\(256\times128\) cells, 50 particles/cell,
\(\Delta t\Omega_{ci} = 0.005\).
