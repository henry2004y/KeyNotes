# Plasmas as Fluid {#sec:fluid}

## MHD

There are three basic assumptions in MHD:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon\omega/4\pi\sigma& \ll 1, \\
(v/c)^2&\ll 1,\\
\lambda/ L& \ll 1,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\omega$ is the plasma frequency, $v$ is the plasma bulk velocity, $\lambda$ is the average free distance, and $L$ is the system characteristic length.

Standard orderings of ideal MHD can also be written as

$$
\epsilon \sim \omega/\Omega_c \sim k\rho
$$

where the plasma varies on frequency scales $\omega$ small compared to the gyrofrequency $\Omega_c$, and varies on spatial scales $1/k$ long compared to the gyroradius $\rho$. (Here, $\epsilon$ means a "small" value.) Thus it covers phenomenon related to compressional and shear Alfv√©n waves and instabilities, ion acoustic waves, and ion and electron kinetic effects such as Landau damping. However, it does not include drift-waves or other micro-instabilities because they result from finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects which vanish in the usual MHD ordering. 

## Two-Fluid Model {#sec:2fluid}

Besides the Vlasov theory, we can apply the simpler but equally powerful 2-fluid model, in which electrons and ions are treated as two different fluids. The general procedure of obtaining the dispersion relation for electrostatic wave is:

1. Get the linear equations from governing equations.
2. Get the relation between linearized velocity and perturbed electric field.
3. Get the relation between linearized density and perturbed electric field.
4. Get the current response to the perturbed electric field.
5. Get the dielectric tensor from Maxwell's equation. Let $|\pmb{\epsilon}|=0$. we finally obtain the dispersion relation. For an isotropic case, the dielectric tensor shrinks to a scalar, so we simply have $\epsilon=0$.

Assume the simple equilibrium state in 1D (static and "cold" ions, "cold" electrons): $m_i=\infty,E_0=B_0=0, p_i=p_e=0, n_i = n_0, T_e=T_i=0$. Whenever we say "cold" for plasma, it does not mean that the plasma is at absolute zero degree. This only means that we are considering a situation where the kinetic pressure plays no roles in the dispersion relation. This is also a _non-magnetized plasma_ because $\mathbf{B_0} = 0$. The variables including perturbations are

$$
\begin{aligned}
n_e &= n_0+n_1 \quad n_0\gg n_1\\
v_e &= v_0+v_1 \quad v_0\gg v_1 \\
E &= \cancel{E}_0 +E_1 \\
n_1(x,t)&=\tilde{n}_1e^{-i\omega t+ikx}
\end{aligned}
$$

The electron continuity and the momentum equations read

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(n_0+n_1)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\big[(n_0+n_1)(v_0+v_1)\big]=0 \\
&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(v_0+v_1)+(v_0+v_1)\frac{\partial(v_0+v_1)}{\partial x}=-\frac{e}{m_e}\big[ (E_0+E_1)+(\mathbf{v}_0+\mathbf{v}_1)\times(\mathbf{B}_0+\mathbf{B}_1)_x \big]
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, for electrostatic waves, $\mathbf{B}_1=0$. Neglecting high order terms, we get the linearized equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(n_0 v_1)+\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(n_1v_0)&=0 \\
\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial t}+v_0\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}&=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1
\end{aligned}
$$

Assume wave-like perturbations $e^{ikx-i\omega t}$ as in the Vlasov theory, from the linearized momentum equation we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
(-i\omega+ikv_0)v_1&=-\frac{e}{m_e}E_1 \\
\Rightarrow v_1&=\frac{\frac{e}{m_e}E_1}{i(\omega-kv_0)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting into the linear continuity equation, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
-i\omega n_1+ikn_0v_1+ikn_1v_0=0 \\
\Rightarrow n_1=\frac{kn_0v_1}{\omega-kv_0}=\frac{kn_0}{\omega-kv_0}\frac{\frac{e}{m_e}E_1}{i(\omega-kv_0)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the density perturbation in response to electric perturbation $E_1$ in 2-fluid theory. 

Then we can use the Poisson's equation to generate the dielectric function

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}_1)+en_1\equiv\nabla\cdot(\epsilon \mathbf{E}_1)=0 \\
ik\epsilon_0 \tilde{E}_1+e\tilde{n}_1=ik\epsilon \tilde{E}_1 \\
\Rightarrow \epsilon=\epsilon_0 \Big[ 1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\omega-kv_0)^2} \Big]
\end{aligned}
$$

which is the same as the result given by Vlasov theory (Y.Y. Problem Set \#6.2). The advantage of using 2-fluid method is that we do not need to consider velocity space, which simplifies the derivation.

If we have two streams of electron described by $g(v)$ as

$$
\begin{aligned}
g(v)=\frac{1}{2}\big[ \delta(v-v_1)+\delta(v-v_2) \big]
\end{aligned}
$$

with the oscillation frequency $\omega_{p1},\omega_{p2}$ and number density $n_{p1,1},n_{p2,1}$ respectively. In consideration of linear superposition property, we expect the dielectric function to be

$$
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{p1}}^2}{(\omega-kv_1)^2}-\frac{{\omega_{p2}}^2}{(\omega-kv_2)^2}
$$

If $g(v)$ is a continuous distribution in general, $g(v)=\sum_j g_j(v)$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_j \frac{{\omega_{p,j}}^2 g_j(v)dv}{(\omega-kv)^2} \\ &=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{g(v)dv}{(v-\omega/k)^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\delta^\prime(x) = x^{-1}\delta(x)$. Here we reconstruct the result of Vlasov theory from 2-fluid theory. The equivalence of the two approaches is explored more thoroughly in later section Fluid Descriptions of Kinetic Modes (ADD LINK!).

Then what happens if ion motion is included? We still have "cold" ions at rest in equilibrium but now with ion perturbations in density. The Poisson's equation should include ion density perturbation

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E}_1)&=\sum_{j=i,e} q_j n_{1j} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}&=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv \frac{\partial g_e(v)/\partial v}{v-\omega/k}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{k^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dv \frac{\partial g_i(v)/\partial v}{v-\omega/k}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the simplest equilibrium case, $g_e(v)=\delta(v-v_0),\ g_i(v)=\delta(v)$

$$
\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\omega-kv_0)^2}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}
$$

Let $\epsilon=0$, we get the dispersion relation $\omega=\omega(k)$. An example dispersion relation and dielectric function property are shown in @fig:2stream_dispersion and @fig:2stream_dielectric, respectively. Note that if you have a real wave number $k$, you will get a pair of conjugate $\omega$, one of which that lies between $0$ and $kv_0$ is an unstable mode. This will exhibit 2-stream instability as shown by the velocity space distribution in @fig:2stream_velocity.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon(\omega,k)/\epsilon_0=1-\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\omega-kv_0)^2}-\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}=0 \notag \\
1=\frac{{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(\omega-kv_0)^2}+\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2}{\omega^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $\omega/\omega_{pe}=z,\ \frac{kv_0}{\omega_{pe}}=\lambda$, such that $z$ and $\lambda$ are dimensionless numbers. Let the right-hand side be $f(z)$, then

$$
f(z)=\frac{1}{(z-\lambda)^2}+\frac{{\omega_{pi}}^2/{\omega_{pe}}^2}{z^2}=\frac{z^2+(z-\lambda)^2 \omega_{pi}^2/{\omega_{pe}}^2}{(z-\lambda)^2z^2}
$$

We can plot $f$ to find the threshold of $k$ when the instability will happen. See Y.Y's Problem Set 6.3 for details.
