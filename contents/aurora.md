# Aurora {#sec:aurora}

The aurora is a visible and fascinating consequence of the complex magnetospheric processes that are driven by the interaction between the solar wind and the geomagnetic field. The aurora can appear as a diffuse plae band crossing the sky from east to west, or as rapidly moving bright and colorful curtains and rays covering a large fraction of the sky. We will not attempt to describe all the various forms that auroras may appear in, but only distinguish between _diffuse_ and _discrete_ auroras. The particles that cause these two main types are precipitated into the atmosphere by rather different physical processes. Magnetospheric substorms and the mechanisms leading to the formation of discrete auroras are still at the frontier of magnetospheric research. This chapter is mostly based on Chapter 10 in the lecture notes of Prof. Kjell Rönnmark.

## Auroral Light Emission

There are numerous ancient legends and beliefs about the aurora from various parts of the world. Many of the mythological ideas, as well as more scientific theories from the eighteenth century, explained the aurora as sunlight reflected, refracted, or scattered by various divine or natural processes. Observations reveal that it consists of discrete spectral lines, which proves that auroral light is emitted by a gas, and rules out reflected or scattered sunlight. The strongest line the auroral spectrum is found to be $557.7\,\mathrm{nm}$.

Auroras are caused by charged particles with energy in the range from 10 eV to 30 keV. These particles collide in the upper atomosphere with atoms and molecules that are left in an excited state after the collision. About 90% of the aurora is caused by electrons, and the rest by protons. At altitudes about 100 km where most of the auroral light is emitted, the atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen as shown in Fig. ???. In these gases the quantum mechanically allowed transitions that produce strong spectral lins are all outside the visible part of the spectrum --- otherwise air would not be transparent and colourless. The visible auroral emissions are due to transitions from forbidden metastable states, with low transition probabilities and long lifetimes. If the gas pressure is too high, these metastable states will relax to the ground state through collisions long before they decay by emitting light. However, at altitudes above 100 km collisions are sufficiently rare to allow the decay of an excited state of atomic oxygen. This state has an excitation energy of 4.17 eV and a lifetime of 0.8 s. It decays in a two step process. The green line is emitted in the first step, which takes the atom to a state at 1.96 eV. This intermediate state has a very long lifetime, 110 s, and the the red line emission at 630.0 nm that takes it to the ground state mainly occurs at altitudes above 200 km. This red line can also be produced by direct excitation to the state at 1.96 eV by collisions with low energy electrons. Other strong lines in the auroral spectrum are emitted by nitrogen. Molecular $\mathrm{N}_2^+$ ions are created in an excited state by collisions, and they decay to their ground state by emitting a bluish-voilet line at 427.8 nm. Sometimes the lowest part of strong auroras are colored red by emissions near 600 nm from neutral $\mathrm{N}_2$ molecules.

![The altitude distribution of auroral emissions at day and night.](images/aurora_altitude_distribution.jpg){#fig:aurora_altitude_dist}

@fig:aurora_altitude_dist shows the typical altitude distribution of the auroral emissions. The cross section for excitation of the different lines depends on the energy of the incoming auroral particles. Usually, the precipitating particles have higher energy at night than during the day. Low energy electrons give up their energy at higher altitudes, and produces more red emissions. Another difference between day and night is that resonant scattering by sunlight enhances the $\mathrm{N}_2^+$ line 427.8 nm relative to the green line.

## Diffuse Aurora

Some diffuse aurora is nearly always found in the auroral zone. On a clear and dark night it is often seen as a diffuse band, which may appear gray if the intensity is below the color threshold of the eye. Even if no aurora can be seen from the ground, we know from satellite observations of precipitating particles and auroral spectral lines in the UV-range that the diffuse aurora forms a rather continuous band aroud the auroral zone.

Magnetosheath particles that enter through the magnetopause cusps are a source of diffuse aurora on the dayside. In the cusps there are field lines that connect the ionosphere to the magnetosheath, and magnetosheath particles with sufficiently small pitch angles will precipitate along these field lines. Around local noon, there will be a continuous flux of low energy ($\le 100\,\mathrm{eV}$) particles, which at altitudes above 200 km cause a diffuse band of emissions at 630 nm.

On the nightside, and far into the evening and morning, diffuse auroras are caused by particles of plasma sheet origin. The energy spectrum of these particles extends from below 100 eV to above 20 keV. The continuous precipitation of electrons from the plasma sheet presents a problem, which has not been completely solved yet. Most of the plasma sheet is on closed field lines, and the loss cone in a stationary magnetosphere should be empty (because particles will be lost). To explain the diffuse aurora, we need some mechanisms that can scatter the particles into the loss cone.

Plasma waves in the equatorial magnetosphere can cause strong pitch-angle scattering if they are resonant with the particles. Resonant in this context means that the parallel velocity of the particle and the phase velocity of the wave are related so that the particle feels an electric field that oscillates at the gyrofrequency. Significant changes in the velocities of the particles occur since they systematically gain or lose energy while they are resonant. At least for electrons with energy higher than a few keV, the required pitch-angle scattering can be provided by a type of waves in the whistler mode, known as _magnetospheric hiss_. However, the phase velocity of whistler mode waves may be too high to give resonance with lower energy electrons. Low energy electrons can be scattered efficiently by waves in the upper hybrid mode. Upper hybrid waves are electrostatic waves, but it is not clear that these waves are sufficiently common to explain the diffuse precipitation of low energy electrons.

## Auroral Waves and Ion Heating

Plasma waves play several roles on the auroral stage. As we have seen, waves near the equator provide the pitch angle scattering that causes diffuse aurora. Closer to Earth there are several types of plasma waves that are generated by the intense flux of particles precipitating into the aurora.

Discrete auroras are strong sources of whistler modes that appear rather different from whistlers generated by lightning. The auroral emissions are characterized by a broadband spectrum covering frequencies from a few kHz to hundreds of kHz, and they are continously generated with only slow amplitude variations. If the signal is amplified and connected to a loudspeaker a hissing noise is heard, and these waves are called _auroral hiss_. The auroral hiss propagates from the upper ionosphere to the equatorial magnetosphere where it contributes to the magnetospheric hiss. Auroral hiss also propagates to the ground, and at auroral latitudes it will cause noise in radio receivers tuned to low frequencies.

An interesting wave emission connected to discrete auroral arcs is called Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR). This is an intense radio wave radiation with peak intensity at frequencies just below 300 kHz, corresponding to a kilometric wavelength. However, the frequency can vary from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. The AKR is generated by a mechanism involving subtle relativistic effects ina low density plasma at a frequency very close to the local electron gyrofrequency. The highest frequencies are generated cloeet to Earth, where the magnetic field is strongest.The maximum power transmitted as AKR has been estimated to 1 GW, which makes auroras the strongest sources of radio waves from Earth. EM radiation at these frequencies can propagate freely out of the magnetosphere where the density is low, but it will be reflected from the ionosphere at the level where the wave frequency equals $\omega_{pe}$. Hence, AKR signals cannot be received on the ground, and although these emissions are very strong they were not discovered until 1965. In fact, the corresponding auroral emission from Jupiter, which is known as Jovian decametric radiation and has higher frequency, was observed by radio astronomers ten years earlier.

Electrostatic plasma oscillations and other electrostatic waves are also generated above auroral arcs. Electrostatic waves with low frequencies, in the vicinity of the ion gyrofrequencies, have important effects on the magnetospheric dynamics. These waves are generated by the auroral electrons, but they are damped by the ions. The wave energy absorbed by the ions goes mainly into their perpendicular velocities. The magnetic moment then increases, and the ions are pushed out of the ionosphere by the magnetic mirror force $\mu\nabla B$. This process can cause a flow of at least $10^{25}\,O^+$ per second from the auroral ionosphere during times of auroral activity. This flow gives the magnetosphere a significant content of ionospheric particles, and reduces the plasma density in the upper ionosphere above auroral arcs. In the auroral cavity dug out by ion heating the electron density is often about $3\times10^5\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ down to altitudes below $1\,\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}$, at least when the ionosphere is in darkness. This density reduction is essential for the generation of AKR, and as we shall see also for the generation of discrete auroras.

## Substorms and Discrete Aurora

A southward IMF leads to an increased reconnection rate at the magnetopause. More plasma and more magnetic flux is then transported to the magnetotail, and the pressure in the tail lobes increases. The plasma sheet is compressed, which on the ground can be seen as an equatorward motion and brightening of a pre-existing diffuse arc. The increased precipitation from the squeezed plasma sheet will also intensify ion heating, which leads to lower densities in the upper ionosphere above the auroral arc. As the density of the cross tail current increases and the neutral sheet becomes thinner, an unstable situation builds up. At this stage, reconnection starts in some part of the tail (@fig:substorm). This marks the onset of a magnetospheric substorm, and the processes described above are often called the _growth phase_.

![A schematic view of the essential physical elements of magnetospheric substorm processes on the Earth’s nightside. This includes magnetotail current systems, the near-Earth neutral line region, and reconfiguring magnetic fields in the substorm current wedge as suggested by the near-Earth neutral line model.](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11214-021-00806-x/MediaObjects/11214_2021_806_Fig2_HTML.png){#fig:substorm}

When the magnetic field lines in the tail start to reconnect, part of the plasma sheet will be ejected from the tail and flow Earthward with a speed that often exceeds 400 km/s. The braking of this flow at the inner edge of the plasma sheet requires a substantial $\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}$ force, and hence a substantial dusk-to-dawn current. At the edges of the injection region, this current is diverted into field-aligned currents that drive the auroral electrojet, a strong westward current in the ionosphere. The geometry of this circuit is sketched in @fig:substorm. Note that the auroral electrojet via Ohm's law implies a westward electric field and an equatorward flow of the ionospheric plasma.

Field-aligned auroral currents in the ionosphere are observed to have current densities of $10\,\mathrm{\mu A}/\mathrm{m}^2$. Considering only field-aligned currents, the current density must decrease higher up where the flux tube widens. At altitudes around $1\,\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}$ the current density is still about $1\,\mathrm{\mu A}/\mathrm{m}^2$. In the auroral cavity where the electron density $n_e$ is about $3\times10^5\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, we can estimate the velocity the electrons must have to carry this current as $v_\parallel=j_\parallel/en_e \sim 2\times10^7\,\mathrm{m/s}$, which corresponds to a kinetic energy slightly higher than 1 keV. When the fast flow injected from the tail by reconnection is stopped, the field-aligned current is carried by electrons that must be accelerated to keV energies. These electrons will cause aurora, and the sudden buildup of this current leads to a breakup of the quiet auroral arc that existed during the growth phase of the substorm.

The auroral breakup occurs in the region of upward field-aligned current, at the western end of the electrojet. The upward current is carried by downgoing electrons that have been accelerated by $E_\parallel$ at altitudes around $1\,\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{E}$. When these electrons start to precipitate, a very bright and dynamic auroral display begins. A suitably located observer may see a large part of the sky filled with rapidly moving auroral forms. As illustrated in the classical drawings of an auroral substorm shown by Akasofu 1968 (viewing from the north pole), the aurora spreads poleward, and after a few minutes more stable discrete auroral arcs start to form.

The inertia of the plasma flowing in from the tail with high speed will carry it into a region where the ambient, mainly magnetic, pressure is higher than the pressure in the injected plasma. As the inflow continues the pressure increases, and the injected plasma will start to expand towards the evening and morning side of the magnetosphere. This happens somewhat further from Earth where the ambient magnetic pressure is lower, on field lines that reach the ionosphere poleward of the initial breakup. The azimuthal plasma flows associated with this expansion cause the discrete arcs that form poleward of the breakup.

The current circuit connected with a discrete auroral arc is shown in @fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current. Comparing with @fig:substorm we see that the flows have been rotated from radial to azimuthal. The length scales are also different, since the auroral electrojet is hundreds of kilometers long and the ionospheric current in @fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current which runs across an auroral arc is at most a few km. Still the physics is very similar. When pointing out some details, we will here use the geometry shown in @fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current.

![Geometry of the current circuit in a discrete auroral arc.](images/current_discrete_auroral_arc.jpg){#fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current}

Pressure forces in the equatorial plane try to establish a strong velocity shear $\partial_x u_y$, which implies a strong $\partial_x E_x$ in @fig:discrete_auroral_arc_current. ??? Recalling eq:ionosphere_potential_derivation we find that the gradient of the ionospheric electric field is determined by the field-aligned current as

$$
\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x} = \frac{j_z}{\Sigma_P}
$$

As long as there is no potential drop along the field lines, the magnetospheric and ionospheric electric fields are simply related, and the mapping of a strong velocity shera in the equatorial plane to the ionosphere demands a strong field-aligned current. However, a strong current through the auroral cavity means that the electrons must be accelerated by a potential drop ???

$$
\Delta \phi = \frac{m_e}{2e^3}\frac{j_z^3}{n^2}
$$

The appearance of this potential drop on field lines that carry currents up from the ionosphere means that the ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields become decoupled. The frozen-in condition does not hold in the acceleration region, and this breakdown of ideal MHD also means that the equatorial plasma is free to flow without dragging the ionosphere along. The potential drop $\Delta\phi$ limits the current density, and hence the braking $\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}$ force. Notice that it is the low altitude acceleration in this potential drop, which in the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons is observed as a peak at the energy $e\Delta\phi$, that distinguishes the discrete from the diffuse aurora.

The field lines carrying current up from the ionosphere connect to regions with a strong inward gradient of the driving force, which is the outer part of the volume with enhanced pressure. When the brakes in this region are released, the flow will build up a narrower region of high pressure at larger $y$. ??? Only the outer part of this smaller volume will continue to expand, and this process quickly creates a narrow flow channel in the $y$-direction. The outer edge of this channel maps to a discrete auroral arc in the ionosphere.

In the model described above, the flows are constrained to the $y$-direction. In the real magnetosphere, the flows can be deviated in the radial $x$-direction to form curls and vortices. As illustrated by Akasofu, the geometry of real auroral arcs is very complicated. The patterns are similar to the turbulence seen when water flows from a river into a lake.

I still have many questions regarding the substorms. Let me clarify them with an expert! Read [@kepko2015substorm] for more recent review!

## Omega Band Auroras

Auroral luminosity undulations of the poleward boundaries of diffuse auroras were first described by Akasofu and Kimball (1964) and were named “omega bands” due to the similarity of their shapes to inverted (poleward-opening) versions of the Greek letter Ω. Omega bands are generally observed in the post-midnight and morning sectors during the recovery phases of magnetospheric substorms. They typically have sizes of 400–1000 km and usually drift eastward at speeds of 0.3–2 km/s.
