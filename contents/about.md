These are my notes about plasma physics from multiple courses and textbooks, built via [Books.jl](https://books.huijzer.xyz) and is made possible by the Julia programming language [@bezanson2017julia] and [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).

Thanks to Prof. F. F. Chen, Y. Y. Lau, Yi Li, Yuming Wang, Richard Fitzpatrick, Paul Bellan, and Gábor Tóth through my journey of learning about plasmas. The backbone of the notes is [@chen2016introduction]. I also learned a lot from Richard Fitzpatrick's online [Plasma Physics Course Notes](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasmahtml). Y. Y. Lau's graduate course notes also have many references to [@bellan2008fundamentals].

The future is about nuclear fusion: what do you think?
