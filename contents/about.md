These are my notes about plasma physics from multiple courses and textbooks, built via [Books.jl](https://books.huijzer.xyz) and is made possible by the Julia programming language [@bezanson2017julia] and [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).

Thanks to Prof. F. F. Chen, Y. Y. Lau, Yi Li, Yuming Wang, and Gábor Tóth through my journey of learning about plasmas. The backbone of the notes is F. F. Chen's [Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-22309-4).

The future is about nuclear fusion: what do you think?
