<p>What makes plasmas particularly difficult to analyze is the fact that the densities fall in an intermediate range. Fluids like water are so dense that the motions of individual molecules do not have to be considered. Collisions dominate, and the simple equations of ordinary fluid dynamics suffice. At the other extreme in very low-density devices, only single-particle trajectories need to be considered; collective effects are often unimportant. Plasma behaves sometimes like fluids, and sometimes like a collection of individual particles. The first step in learning how to deal with this schizophrenic personality is to understand how single particles behave in electric and magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Single particle motion in neutral gases is trivial – particles move in straight lines until they hit other particles or the wall. Because of this simplicity, there is no point in keeping track of the details of single particle motion in a neutral gas and instead a statistical averaging of this motion suffices; this averaging shows that neutral gases have Maxwellian velocity distributions and are in a local thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, plasma particles are nearly collisionless and typically have complex trajectories that are strongly affected by both electric and magnetic fields.</p>
<p>As what will be shown in <a href="kinetic.html#sec-collision-entropy"><span>Section&nbsp;8.2.5</span></a>, the velocity distribution in a plasma will become Maxwellian when enough collisions have occurred to maximize the entropy. However, since collisions occur infrequently in hot plasmas, many important phenomena have time scales shorter than the time required for the plasma velocity distribution to become Maxwellian. A collisionless model is thus required to characterize these fast phenomena. In these situations randomization does not occur, entropy is conserved, the distribution function need not be Maxwellian, and the plasma is not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Thermodynamic concepts therefore do not apply, and the plasma is instead characterized by concepts from classical mechanics such as momentum or energy conservation of individual particles. In these collisionless situations the complex details of single particle dynamics are not washed out by collisions but instead persist and influence the macroscopic scale. As an example, the cyclotron resonance of a single particle can be important at the macroscopic scale in a collisionless plasma. This chapter examines various aspects of single particle motion and shows how these aspects can influence the macroscopic properties of a plasma.</p>
<p>Furthermore, study of single particle dynamics has a very direct relevance to Vlasov theory because, as shown in <a href="kinetic.html#sec-vlasov"><span>Section&nbsp;8.3.1</span></a>, any function constructed from constants of single particle motion is a valid solution of the collisionless Vlasov equation. Thus, knowledge of single particle dynamics provides a “repertoire” of constants of the motions from which solutions to the Vlasov equation suitable for various situations can be constructed.</p>
<p>Finally, the study of single particle motion develops valuable intuition regarding wave–particle interactions and identifies certain unusual situations, such as stochastic or non-adiabatic particle motion, that are beyond the descriptive capability of fluid models.</p>
<p>Here we assume that the EM fields are prescribed and not affected by the charged particles. The associated approach is often called <em>test particle</em>. Alternatively, we can say that it is possible to deduce intuitive and quite accurate analytic solutions for the drift of charged particles in arbitrarily complicated electric and magnetic fields provided the field are <em>slowly changing in both space and time</em>(this requirement is essentially the slowness requirement for adiabatic invariance introduced in <a href="#sec-adiabatic-invariant"><span>Section&nbsp;4.8</span></a>). Drift solutions are obtained by solving the Lorentz equation <span class="math display">\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = q\left( \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} \right)
\]</span> iteratively, taking advantage of the assumed separation of scales between fast and slow motions.</p>

<p>In this case, a charged particle has a simple cyclotron gyration. The equation of motion is <span class="math display">\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}
\]</span></p>
<p>Taking <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{z}\)</span> to be the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B} = B\widehat{z}\)</span>), we have <span class="math display">\[

<p>This describes a simple harmonic oscillator at the <em>cyclotron frequency</em>, which we define to be <span class="math display">\[
\omega_c \equiv \frac{| q | B}{m}
\]</span></p>
<p>By the convention we have chosen, <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span> is always nonnegative. The unit of <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span> in SI units is rad/s. To convert it to hertz, we need to divide it by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>. The solution of velocity is then <span class="math display">\[
v_{x,y} = v_\perp \exp(\pm i \omega_c t + i\delta_{x,y})
\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> denote the sign of q. We may choose the phase <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span> is a positive constant denoting the speed in the plane perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[
v_y  = \frac{m}{qB} \dot{v}_x = \pm \frac{1}{\omega_c}\dot{v}_x = \pm i v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} = \dot{y}

<p>We define the <em>Larmor radius</em> to be <span id="eq-larmor_radius"><span class="math display">\[

<p>Taking the real part of the positions, we have <span class="math display">\[

<p>This describes a circular orbit about a <em>guiding center</em> (<span class="math inline">\(x_0, y_0\)</span>) which is fixed. The direction of the gyration is always such that the magnetic field generated by the charged particle is opposite to the externally imposed field. Plasma particles, therefore, tend to <em>reduce</em> the magnetic field, and plasmas are <em>diamagnetic</em>. In addition to this motion, there is an arbitrary velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_z\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> which is not affected by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>.

<p>If now we allow an electric field to be present, the motion will be found to be the sum of two motions: the usual circular Larmor gyration plus a drift of the guiding center. The assumed spatial uniformity and time-independence of the fields represent the extreme limit of assuming that the fields are slowly changing in space and time. We may choose <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> to lie in the x-z plane so that <span class="math inline">\(E_y = 0\)</span>. As before, the z component of velocity is unrelated to the transverse components and can be treated separately. The equations of motion is now <span class="math display">\[
m\dot{\mathbf{v}} = q( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} )
\]</span> whose z component is <span class="math display">\[
\dot{v_z} = \frac{q}{m}E_z
\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[
v_z = \frac{qE_z}{m}t + v_{z0}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is a straightforward acceleration along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>. The transverse components are <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{v_x} &amp;= \frac{q}{m}E_x \pm \omega_c v_y \\
\dot{v_y} &amp;= 0 \mp \omega_c v_x
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Differentiating, we have (for constant <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>) <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &amp;= -\omega_c^2 v_x \\
\ddot{v}_y &amp;= \mp \omega_c \Big( \frac{q}{m}E_x \pm \omega_c v_y \Big) = -\omega_c^2 \Big( v_y + \frac{E_x}{B} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can write this as <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\Big( v_y + \frac{E_x}{B} \Big) = -\omega_c^2\Big( v_y + \frac{E_x}{B} \Big)
\]</span> so that it reduces to the previous case if we replace <span class="math inline">\(v_y\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(v_y + (E_x/B)\)</span>. The velocity solution is then replaced by <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
v_x &amp;= v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} \\
v_y &amp;= \pm v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} - \frac{E_x}{B}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The Larmor motion is the same as before, but there is superimposed a drift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{gc}\)</span> of the guiding center in the <span class="math inline">\(-y\)</span> direction (for <span class="math inline">\(E_x &gt; 0\)</span>).</p>
<p>To obtain a general formula for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{gc}\)</span>, we can solve the momentum equation in vector form. We may omit the <span class="math inline">\(m \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> term, since this term gives only the circular motion at <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span>, which we already know about. Then the momentum equation becomes <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the cross product with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{v}B^2 - \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{B})
\]</span></p>
<p>The transverse components with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> of this equation are <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}/B^2 \equiv \mathbf{v}_E
\]</span></p>
<p>We define this to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span>, the electric field drift of the guiding center. In magnitude, this drift is <span class="math display">\[
v_E = \frac{E(\text{V/m})}{B(\text{tesla})}\frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}}
\]</span></p>
<p>It is important to note that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span> is independent of q, m, and <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span>. The reason is obvious from the following physical picture. In the first half-cycle of the ion’s orbit, it gains energy from the electric field and increases in <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span> and, hence, in <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span>. In the second half-cycle, it loses energy and decreases in <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span>. This difference in <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span> on the left and right sides of the orbit causes the drift <span class="math inline">\(v_E\)</span>. A negative electron gyrates in the opposite direction but also gains energy in the opposite direction; it ends up drifting in the same direction as an ion. For particles of the same velocity but different mass, the lighter one will have smaller <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span> and hence drift less per cycle. However, its gyration frequency is also larger, and the two effects exactly cancel. Two particles of the same mass but different energy would have the same <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span>. The slower one will have smaller <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span> and hence gain less energy from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> in a half-cycle. However, for less energetic particles the fractional change in <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span> for a given change in energy is larger, and these two effects cancel. Another way of interpreting this behavior is to recall that according to the theory of special relativity the electric field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}^\prime\)</span> observed in a frame moving with velocity <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}^\prime = \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span> is simply a statement that a particle drifts in such a way to ensure that the electric field seen in its own frame vanishes.</p>
<p>The three-dimensional orbit in space for a charged particle with a nonzero initial velocity is therefore a slanted helix with changing pitch.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-gravity_field"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Gravitational Field</h3>
<p>The foregoing result can be applied to other forces by replacing <span class="math inline">\(q\mathbf{E}\)</span> in the equation of motion by a general force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span>. The guiding center drift caused by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span> is then <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_f = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>In particular, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span> is the force of gravity <span class="math inline">\(m\mathbf{g}\)</span>, there is a drift <span id="eq-gravity_drift"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_g = \frac{m}{q}\frac{\mathbf{g}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\tag{4.2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>This is similar to the drift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span> in that it is perpendicular to both the force and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, but it differs in one important respect. The drift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_g\)</span> changes sign with the particle’s charge. Under a gravitational force, ions and electrons drift in opposite directions, so there is a net current density in the plasma given by <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{j} = n(m_i+m_e)\frac{\mathbf{g}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The physical reason for this drift is again the change in Larmor radius as the particle gains and loses energy in the gravitational field. Now the electrons gyrate in the opposite sense to the ions, but the force on them is in the same direction, so the drift is in the opposite direction. The magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_g\)</span> is usually negligible, but when the lines of force (i.e.&nbsp;magnetic field lines) are curved, there is an effective gravitational force due to centrifugal force. This force, which is not negligible, is independent of mass; this is why we did not stress the m dependence of the drift here. Centrifugal force is the basis of a plasma instability called the “gravitational” instability, which has nothing to do with real gravity.</p>
<p>And now it shall be clear that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift analysis can be easily generalized to describe the effect on a charged particle of any force orthogonal to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> by simply making the replacement <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\rightarrow\mathbf{F}/q\)</span> in the Lorentz equation. Thus, any spatially uniform, temporally constant force orthogonal to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> will cause a drift <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_F = \frac{\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{B}}{qB^2}
\]</span> which leads to two counter-intuitive and important conclusions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A steady-state electric field perpendicular to a magnetic field does not drive currents in a plasma, but instead causes a bulk motion of the entire plasma across the magnetic field with the velocity <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A steady-state force (e.g., gravity, centrifugal force, etc.) perpendicular to the magnetic field causes oppositely directed motions for electrons and ions and so drives a cross-field current <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{j}_F = \sum_\sigma n_\sigma \frac{\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}

<p>Now that the concept of a guiding center drift is firmly established, we can discuss the motion of particles in inhomogeneous fields — <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> fields which vary in space or time. For uniform fields we were able to obtain exact expressions for the guiding center drifts. As soon as we introduce inhomogeneity, the problem becomes too complicated to solve exactly. To get an approximate answer, it is customary to expand in the small ratio <span class="math inline">\(r_L/L\)</span>, where L is the scale length of the inhomogeneity. This type of theory, called <em>orbit theory</em>, can become extremely involved. We shall examine only the simplest cases, where only one inhomogeneity occurs at a time.</p>

<p>Here the magnetic field lines are straight, but their density increases, say, in the y direction. We can anticipate the result by using our simple physical picture. The gradient in |B| causes the Larmor radius to be larger at the bottom of the orbit than at the top, and this should lead to a drift, in opposite directions for ions and electrons, perpendicular to both B and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span>. The drift velocity should obviously be proportional to <span class="math inline">\(r_L/L\)</span> and to <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the Lorentz force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>, averaged over a gyration. Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{F}_x = 0\)</span>, since the particle spends as much time moving up as down. We wish to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{F}_y\)</span>, in an approximate fashion, by using the <em>undisturbed orbit</em> of the particle to find the average. The undisturbed orbit is given by the solution in the first section for a uniform <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> field. Taking the real part of the solution for <span class="math inline">\(v_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
F_y = -q v_x B_z(y) = -q v_\perp(\cos \omega_c t) \Big[ B_0 \pm r_L(\cos\omega_c t )\frac{\partial B}{\partial y} \Big]
\]</span> where we have made a Taylor expansion of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> field about the point <span class="math inline">\(x_0=0, y_0=0\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{B} &amp;= \mathbf{B}_0 + (\mathbf{r}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B} + ... \\
Bz &amp;= B_0 + y(\partial B_z/\partial y) + ...
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>This expansion of course requires <span class="math inline">\(r_L / L \ll 1\)</span>, where L is the length scale of <span class="math inline">\(\partial Bz/\partial y\)</span>. The first term above averages to zero in a gyration, and the average of <span class="math inline">\(\cos^2 \omega_c t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, so that <span class="math display">\[
\bar{F}_y = \mp q v_\perp r_L \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial B}{\partial y}
\]</span></p>
<p>The guiding center drift velocity is then <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\bar{F}_y}{|B|}\widehat{x} = \mp \frac{v_\perp r_L}{B}\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial B}{\partial y} \widehat{x}
\]</span> where we have used the formula shown previously. Since the choice of the y axis was arbitrary, this can be generalized to <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \pm \frac{1}{2}v_\perp r_L \frac{\mathbf{B}\times \nabla B}{B^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>This has all the dependences we expected from the physical picture; only the factor <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> (arising from the averaging) was not predicted. Note that the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> stands for the sign of the charge, and lightface <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> stands for <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span>. The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B}\)</span> is called the <em>grad-B drift</em>; it is in opposite directions for ions and electrons and causes a current transverse to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>.

<h3 data-number="4.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curved-b-curvature-drift"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Curved B: Curvature Drift</h3>
<p>Here we assume the magnetic field lines to be curved with a constant radius of curvature <span class="math inline">\(R_c\)</span>, and we take <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> to be constant. Such a field does not obey Maxwell’s equations in a vacuum, so in practice the grad-B drift will always be added to the effect derived here. A guiding center drift arises from the centrifugal force felt by the particles as they move along the field lines in their thermal motion. If <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel^2\)</span> denotes the average square of the component of random velocity along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_c\)</span> denotes the radius of curvature vector from the center to the curve, the average centrifugal force is <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_{cf} = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{R_c}\widehat{r} = mv_\parallel^2\frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>According to the guiding center drift formula, this gives rise to a drift <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{R} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\mathbf{F}_{cf}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{qB^2}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The drift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_R\)</span> is called the <em>curvature drift</em>.</p>
<p>We must now compute the grad-B drift which accompanies this when the decrease of <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> with radius is taken into account. In a vacuum, we have <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = 0\)</span>. In the cylindrical coordinates, <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> only has a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> component, since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> has only a <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> component and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span> only an <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> component. We then have <span class="math display">\[
(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})_z = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(rB_\theta) = 0,\, B\propto \frac{1}{r}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="math display">\[
|B| \propto \frac{1}{R_c},\, \frac{\nabla B}{B} = - \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using the expression of the grad-B drift, we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \mp \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_\perp r_L}{B^2}\mathbf{B}\times\frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = \pm \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{q}v_\perp^2\frac{\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Adding this to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_R\)</span> , we have the total drift in a curved vacuum field: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_R + \mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \frac{m}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}\Big( v_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}v_\perp^2 \Big)
\]</span></p>
<p>It is unfortunate that these drifts add. This means that if one bends a magnetic field into a torus for the purpose of confining a thermonuclear plasma, the particles will drift out of the torus no matter how one juggles the temperatures and magnetic fields.</p>
<p>For a Maxwellian distribution, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_\parallel^2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\bar{v_\perp^2}\)</span> are each equal to <span class="math inline">\(k_B T/m\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span> involves two degrees of freedom. Then the average curved-field drift can be written as <span class="math display">\[
\bar{\mathbf{v}}_{R+\nabla B} = \pm \frac{v_{th}^2}{R_c\omega_c}\widehat{y} = \pm\frac{\bar{r}_L}{R_c}v_{th}\widehat{y}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{y}\)</span> here is the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{R}_c\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>.

<p>The variation of <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> with r causes a grad-B drift of guiding centers about the axis of symmetry, but there is no radial grad-B drift, because <span class="math inline">\(\partial B/\partial \theta = 0\)</span>. The components of the Lorentz force are <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
F_r &amp;= q(\underbrace{v_\theta B_z}_{\small{1}} - v_z \cancel{B_\theta}) \\
F_\theta &amp;= q(\underbrace{-v_r B_z}_{\small{2}} + \underbrace{v_z B_r}_{\small{3}}) \\
F_z &amp;= q(v_r \cancel{B}_\theta - \underbrace{v_\theta B_r}_{\small{4}})
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Two terms vanish if <span class="math inline">\(B_\theta = 0\)</span>, and terms 1 and 2 give rise to the usual Larmor gyration. Term 3 vanishes on the axis; when it does not vanish, this azimuthal force causes a drift in the radial direction. This drift merely makes the guiding centers follow the magnetic field lines. Term 4 is the one we are interested in. Using the expression of <span class="math inline">\(B_r\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
F_z = \frac{1}{2}q v_\theta r_L \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
\]</span></p>
<p>We must now average over one gyration. For simplicity, consider a particle whose guiding center lies on the axis. Then <span class="math inline">\(v_\theta\)</span> is a constant during a gyration; depending on the sign of q, <span class="math inline">\(v_\theta\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mp v_\perp\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(r = r_L\)</span> , the average force is <span class="math display">\[
\bar{F}_z = \mp \frac{1}{2}q v_\perp r_L \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z} = \mp \frac{1}{2}q\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c} \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{mv_\perp^2}{B} \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
\]</span></p>
<p>We define the <em>magnetic moment</em> of the gyrating particle to be <span class="math display">\[
\mu \equiv \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2 / B
\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[
\bar{F}_z = -\mu \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is a specific example of the force on a diamagnetic particle, which in general can be written <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_\parallel = -\mu\frac{\partial B}{\partial \mathbf{s}} = -\mu\nabla_\parallel B
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}\)</span> is a line element along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>. Note that the definition of magnetic moment here is the same as the usual definition for the magnetic moment of a current loop with area A and current I: <span class="math inline">\(\mu = IA\)</span>. In the case of a singly charged ion, I is generated by a charge e coming around <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c / 2\pi\)</span> times a second: <span class="math inline">\(I = e\omega_c/2\pi\)</span>. The area A is <span class="math inline">\(\pi r_L^2 = \pi r_L^2/\omega_c^2\)</span>. Thus <span class="math display">\[
\mu = \frac{e\omega_c}{2\pi}\frac{\pi r_L^2}{\omega_c^2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_\perp^2 e}{\omega_c} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{mv_\perp^2}{B}
\]</span></p>
<p>As the particle moves into regions of stronger or weaker B, its Larmor radius changes, but <em>μ remains invariant</em>. To prove this, consider the component of the equation of motion along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}v_\parallel}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\mu \frac{\partial B}{\partial s}
\]</span></p>
<p>Multiplying by <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> on the left and its equivalent <span class="math inline">\(ds/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> on the right, we have <span class="math display">\[
mv_\parallel \frac{\mathrm{d}v_\parallel}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 \Big) = -\mu\frac{\partial B}{\partial s}\frac{ds}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}B/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> is the variation of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as seen by the particle; <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> itself is constant. The particle’s energy must be conserved, so we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2 \Big) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \mu B \Big) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>With the previous equation this becomes <span class="math display">\[
-\mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\mu B) = 0
\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mu}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>The invariance of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the basis for one of the primary schemes for plasma confinement: the <em>magnetic mirror</em>. As a particle moves from a weak-field region to a strong-field region in the course of its thermal motion, it sees an increasing B, and therefore its <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span> must increase in order to keep μ constant. Since its total energy must remain constant, <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> must necessarily decrease. If B is high enough in the “throat” of the mirror, <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> eventually becomes zero; and the particle is “reflected” back to the weak-field region. It is, of course, the force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_\parallel\)</span> which causes the reflection. The nonuniform field of a simple pair of coil form two magnetic mirrors between which a plasma can be trapped. This effect works on both ions and electrons.</p>
<p>The trapping is not perfect, however. For instance, a particle with <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp = 0\)</span> will have no magnetic moment and will not feel any force along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>. A particle with small <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp / v_\parallel\)</span> at the midplane (<span class="math inline">\(B = B_0\)</span>) will also escape if the maximum field <span class="math inline">\(B_m\)</span> is not large enough. For given <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_m\)</span>, which particles will escape? A particle with <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp = v_{\perp 0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel = v_{\parallel 0}\)</span> at the midplane will have <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp = v_\perp^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel = 0\)</span> at its turning point. Let the field be <span class="math inline">\(B^\prime\)</span> there. Then the invariants of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> yields <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2}\frac{mv_{\perp 0}^2}{B_0} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m{v_{\perp 0}^{\prime}}^2}{B^\prime}
\]</span></p>
<p>Conservation of energy requires <span class="math display">\[
{v_{\perp 0}^{\prime}}^2 = v_{\perp 0}^2 + v_{\parallel 0}^2 \equiv v_0^2
\]</span></p>
<p>Combining the above two equations, we find <span class="math display">\[
\frac{B_0}{B^\prime} = \frac{v_{\perp 0}^2}{{v_{\perp}^{\prime}}^2} \equiv \sin^2 \theta
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the pitch angle of the orbit in the weak-field region. Particles with smaller θ will mirror in regions of higher B. If θ is too small, <span class="math inline">\(B^\prime\)</span> exceeds <span class="math inline">\(B_m\)</span>; and the particles does not mirror at all. Replacing <span class="math inline">\(B^\prime\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(B_m\)</span>, we see that the smallest <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of a confined particle is given by <span class="math display">\[
\sin^2 \theta_m = \frac{B_0}{B_m} \equiv \frac{1}{R_m}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R_m\)</span> is the <em>mirror ratio</em>. It defines the boundary of a region in velocity space in the shape of a cone, called a <em>loss cone</em>. Particles lying within the loss cone are not confined. Consequently, a mirror-confined plasma is never isotropic. Note that the loss cone is independent of q or m. Without collisions, both ions and electrons are equally well confined. When collisions occur, particles are lost when they change their pitch angle in a collision and are scattered into the loss cone. Generally, electrons are lost more easily because they have a higher collision frequency.</p>
<p>The magnetic mirror was first proposed by Enrico Fermi as a mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic rays. Protons bouncing between magnetic mirrors approaching each other at high velocity could gain energy at each bounce. How such mirrors could arise is another story. A further example of the mirror effect is the confinement of particles in the Van Allen belts. The magnetic field of the earth, being strong at the poles and weak at the equator, forms a natural mirror with rather large <span class="math inline">\(R_m\)</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-nonuniform_E"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Nonuniform E Field</h2>
<p>Now we let the magnetic field be uniform and the electric field be nonuniform. For simplicity, we assume <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> to be in the x direction and to vary sinusoidally in the x direction: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} \equiv E_0 (\cos kx)\widehat{x}
\]</span></p>
<p>This field distribution has a wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\pi / k\)</span>, and is the result of a sinusoidal distribution of charges, which we need not specify. In practice, such a charge distribution can arise in a plasma during a wave motion. The equation of motion is <span class="math display">\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = q[\mathbf{E}(x) + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}]
\]</span> whose transverse components are <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{v}_x &amp;= \frac{qB}{m}v_y + \frac{q}{m}E_x(x) \\
\dot{v}_y &amp;= -\frac{qB}{m}v_x
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &amp;= -\omega_c^2 v_x \pm \omega_c \frac{\dot{E}_x}{B} \\
\ddot{v}_y &amp;= -\omega_c^2 v_y -\omega_c^2\frac{E_x(x)}{B}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(E_x(x)\)</span> is the electric field at the position of the particle. To evaluate this, we need to know the particle’s orbit, which we are trying to solve for in the first place. If the electric field is weak, we may, as an approximation, use the <em>undisturbed orbit</em> to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(E_x(x)\)</span>. The orbit in the absence of the E field was given before <span class="math display">\[
x = x_0 + r_L\sin \omega_c t
\]</span> so we have <span class="math display">\[
\ddot{v}_y = -\omega_c^2 v_y -\omega_c^2\frac{E_0}{B}\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t)
\]</span></p>
<p>Anticipating the result, we look for a solution which is the sum of a gyration at <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span> and a steady drift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span>. Since we are interested in finding an expression for <span class="math inline">\(v_E\)</span>, we take out the gyratory motion by averaging over a cycle. The <span class="math inline">\(v_x\)</span> component then gives <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v}_x = 0\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In the <span class="math inline">\(v_y\)</span> component, the oscillating term <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{v}_y\)</span> clearly averages to zero, and we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\bar{\ddot{v}_y} = 0 = -\omega_c^2 \bar{v}_y -\omega_c^2\frac{E_0}{B}\bar{\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Expanding the cosine, we have <span class="math display">\[
\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t) = \cos(kx_0) \cos(kr_L \sin\omega_c t) - \sin(kx_0) \sin(kr_L \sin\omega_c t)
\]</span></p>
<p>It will suffice to treat the small Larmor radius case, <span class="math inline">\(kr_L \ll 1\)</span>. The Taylor expansions allow us to write <span class="math display">\[
\cos k (x_0 + r_L \sin\omega_c t) \approx \cos(kx_0)\big( 1 - \frac{1}{2}k^2r_L^2 \sin^2\omega_c t \big) - \sin(kx_0)k r_L \sin\omega_c t
\]</span></p>
<p>The last term vanishes upon averaging over time, and it gives <span class="math display">\[
\bar{v}_y = -\frac{E_0}{B}\cos(kx_0)\big( 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \big) = -\frac{E_x(x_0)}{B}\big( 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \big)
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the usual <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift is modified by the inhomogeneity to read <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_E = \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\big( 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2r_L^2 \big)
\]</span></p>
<p>The physical reason for this is easy to see. An ion with its guiding center at a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> actually spends a good deal of its time in regions of weaker <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>. Its average drift, therefore, is less than E/B evaluated at the guiding center. In a linearly varying <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> field, the ion would be in a stronger field on one side of the orbit and in a field weaker by the same amount on the other side; the correction to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span> then cancels out. From this it is clear that the correction term depends on the <em>second derivative</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>. For the sinusoidal distribution we assumed, the second derivative is always negative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>. For an arbitrary variation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>, we need only replace <span class="math inline">\(ik\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> and write the drift as <span id="eq-vE"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_E = \Big( 1 + \frac{1}{4}r_L^2\nabla^2 \Big) \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}
\tag{4.3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The second term is called the <em>finite-Larmor-radius effect</em>. What is the significance of this correction? Since <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span> is much larger for ions than for electrons, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span> is no longer independent of species. If a density clump occurs in a plasma, an electric field can cause the ions and electrons to separate, generating another electric field. If there is a feedback mechanism that causes the second electric field to enhance the first one, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> grows indefinitely, and the plasma is unstable. Such an instability, called a <em>drift instability</em>, is one type of plasma instabilities. The grad-B drift, of course, is also a finite-Larmor-radius effect and also causes charges to separate. However, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} \propto kr_L\)</span> whereas the correction term above is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(k^2 r_L^2\)</span>. The nonuniform-E-field effect, therefore, is important at relatively large k, or small scale lengths of the inhomogeneity. For this reason, drift instabilities belong to a more general class called <em>microinstabilities</em>.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-time-varying_E"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Time-Varying E Field</h2>
<p>Let us now take <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> to be uniform in space but varying in time. First, consider the case in which <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> alone varies sinusoidally in time, and let it lie along the x axis: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} = E_0 e^{i\omega t}\widehat{x}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\dot{E}_x = i\omega E_x\)</span>, we can write the velocity x-component equation as <span class="math display">\[
\ddot{v}_x = -\omega_c^2 \Big( v_x \mp \frac{i\omega}{\omega_c}\frac{\tilde{E}_x}{B} \Big)
\]</span></p>
<p>Let us define <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{v}_p &amp;\equiv \pm \frac{i\omega}{\omega_c}\frac{\tilde{E}_x}{B} \\
\tilde{v}_E &amp;\equiv \frac{\tilde{E}_x}{B}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where the tilde has been added merely to emphasize that the drift is oscillating. The plus (minus) sign, as usual, denotes positive (negative) <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Now the x and y velocity component equations can be written as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &amp;= -\omega_c^2(v_x - \tilde{v}_p) \\
\ddot{v}_y &amp;= -\omega_c^2(v_y - \tilde{v}_E)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>By analogy with the derivation in the case of a uniform EM field, we try a solution which is the sum of a drift and a gyratory motion: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
v_x &amp;= v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} + \tilde{v}_p \\
v_y &amp;= \pm i v_\perp e^{i\omega_c t} + \tilde{v}_E
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we now differentiate twice with respect to time, we find <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{v}_x &amp;= -\omega_c^2 v_x + (\omega_c^2 - \omega^2)\tilde{v}_p \\
\ddot{v}_y &amp;= -\omega_c^2 v_y + (\omega_c^2 - \omega^2)\tilde{v}_E
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> the same as the previous expressions right above unless <span class="math inline">\(\omega^2 \ll \omega_c^2\)</span>. If we now make the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> varies slowly, so that <span class="math inline">\(\omega^2 \ll \omega_c^2\)</span>, then there we have the approximate solution.</p>
<p>The solution of velocities in x and y tells us that the guiding center motion has two components. The y component, perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>, is the usual <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift, except that <span class="math inline">\(v_E\)</span> now oscillates slowly at the frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. The x component, a new drift <em>along the direction of</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>, is called the <em>polarization drift</em>. By replacing <span class="math inline">\(i\omega\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\partial/\partial t\)</span>, we can generalize the expression of <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> and define the polarization drift as <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_p = \pm \frac{1}{\omega_c B}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> is in opposite directions for ions and electrons, there is a <em>polarization current</em>; for Z = 1, this is <span id="eq-polarization_current"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{j}_p = ne(v_{ip} - v_{ep}) = \frac{ne}{eB^2}(M+m)\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\rho}{B^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{E}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\tag{4.4}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the mass density.</p>
<p>The physical reason for the polarization current is simple. Consider an ion at rest in a magnetic field. If a field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> is suddenly applied, the first thing the ion does is to move in the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>. Only after picking up a velocity <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> does the ion feel a Lorentz force <span class="math inline">\(e\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> and begin to move perpendicular to both fields. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> is now kept constant, there is no further <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> drift but only a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_E\)</span> drift. However, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> is reversed, there is again a momentary drift, this time to the left. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> is a startup drift due to inertia and occurs only in the first half-cycle of each gyration during which <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> changes. Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> goes to zero when <span class="math inline">\(\omega/\omega_c \ll 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The polarization effect in a plasma is similar to that in a solid dielectric, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}\)</span>. The dipoles in a plasma are ions and electrons separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(r_L\)</span>. But since ions and electrons can move around to preserve quasineutrality, the application of a steady <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> field does not result in a polarization field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}\)</span>. However, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> oscillates, an oscillating current <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{j}_p\)</span> results from the lag due to the ion inertia.</p>
<p>It is obvious that in this case the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift speed depends on time and the guiding center coordinate system is non-inertial. The polarization drift arises from the fictuous (inertial) force <span class="math inline">\(-m \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_E/\mathrm{d}t\)</span>. It means that the guiding center locations will not change due to the polarization drift!</p>
<p>Let us demonstrate this in a single configuration. Assume <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}=B\hat{z}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}=Et\hat{y}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> be the angle in the perpendicular plane: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_\perp = v_\perp\hat{e}_\perp = v_\perp(\cos\theta\hat{x}+\sin\theta\hat{y})
\]</span></p>
<p>The guiding center is defined as <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{r}_L = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{v}_\perp / \omega_c = \mathbf{x} - \frac{v_\perp}{\omega_c}\hat{\theta}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} = \mathbf{b}\times\hat{e}_\perp\)</span>. The equation of motion <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= q(\mathbf{E} +\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}) \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \mathbf{v}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> in the guiding center coordinates the two selected scalar equations can be written as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}v_x}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= qE_x + qv_yB \\
\frac{dX_y}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= v_y - \frac{1}{\omega_c}\frac{\mathrm{d}v_x}{\mathrm{d}t}

\frac{dX_y}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0

<p>Finally, we allow the magnetic field to vary in time. Since the Lorentz force is always perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span>, a magnetic field itself cannot impart energy to a charged particle. However, associated with the time-varying <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> is an electric field given by <span class="math display">\[
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\dot{\mathbf{B}}
\]</span> and this can accelerate the particles. We can no longer assume the fields to be completely uniform. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_\perp = \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> be the transverse velocity, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{l}\)</span> being the element of the path along a particle trajectory (with <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> neglected). Taking the scalar product of the equation of motion with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_\perp\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2 \Big) = q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{v}_\perp = q\mathbf{E}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]</span></p>
<p>The change in one gyration is obtained by integrating over one period: <span class="math display">\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \int_0^{2\pi/\omega_c}q\mathbf{E}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t

<p>If the field changes slowly, we can replace the time integral by a line integral over the unperturbed orbit: <span class="math display">\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \oint q\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} = q\int_s (\nabla\times\mathbf{E})\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = -q \int_s\dot{\mathbf{B}}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> is the surface enclosed by the Larmor orbit and has a direction given by the right-hand rule when the fingers point in the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span>. Since the plasma is diamagnetic, we have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}&lt;0\)</span> for ions and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}&gt;0\)</span> for electrons. Then <span class="math display">\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \pm q \dot{B}\pi r_L^2 = \pm q \pi\dot{B}\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c}\frac{m}{\pm qB} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2}{B}\cdot \frac{2\pi \dot{B}}{\omega_c}
\]</span></p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi\dot{B}}{\omega_c} = \frac{\dot{B}}{\omega_c}\)</span> is just the change <span class="math inline">\(\delta B\)</span> during one period of gyration. Thus <span class="math display">\[
\delta \Big( \frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2  \Big) = \mu \delta B
\]</span></p>
<p>Since the left-hand-side is <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\mu B)\)</span>, we have the desired result <span class="math display">\[
\delta \mu = 0
\]</span></p>
<p><em>The magnetic moment is invariant in slowly varying magnetic fields.</em></p>
<p>As the B field varies in strength, the Larmor orbits expand and contract, and the particles lose and gain transverse energy. This exchange of energy between the particles and the field is described very simply by the invariant of magnetic moment. The invariance of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> allows us to prove easily the following well-known theorem: <em>The magnetic flux through a Larmor orbit is constant</em>.</p>
<p>The flux <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(BS\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(S = \pi r_L^2\)</span>. Thus <span class="math display">\[
\Phi = B\pi\frac{v_\perp^2}{\omega_c^2} = B\pi\frac{v_\perp^2 m^2}{q^2 B^2} = \frac{2\pi m}{q^2}\frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_\perp^2}{B} = \frac{2\pi m}{q^2}\mu
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is constant if <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p>This property is used in a method of plasma heating known as <em>adiabatic compression</em>. A plasma is injected into a sequence of magnetic mirrors and by keep increasing the magnetic field in subsequent mirrors we can increase the plasma velocities.</p>

<p>Most of the drift motion we have considered before can be described under one framework. Consider in arbitrarily complicated but slowly changing fields subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The time variation is so slow that the fields can be considered as approximately constant during each cyclotron period of the motion.</li>
<li>The fields vary so <em>gradually</em> in space that they are nearly uniform over the spatial extent of any single complete cyclotron drift.</li>
<li>The electric and magnetic fields are related by Faraday’s law <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\dot{\mathbf{B}}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E/B\ll c\)</span> so that relativistic effects are unimportant (otherwise there would be a problem with <span class="math inline">\(v_E\)</span> becoming faster than <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In this more general situation a charged particle will gyrate about <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, stream parallel to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drifts across <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, and may also have force-based drifts. The analysis is based on the assumption that all these various motions are well-separated; this assumption is closely related to the requirement that the fields vary slowly and also to the concept of adiabatic invariant.</p>
<p>The assumed separation of scales is expressed by decomposing the particle motion into a fast, oscillatory component — the gyro-motion — and a slow component obtained by averaging out the gyromotion. As sketched in <a href="#fig-drift-decomposition">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a>, the particle’s position and velocity are each decomposed into two terms <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{gc}(t) + \mathbf{r}_L(t),\quad \mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{gc}(t) + \mathbf{v}_L(t)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_L(t), \mathbf{v}_L(t)\)</span> give the <em>fast</em> gyration of the particle in a cyclotron orbit and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_\mathrm{gc}(t), \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{gc}(t)\)</span> are the <em>slowly</em> changing motion of the <em>guiding center</em> obtained after averaging out the cyclotron motion. Ignoring any time dependence of the fields for now, the magnetic field seen by the particle can be written as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}(t)) &amp;= \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}_\mathrm{gc}(t)+\mathbf{r}_L(t)) \\
&amp;= \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}_\mathrm{gc}(t)) + (\mathbf{r}_L(t)\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> was assumed to be nearly uniform over the cyclotron orbit, it is sufficient to keep only the first term in the Taylor expansion of the magnetic field. The electric field may be expanded in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>After insertion of these Taylor expansions for the non-uniform electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz equation becomes <span class="math display">\[

\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The gyromotion (i.e.&nbsp;the fast cyclotron motion) is defined to be the solution of the equation <span class="math display">\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{L}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = q\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{L}(t)\times\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}_\mathrm{gc}(t))

<p>Substracting this fast motion equation from the prior one leaves <span id="eq-lorentz-avg"><span class="math display">\[

<p>Let us now average <a href="#eq-lorentz-avg">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.5</span></a> over one gyroperiod in which case terms <em>linear</em> in gyromotion average to zero. What remains is an equation describing the slow quantities, namely <span id="eq-lorentz-avg2"><span class="math display">\[

\tag{4.6}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(&lt;&gt;\)</span> means averaged over a cyclotron period. The guiding center velocity can now be decomposed into components perpendicular and parallel to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{gc}(t) = \mathbf{v}_{\perp gc}(t) + v_{\parallel gc}(t)\hat{b}

<p>Denoting the distance along the magnetic field by <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, the derivative of the magnetic field unit vector can be written, to lowest order, as (???) <span class="math display">\[

\tag{4.9}\]</span></span></p>
<p><a href="#eq-lorentz-perp2">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.8</span></a> is solved iteratively based on the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{gc}\)</span> has a slow time dependence. In the first iteration, the time dependence is neglected altogether so that the left-hand side of <a href="#eq-lorentz-perp2">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.8</span></a> is set to zero to obtain the “first guess” for the perpendicular drift to be <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{\perp gc}\simeq \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{F} \equiv \frac{\mathbf{F}_\perp\times\mathbf{B}}{qB^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Next, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> is defined to be a correction to this first guess, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> is assumed small and incorporates effects due to any time dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{\perp gc}\)</span>. To determine <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_p\)</span>, we write <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{\perp gc} = \mathbf{v}_F +\mathbf{v}_p\)</span> so, to second order <a href="#eq-lorentz-perp2">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.8</span></a> becomes <span id="eq-lorentz-perp3"><span class="math display">\[
m\frac{\mathrm{d}(\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{F}+\mathbf{v}_p)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_\perp + q(\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{F} + \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{p})\times\mathbf{B}
\tag{4.10}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In accordance with the slowness condition, it is assumed that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_p/\mathrm{d}t| \ll |\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{F}/\mathrm{d}t|\)</span> so <a href="#eq-lorentz-perp3">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.10</span></a> becomes <span class="math display">\[
0 = -m\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_F}{\mathrm{d}t} + q\mathbf{v}_p \times\mathbf{B}
\]</span></p>
<p>Crossing this equation with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> gives the general <em>polarization drift</em> <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_p = -\frac{m}{qB^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_F}{\mathrm{d}t}\times\mathbf{B}
\]</span></p>
<p>The most important example of the polarization drift is when <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_F\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift in a uniform, constant magnetic field so that (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\perp\mathbf{B}\)</span>?) <span class="math display">\[

\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>To calculate the middle term on the RHS of <a href="#eq-lorentz-perp3">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.10</span></a>, it is necessary to average over cyclotron orbits. This middle term is defined as the “grad B” force <span id="eq-grad-B-force"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_{\nabla B} = q\left&lt; \mathbf{v}_L(t)\times(\mathbf{r}_L(t)\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B} \right&gt;
\tag{4.11}\]</span></span></p>
<p>To simplify the algebra for the averaging, a local Cartesian coordinate system is used with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis in the direction of the gyrovelocity at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> axis in the direction of the magnetic field at the <em>gyrocenter</em>. Thus, the Larmor orbit velocity has the form <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_L(t) = v_{L0}\left[ \hat{x}\cos\omega_c t -\hat{y}\sin\omega_c t \right]
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\omega_c = \frac{qB}{m}
\]</span> is the cyclotron frequency we know before and the Larmor orbit position has the form <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r}_L(t) = \frac{v_{L0}}{\omega_c}\left[ \hat{x}\sin\omega_c t +\hat{y}\cos\omega_c t \right]
\]</span></p>
<p>Inserting the above two expressions in <a href="#eq-grad-B-force">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.11</span></a> gives <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_{\nabla B} = q\frac{v_{L0}^2}{\omega_c} \left&lt;\left[ \hat{x}\cos\omega_c t -\hat{y}\sin\omega_c t \right]\times(\left[ \hat{x}\sin\omega_c t +\hat{y}\cos\omega_c t \right]\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B} \right&gt;
\]</span></p>
<p>Noting that <span class="math inline">\(\left&lt; \sin^2\omega_c t \right&gt; = \left&lt; \cos^2\omega_c t \right&gt; = 1/2\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\left&lt; \sin\omega_c\cos\omega_c \right&gt; = 0\)</span>, this reduces to <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{F}_{\nabla B} &amp;= \frac{qv_{L0}^2}{2\omega_c}\left[ \hat{x}\times\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial y} - \hat{y}\times\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial x} \right] \\
&amp;= \frac{mv_{L0}^2}{2B}\left[ \hat{x}\times\frac{\partial(B_y\hat{y}+B_z\hat{z})}{\partial y} - \hat{y}\times\frac{\partial(B_x\hat{x}+B_z\hat{z})}{\partial x} \right] \\

\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>But from <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0\)</span>, it is seen that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial B_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial B_x}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}\)</span> so the “grad B” force is <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_{\nabla B} = -\frac{mv_{L0}^2}{2B}\nabla B
\]</span> where the approximation <span class="math inline">\(B_z\simeq B\)</span> has been used since the magnetic field direction is mainly in the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span> direction.</p>
<p>By applying the guiding center approximation, we reduce the number of independent variables from 6 <span class="math inline">\((x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z)\)</span> to 5 <span class="math inline">\((x,y,z,v_\perp, v_\parallel)\)</span>.</p>

<p>It is well known in classical mechanics that whenever a system has a periodic motion, the action integral <span class="math inline">\(\oint p dq\)</span> taken over a period is a constant of the motion. Here <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are the generalized momentum and coordinate which repeat themselves in the motion. If a slow change is made in the system, so that the motion is not quite periodic, the constant of the motion does not change and is then called an <em>adiabatic invariant</em>. By slow here we mean slow compared with the period of motion, so that the integral <span class="math inline">\(\oint p dq\)</span> is well defined even though it is strictly no longer an integral over a closed path. Adiabatic invariants play an important role in plasma physics; they allow us to obtain simple answers in many instances involving complicated motions. There are three adiabatic invariants, each corresponding to a different type of periodic motion.</p>

<p>Perfect symmetry is never attained in reality. This leads to the practical question of how constants of the motion behave when space and/or time symmetries are “good”, but not perfect. Does the utility of constants of the motion collapse abruptly when the slightest non-symmetrical blemish rears its ugly head, does the utility decay gracefully, or does something completely different happen? To answer these questions, we begin by considering the problem of a small-amplitude pendulum having a time-dependent, but slowly changing resonant frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega(t)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\omega^2=g/l\)</span>, the time-dependence of the frequency might result from either a slow change in the gravitational acceleration <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> or else from a slow change in the pendulum length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. In both cases the pendulum equation of motion will be <span id="eq-pendulum"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + \omega^2(t)x = 0

<p>This equation cannot be solved exactly for arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(\omega(t)\)</span> but if a modest restriction is put on <span class="math inline">\(\omega(t)\)</span> the equation can be solved <em>approximately</em> using the WKB method (Wentzel 1926, Kramers 1926, Brillouin 1926). This method is based on the hypothesis that the solution for a time-dependent frequency is likely to be a generalization of the constant-frequency solution <span class="math display">\[
x = \mathrm{Re}\left[ A\exp(i\omega t) \right]
\]</span> where this generalization is postulated to be of the form <span id="eq-pendulum-WKBJ-guess"><span class="math display">\[
x = \mathrm{Re}\left[ A(t) e^{i\int^t \omega(t^\prime)\mathrm{d}t^\prime} \right]
\tag{4.13}\]</span></span> Here <span class="math inline">\(A(t)\)</span> is an amplitude function determined as follows: calculate the first derivative we get <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathrm{Re}\left[ i\omega A e^{i\int^t \omega(t^\prime)\mathrm{d}t^\prime} + \frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}t} e^{i\int^t \omega(t^\prime)\mathrm{d}t^\prime} \right]
\]</span> then the second derivative <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = \mathrm{Re}\left[ \left( i\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t}A + 2i\omega\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}t} -\omega^2 A + \frac{\mathrm{d}^2A}{\mathrm{d}t^2} \right) e^{i\int^t \omega(t^\prime)\mathrm{d}t^\prime} \right]
\]</span> and insert this last result into <a href="#eq-pendulum">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.12</span></a> which reduces to <span id="eq-pendulum-WKBJ"><span class="math display">\[

To proceed further, we make an assumption — the validity of which is to be checked later — that the time dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}A/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> is <em>sufficiently</em> slow to allow dropping the last term in <a href="#eq-pendulum-WKBJ">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.14</span></a> relative to the middle term. The two terms that remain in <a href="#eq-pendulum-WKBJ">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.14</span></a> can then be rearranged as <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{\omega}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2}{A}\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]</span> which has the exact solution <span id="eq-WKBJ-A"><span class="math display">\[
A(t) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega(t)}}
\tag{4.15}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The assumption of slowness is thus at least self-consistent, for if <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is indeed slowly changing, <a href="#eq-WKBJ-A">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.15</span></a> shows that At will also be slowly changing and the dropping of the last term in <a href="#eq-pendulum-WKBJ">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.14</span></a> is justified. The slowness requirement can be quantified by assuming that the frequency has an exponential dependence <span class="math display">\[
\omega(t) = \omega_0 e^{\alpha t}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math display">\[
\alpha = \frac{1}{\omega}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]</span> is a measure of how fast the frequency is changing compared to the frequency itself. Hence, dropping the last term in <a href="#eq-pendulum-WKBJ">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.14</span></a> is legitimate if <span id="eq-pendulum-wkbj-criterion"><span class="math display">\[
\alpha = \frac{1}{\omega}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \ll 4\omega_0
\tag{4.16}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In other words, if <a href="#eq-pendulum-wkbj-criterion">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.16</span></a> is satisfied, then the fractional change of the pendulum period per period is small.</p>
<p><a href="#eq-WKBJ-A">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.15</span></a> indicates that when <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is time-dependent, the pendulum amplitude is not constant and so the pendulum energy is <em>not</em> conserved. It turns out that what is conserved is the <em>action integral</em> <span id="eq-pendulum-action-integral"><span class="math display">\[
S = \oint v\mathrm{d}x
\tag{4.17}\]</span></span> where the integration is over one period of oscillation. This integral can also be written in terms of time as <span class="math display">\[
S = \int_{t_0}^{t_0+\tau} v\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> is a time when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is at an instantaneous maximum and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the period of a complete cycle, is defined as the interval between two successive times when <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}t = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}^2/\mathrm{d}t^2\)</span> has the same sign (e.g., for a pendulum, <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> would be a time when the pendulum has swung all the way to the right and so is reversing its velocity while <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the time one has to wait for this to happen again). To show that action is conserved, <a href="#eq-pendulum-action-integral">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.17</span></a> can be integrated by parts as <span id="eq-pendulum-action-integral2"><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}

&amp;= \left[ x\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} \right]_{t_0}^{t_0+\tau} - \int_{t_0}^{t_0+\tau}x\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\mathrm{d}t \\
&amp;= \int_{t_0}^{t_0+\tau} \omega^2 x^2 \mathrm{d}t
\end{aligned}
\tag{4.18}\]</span></span> where the integrated term has vanished by virtue of the definitions of <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, and <a href="#eq-pendulum">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.12</span></a> has been used to substitute <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}^2 x/\mathrm{d}t^2\)</span>. <a href="#eq-pendulum-WKBJ-guess">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.13</span></a> and <a href="#eq-WKBJ-A">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.15</span></a> can be combined to give <span class="math display">\[

<p>The ratio in <a href="#eq-pendulum-action-integral-const">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.20</span></a> is the classical equivalent of the quantum number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of a simple harmonic oscillator because in quantum mechanics the energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of a simple harmonic oscillator is related to the frequency by the relation <span class="math inline">\(E/\hbar \omega = N+1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This analysis clearly applies to any dynamical system having an equation of motion of the form of <a href="#eq-pendulum">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.12</span></a>.

<p>Action has the dimensions of (canonical momentum) × (canonical coordinate) so we may anticipate that for general Hamiltonian systems, the action integral given in <a href="#eq-pendulum-action-integral">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.17</span></a> is not an invariant because <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is not, in general, proportional to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. We postulate that the general form for the action integral is <span id="eq-action-integral"><span class="math display">\[

<p>Let us define the radius vector in the <span class="math inline">\(Q-P\)</span> plane to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}=(Q,P)\)</span> and define unit vectors in the <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> directions by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}\)</span>; these definitions are shown in <a href="#fig-q-p-plane">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a>. Furthermore, we define the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> direction as being normal to the <span class="math inline">\(Q-P\)</span> plane; thus, the unit vector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}=\hat{Q}\times\hat{P}\)</span>. Hamilton’s equations (<span class="math inline">\(\dot{P} = -\partial H/\partial Q,\dot{Q}=\partial H/\partial P\)</span>) may be written in vector form as <span id="eq-hamilton-vector-form"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\hat{z}\times\nabla H
\tag{4.22}\]</span></span> where <span class="math display">\[
\nabla = \hat{Q}\frac{\partial}{\partial Q} + \hat{P}\frac{\partial}{\partial P}
\]</span> is the gradient operator in the <span class="math inline">\(Q-P\)</span> plane. <a href="#eq-hamilton-vector-form">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.22</span></a> shows that the phase-space “velocity” <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> is <em>orthogonal</em> ot <span class="math inline">\(\nabla H\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> <em>stays on a level contour of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span></em>. If <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a constant, then, in order for the motion to be periodic, the path along this level contour must circle around and join itself, like a road of constant elevation around the rim of a mountain (or a crater). If <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is not constant, but slowly changing in time, the contour will circle around and nearly join itself.</p>
<p><a href="#eq-hamilton-vector-form">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.22</span></a> can be inverted by crossing it with <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span> to give <span id="eq-hamilton-vector-form2"><span class="math display">\[

<p>For periodic and near-periodic motions, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> is always in the same sense (always clockwise or always counterclockwise). Thus, <a href="#eq-hamilton-vector-form2">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.23</span></a> shows that an observer following the path would always see that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is increasing on the left-hand side of the path and decreasing on the right-hand side (or vice versa). For clarity, the origin of the <span class="math inline">\(Q-P\)</span> plane is redefined to be at a local maximum or minimum of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Hence, near the extremum <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> must have the Taylor expansion <span class="math display">\[
H(P,Q) = H_\mathrm{extremum} + \frac{P^2}{2}\left[ \frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial P^2} \right]_{P=0,Q=0} + \frac{Q^2}{2}\left[ \frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial Q^2} \right]_{P=0,Q=0}
\]</span> where the second order derivatives are either both positive (valley) or both negative (hill). Since <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is assumed to have a slow dependence on time, these second derivatives will be time-dependent so that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> has the form <span id="eq-hamilton-extremum"><span class="math display">\[
H = \alpha(t)\frac{P^2}{2} + \beta(t)\frac{Q^2}{2}
\tag{4.24}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta(t)\)</span> have the same sign. The term <span class="math inline">\(H_\mathrm{extremum}\)</span> has been dropped because it is just an additive constant to the energy and does not affect Hamilton’s equations. From <a href="#eq-hamilton-vector-form">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.22</span></a> the direction of rotation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> is seen to be counterclockwise if the extremum of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a hill, and clockwise if a valley.</p>
<p>Hamilton’s equations operating on <a href="#eq-hamilton-extremum">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.24</span></a> give <span id="eq-hamilton-extremum2"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\beta Q,\quad \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}t} = \alpha P
\tag{4.25}\]</span></span></p>
<p>These equations do not directly generate the simple harmonic oscillator equation because of the time dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta\)</span>. However, if we define the auxiliary variable <span class="math display">\[
\tau = \int^t \beta(t^\prime)\mathrm{d}t^\prime
\]</span> then <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\tau}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = \beta\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}
\]</span> so <a href="#eq-hamilton-extremum2">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.25</span></a> becomes <span id="eq-hamilton-extremum3"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = -Q,\quad \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}P
\tag{4.26}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Substituting for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> in the right-hand equation using the left-hand equation gives <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2P}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} + \frac{\alpha}{\beta}P = 0
\]</span> which is a simple harmonic oscillator with <span class="math inline">\(\omega^2(\tau) = \alpha(\tau)/\beta(\tau)\)</span>. The action integral may be rewritten as <span class="math display">\[
S = \oint P\frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\mathrm{d}\tau
\]</span> where the integral is over one period of the motion. Using <a href="#eq-hamilton-extremum3">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.26</span></a> and following the same procedure as was used with <a href="#eq-pendulum-action-integral3">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.19</span></a>, this becomes <span class="math display">\[
S = \oint P^2\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\mathrm{d}\tau = \lambda^2\int \left[ \left( \frac{\alpha(\tau^\prime)}{\beta(\tau^\prime)} \right)^{1/2}\cos^2\left( \int^{\tau^\prime} (\alpha/\beta)^{1/2}\mathrm{d}\tau^{\prime\prime} \right) \right]\mathrm{d}\tau^\prime
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a constant dependent on initial conditions. By introducing the orbit phase <span class="math inline">\(\phi=\int^\tau (\alpha/\beta)^{1/2}\mathrm{d}\tau\)</span>, the above becomes <span class="math display">\[
S = \lambda^2 \int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\phi\cos^2\phi = \mathrm{const}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the general action integral is indeed an adiabatic invariant. This proof is of course only valid in the vicinity of an extremum of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, i.e., only where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> can be adequately represented by <a href="#eq-hamilton-extremum">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.24</span></a>.</p>

<p>We now develop a proof for the general adiabatic invariant. This proof is not restricted to small oscillations (i.e., being near an extremum of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>) as was the previous discussion. Let the Hamiltonian depend on time via a slowly changing parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(t)\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(H=H(P,Q,\lambda(t))\)</span>. From <a href="math.html#eq-hamiltonian-charged-particle">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.28</span></a> the energy is given by <span id="eq-hamilton-energy"><span class="math display">\[
E(t) = H(P,Q,\lambda(t))
\tag{4.27}\]</span></span> and, in principle, this relation can be inverted to give <span class="math inline">\(P=P(E(t),Q,\lambda(t))\)</span>. Suppose a particle is executing nearly periodic motion in the <span class="math inline">\(Q-P\)</span> plane. We define the turning point <span class="math inline">\(Q_{tp}\)</span> as a position where <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}Q/\mathrm{d}t=0\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is oscillating, there will be a turning point associated with <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> having its maximum value and a turning point associated with <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> having its minimum value. From now on let us only consider turning points where <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> has its maximum value, that is, we only consider the turning points on the right-hand side of the nearly periodic trajectories in the <span class="math inline">\(Q-P\)</span> plane shown in <a href="#fig-q-p-nearly-periodic-traj">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a>.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>If the motion is periodic, then the turning point for the <span class="math inline">\(N+1^{\mathrm{th}}\)</span> period will be the same as the turning point for the <span class="math inline">\(N^{\mathrm{th}}\)</span> period, but if the motion is only nearly periodic, there will be a slight difference as shown in <a href="#fig-q-p-nearly-periodic-traj">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a>. This difference can be characterized by making the turning point a function of time so <span class="math inline">\(Q_{tp}=Q_{tp}(t)\)</span>. This function is only defined for the times when <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}Q/\mathrm{d}t = 0\)</span>. When the motion is not exactly periodic, this turning point is such that <span class="math inline">\(Q_{tp}(t+\tau)\neq Q_{tp}(t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the time interval required for the particle to go from the first turning point to the next turning point. The action integral is over one entire period of oscillation starting from a right-hand turning point and then going to the next right-hand turning point and so can be written as <span class="math display">\[
S = \oint P\mathrm{d}Q = \int_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\tau)}P\mathrm{d}Q
\]</span></p>
<p>From <a href="math.html#eq-hamiltonian-charged-particle">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.28</span></a> it is seen that <span class="math inline">\(P/m\)</span> is not, in general, the velocity and so the velocity <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}Q/\mathrm{d}t\)</span> is not, in general, proportional to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (???). Thus, the turning points are not necessarily at the locations where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> vanishes, and in fact <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> need not change sign during a period. However, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> still corresponds to the area of phase-space enclosed by one period of the phase-space trajectory.</p>
<p>We can now calculate <span id="eq-action-integral-time-derivative"><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\int_{Q_{tp}(t)}^{Q_{tp}(t+\tau)}P(E(t),Q,\lambda(t))\mathrm{d}Q \\

<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}Q/\mathrm{d}t = 0\)</span> at the turning point, the integrated term vanishes and so there is no contribution from motion of the turning point. From <a href="#eq-hamilton-energy">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.27</span></a> we have <span class="math display">\[
1 = \frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial E} \right)_{Q,\lambda}

\tag{4.30}\]</span></span> since the first two terms canceled due to Hamilton’s equations. Substitution of <a href="#eq-hamilton-time-derivative">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.30</span></a> into <a href="#eq-action-integral-time-derivative2">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.29</span></a> gives <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}S/\mathrm{d}t=0\)</span>, completing the proof of adiabatic invariance. No assumption has been made here that <span class="math inline">\(P,Q\)</span> are close to the values associated with an extremum of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<p>This proof seems too neat, because it has established adiabatic invariance simply by careful use of the chain rule, and by taking partial derivatives. However, this observation reveals the underlying essence of adiabaticity, namely it is the differentiability of <span class="math inline">\(H, P\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> from one period to the next and the Hamilton nature of the system, which together provide the conditions for the adiabatic invariant to exist. If the motion had been such that after one cycle the motion had changed so drastically that taking a derivative of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with respect to would not make sense, then the adiabatic invariant would not exist.</p>

\oint p dq = \oint mv_\perp r \mathrm{d}\theta = 2\pi r_L m v_\perp = 2\pi \frac{mv_\perp^2}{\omega_c} = 4\pi \frac{m}{|q|}\mu
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is a constant of the motion as long as <span class="math inline">\(q/m\)</span> is not changed. We have proved the invariance of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> only with the implicit assumption <span class="math inline">\(\omega/\omega_c \ll 1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is a frequency characterizing the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> as seen by the particle. A proof exists, however, that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is invariant even when <span class="math inline">\(\omega/\omega_c \le q\)</span>. In theorists’ language, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is invariant “to all orders in an expansion in <span class="math inline">\(\omega/\omega_c\)</span>.” What this means in practice is that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> remains much more nearly constant than <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> does during one period of gyration.</p>
<p>It is just as important to know when an adiabatic invariant does <em>not</em> exist as to know when it does. Adiabatic invariance of μ is violated when ω is not small compared with <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span> . We give three examples of this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Magnetic Pumping</em>. If the strength of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> in a mirror confinement system is varied sinusoidally, the particles’ <span class="math inline">\(v_\perp\)</span> would oscillate; but there would be no gain of energy in the long run. However, if the particles make collisions, the invariance of μ is violated, and the plasma can be heated. In particular, a particle making a collision during the compression phase can transfer part of its gyration energy into <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> energy, and this is not taken out again in the expansion phase.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cyclotron Heating</em>. Now imagine that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> field is oscillated at the frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span>. The induced electric field will then rotate in phase with some of the particles and accelerate their Larmor motion continuously. The condition <span class="math inline">\(\omega\ll \omega_c\)</span> is violated, μ is not conserved, and the plasma can be heated.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Magnetic Cusps</em>. If the current in one of the coils in a simple magnetic mirror system is reversed, a magnetic cusp is formed. This configuration has, in addition to the usual mirrors, a spindle-cusp mirror extending over <span class="math inline">\(360^o\)</span> in azimuth. A plasma confined in a cusp device is supposed to have better stability properties than that in an ordinary mirror. Unfortunately, the loss-cone losses are larger because of the additional loss region; and the particle motion is nonadiabatic. Since the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> field vanishes at the center of symmetry, <span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span> is zero there; and μ is not preserved. The local Larmor radius near the center is larger than the device. Because of this, the adiabatic invariant μ does not guarantee that particles outside a loss cone will stay outside after passing through the nonadiabatic region. Fortunately, there is in this case another invariant: the canonical angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta = mrv_\theta - erA_\theta\)</span>. This ensures that there will be a population of particles trapped indefinitely until they make a collision.</p></li>

<p>Consider a particle trapped between two magnetic mirrors: it bounces between them and therefore has a periodic motion at the “bounce frequency”. A constant of this motion is given by <span class="math inline">\(\oint mv_\parallel ds\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(ds\)</span> is an element of path length (of the guiding center) along a field line. However, since the guiding center drifts across field lines, the motion is not exactly periodic, and the constant of the motion becomes an adiabatic invariant. This is called the <em>longitudinal invariant</em> <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and is defined for a half-cycle between the two turning points <span class="math display">\[
J = \int_a^b v_\parallel ds
\]</span></p>
<p>We shall prove that <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is invariant in a static, nonuniform B field; the result is also true for a slowly time-varying B field.</p>
<p>Before embarking on this somewhat lengthy proof, let us consider an example of the type of problem in which a theorem on the invariance of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> would be useful. As we have already seen, the earth’s magnetic field mirror-traps charged particles, which slowly drift in longitude around the earth. If the magnetic field were perfectly symmetric, the particle would eventually drift back to the same magnetic field line. However, the actual field is distorted by such effects as the solar wind. In that case, will a particle ever come back to the same magnetic field line? Since the particle’s energy is conserved and is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} mv_\perp^2\)</span> at the turning point, the invariance of μ indicates that <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> remains the same at the turning point. However, upon drifting back to the same longitude, a particle may find itself on another magnetic field line at a different altitude. This cannot happen if <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is conserved. <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> determines the length of the field lines between turning points, and no two lines have the same length between points with the same <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span>. Consequently, the particle returns to the same magnetic field line even in a slightly asymmetric field.</p>
<p>To prove the invariance of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>, we first consider the invariance of <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel \delta s\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\delta s\)</span> is a segment of the path along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>. Because of guiding center drifts, a particle on <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> will find itself on another magnetic field line <span class="math inline">\(\delta s^\prime\)</span> after a time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. The length of <span class="math inline">\(\delta s^\prime\)</span> is defined by passing planes perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> through the end points of <span class="math inline">\(\delta s\)</span>. The length of <span class="math inline">\(\delta s\)</span> is obviously proportional to the radius of curvature: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\delta s}{R_c} = \frac{\delta s^\prime}{R_c^\prime}
\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\delta s^\prime - \delta s}{\Delta t \delta s} = \frac{R_c^\prime - R_c}{\Delta t R_c}
\]</span></p>
<p>The “radial” component of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{gc}\)</span> is just <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc}\cdot \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c} = \frac{R_c^\prime - R_c}{\Delta t}
\]</span></p>
<p>The guiding center drift in curved vacuum field is <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \mathbf{v}_R + \mathbf{v}_{\nabla B} = \pm \frac{1}{2}v_\perp r_L\frac{\mathbf{B}\times\nabla B}{B^2} + \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The curvature drift has no component along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_c\)</span>. Using the above three equations, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{\delta s}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\delta s = \mathbf{v}_{gs} \cdot \frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{q}\frac{v_\perp^2}{B^3}(\mathbf{B}\times\nabla B)\cdot\frac{\mathbf{R}_c}{R_c^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(\delta s\)</span> as seen by the particle. We must now get the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> as seen by the particle. The parallel and perpendicular energies are defined by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W \equiv \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_\parallel^2 + \mu B \equiv W_\parallel + W_\perp
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> can be written <span class="math display">\[
v_\parallel = \left[ \frac{2}{m}(W - \mu B) \right]^{1/2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here W and μ are constant, and only B varies. Therefore, <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\dot{v}_\parallel}{v_\parallel} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mu\dot{B}}{W - \mu B} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mu \dot{B}}{W_\parallel} = -\frac{\mu\dot{B}}{mv_\parallel^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since B was assumed static, <span class="math inline">\(\dot{B}\)</span> is not zero only because of the guiding center motion: <span class="math display">\[
\dot{B} = \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{v}_{gc}\cdot\nabla B = \frac{mv_\parallel^2}{q}\frac{\mathbf{R}_c \times\mathbf{B}}{R_c^2 B^2} \cdot\nabla B
\]</span></p>
<p>Now we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\dot{v}_\parallel}{v_\parallel} = -\frac{\mu}{q}\frac{(\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B})\cdot\nabla B}{R_c^2 B^2} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{q}\frac{v_\perp^2}{B} \frac{(\mathbf{R}_c\times\mathbf{B})\cdot\nabla B}{R_c^2 B^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The fractional change in <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel \delta s\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{v_\parallel \delta s}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(v_\parallel \delta s) = \frac{1}{\delta s}\frac{\mathrm{d}\delta s}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{1}{v_\parallel}\frac{\mathrm{d}v_\parallel}{\mathrm{d}t}
\]</span></p>
<p>From the previous derivations we see that the these two terms cancel, so that <span class="math display">\[
v_\parallel \delta s = \textrm{constant}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is not exactly the same as saying that <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is constant, however. In taking the integral of <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel \delta s\)</span>, between the turning points, it may be that the turning points on <span class="math inline">\(\delta s^\prime\)</span> do not coincide with the intersections of the perpendicular planes. However, any error in <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> arising from such a discrepancy is negligible because near the turning points, <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> is nearly zero. Consequently, we have proved <span class="math display">\[
J = \int_a^b v_\parallel ds = \textrm{constant}
\]</span></p>
<p>An example of the violation of J invariance is given by a plasma heating scheme called <em>transit-time magnetic pumping</em>. Suppose an oscillating current is applied to the coils of a mirror system so that the mirrors alternately approach and withdraw from each other near the bounce frequency. Those particles that have the right bounce frequency will always see an approaching mirror and will therefore gain <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is not conserved in this case because the change of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> occurs on a time scale not long compared with the bounce time.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.8.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-third-adiabatic-invariant"><span class="header-section-number">4.8.6</span> The Third Adiabatic Invariant</h3>
<p>Referring again to the earth dipole case, we see that the slow drift of a guiding center around the earth constitutes a third type of periodic motion. The adiabatic invariant connected with this turns out to be the total magnetic flux <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> enclosed by the drift surface, <span id="eq-magnetic_flux"><span class="math display">\[
\Phi = \int\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
\tag{4.31}\]</span></span></p>
<p>It is almost obvious that, as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> varies, the particle will stay on a surface such that the total number of magnetic field lines enclosed remains constant. This invariant, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, has few applications because most fluctuations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> occur on a time scale short compared with the drift period. As an example of the violation of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> invariance, we can cite some recent work on the excitation of ultra-low frequency magnetohydrodynamic waves in the ionosphere. These waves have a long period comparable to the drift time of a particle around the earth. The particles can therefore encounter the wave in the same phase each time around. If the phase is right, the wave can be excited by the conversion of particle drift energy to wave energy.</p>
<p>Here are some time scales to remember for a 1 MeV electron/ion in the Earth’s radiation belt at L shell 4 from Solène Lejosne’s <a href="https://solenelejosne.com/bounce/">calculator</a>:</p>

<p>In radiation belt studies, it is typical to consider a quantity that is inversely proportional to the magnetic flux: <span id="eq-Lstar"><span class="math display">\[
L^\ast = \frac{2\pi M}{|\phi|R_E} = \frac{2\pi B_{eq}R_E^2}{|\phi|}
\tag{4.32}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the magnetic moment of the Earth’s dipole field, <span class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span> is the radius of the Earth, and <span class="math inline">\(B_{eq}\)</span> is the magnetic field strength at the equatorial surface. This presentation of the third invariant is termed <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span>, or Roederer’s <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> parameter, which is the radial distance to the equatorial point where the particle would be found if all nondipolar perturbations in the geomagnetic field were adiabatically turned off leaving only the dipole field (Roederer, 1970). It should be noted that in a nondipolar field <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span> does <em>not</em> represent a spatial coordinate, instead <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span> is a property of a stably trapped particle (Roederer and Lejosne, 2018). That is, in absence of acceleration or loss processes, <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span> defines a surface with constant phase space density. If a particle encounter a boundary of the radiation belt system (i.e.&nbsp;the magnetopause or atmosphere) during its drift leading to its loss from the system, the particle does not have an <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span> value. The particle is said to be in the drift loss cone.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span> parameters coincide in a dipole field, but in a nondipolar field, these parameters are different. Typically, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is used with particle fluxes whereas <span class="math inline">\(L^\ast\)</span> is better suited for phase space density. An interesting phenomenon from a nondipolar field is the <em>drift-shell splitting</em>, as been proposed as one of the mechanisms for causing the pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere (<a href="magnetosphere.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;18</span></a>).</p>

<h2 data-number="4.9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ring-current"><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Ring Current</h2>
<p>One typical application of the single particle motion is the study of ring current. Beyond the lowest order of motion (i.e.&nbsp;gyration combined with parallel drift) of charged particles in the magnetosphere, let us examine the higher order corrections. For the case of non-time-varying fields, and a weak electric field, these corrections consist of a combination of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift, grad-<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> drift, and curvature drift: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{1\perp} = \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2} + \frac{\mu}{m\Omega}\hat{b}\times\nabla B + \frac{v_\parallel^2}{\Omega}\hat{b}\times(\hat{b}\cdot\nabla)\hat{b}
\]</span></p>
<p>Let us neglect the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift, since this motion merely gives rise to the convection of plasma within the magnetosphere, without generating a current. By contrast, there is a net current associated with grad-<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> drift and curvature drift. In the limit in which this current does not strongly modify the ambient magnetic field (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\times\mathbf{B} \simeq \mathbf{0}\)</span>), which is certainly the situation in the Earth’s magnetosphere, we can write <span class="math display">\[
(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\,\mathbf{B} =-\mathbf{B}\times(\nabla\times \mathbf{B})\simeq \frac{\nabla_\perp B}{B}
\]</span></p>
<p>It follows that the higher order drifts can be combined to give <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{1\perp} = \frac{(v_\perp^{~2}/2+v_\parallel^{~2})}{{\Omega}\,B}\, \mathbf{B}\times\nabla B
\]</span></p>
<p>For the dipole field <a href="math.html#eq-dipole_spherical">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.4</span></a>, the above expression yields <span id="eq-high_order_drifts"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v}_{1\perp} \simeq -\mathrm{sgn}({\Omega})\,\frac{6\,\mathcal{E} L^2}{eB_E R_E}(1-B/2B_m)\frac{\cos^5\vartheta(1+\sin^2\vartheta)}{(1+3\sin^2\vartheta)^2}\,\hat{\varphi}
\tag{4.33}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> is the energy of the particle, <span class="math inline">\(B_E\)</span> is the equatorial magnetic field-strength on the Earth’s surface, and <span class="math inline">\(B_m\)</span> is the magnetic field-strength at the mirror points. Note that the drift is in the azimuthal direction. A positive drift velocity corresponds to eastward motion, whereas a negative velocity corresponds to westward motion. It is clear that, in addition to their gyromotion and periodic bouncing motion along field lines, charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere also slowly precess around the Earth. The ions drift westwards and the electrons drift eastwards, giving rise to a net westward current circulating around the Earth. This current is known as the <em>ring current</em>.</p>
<p>Although the perturbations to the Earth’s magnetic field induced by the ring current are small, they are still detectable. In fact, the ring current causes a slight reduction in the Earth’s magnetic field in equatorial regions. The size of this reduction is a good measure of the number of charged particles contained in the Van Allen belts (<a href="radiationbelt.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;20</span></a>). During the development of so-called geomagnetic storms, charged particles are injected into the Van Allen belts from the outer magnetosphere, giving rise to a sharp increase in the ring current, and a corresponding decrease in the Earth’s equatorial magnetic field. These particles eventually precipitate out of the magnetosphere into the upper atmosphere at high latitudes, giving rise to intense auroral activity, serious interference in electromagnetic communications, and, in extreme cases, disruption of electric power grids. The ring current induced reduction in the Earth’s magnetic field is measured by the so-called <em>Dst</em> index, which is based on hourly averages of the northward horizontal component of the terrestrial magnetic field recorded at four low-latitude observatories; Honolulu (Hawaii), San Juan (Puerto Rico), Hermanus (South Africa), and Kakioka (Japan). A reduction in the Dst index by 600 nT corresponds to a <span class="math inline">\(2\%\)</span> reduction in the terrestrial magnetic field at the equator.</p>
<p>According to <a href="#eq-high_order_drifts">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.33</span></a>, the precessional drift velocity of charged particles in the magnetosphere is a rapidly decreasing function of increasing latitude (i.e., most of the ring current is concentrated in the equatorial plane). Since particles typically complete many bounce orbits during a full rotation around the Earth, it is convenient to average <a href="#eq-high_order_drifts">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.33</span></a> over a bounce period to obtain the <em>average</em> drift velocity. This averaging can only be performed numerically. The final answer is well approximated by <span id="eq-drift_ring_current"><span class="math display">\[
\langle v_d\rangle \simeq \frac{6\,\mathcal{E}\,L^2}{e\,B_E\,R_E} \,(0.35 + 0.15\,\sin\alpha_\mathrm{eq})
\tag{4.34}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The average drift period (i.e., the time required to perform a complete rotation around the Earth) is simply <span class="math display">\[
\langle \tau_d\rangle = \frac{2\pi\,L\,R_E}{\langle v_d\rangle}\simeq\frac{\pi e B_E R_E^2}{3\,\mathcal{E}\,L}\,(0.35 + 0.15\,\sin\alpha_\mathrm{eq})^{-1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the drift period for protons and electrons is <span class="math display">\[
\langle \tau_d\rangle_p=\langle \tau_d\rangle_e \simeq \frac{1.05}{\mathcal{E}(\text{MeV})L}\,(1+0.43\,\sin\alpha_\mathrm{eq})^{-1}\,\,\,\mathrm{hours}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that MeV energy electrons and ions precess around the Earth with about the same velocity, only in opposite directions, because there is no explicit mass dependence in <a href="#eq-drift_ring_current">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.34</span></a>. It typically takes <span class="math inline">\(\sim 20\)</span> mins to perform a full rotation. The drift period only depends weakly on the equatorial pitch angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_\mathrm{eq}\)</span>, as is the case for the bounce period. Somewhat paradoxically, the drift period is shorter on more distant <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-shells. Note, of course, that particles only get a chance to complete a full rotation around the Earth if the inner magnetosphere remains quiescent on time-scales of order an hour, which is, by no means, always the case.</p>
<p>Note that since the rest mass of an electron is <span class="math inline">\(0.51\)</span> MeV, most of the above formulae require relativistic correction when applied to MeV energy electrons. Fortunately, however, there is no such problem for protons, whose rest mass energy is <span class="math inline">\(0.94\)</span> GeV.</p>
<p>Current theory suggests that the lower latitude (compared with the region I current) region II current is closely linked to the ring current, or more precisely, the partial ring current (substorm current wedge?) on the nightside. The ring current is generated from supra-thermal electrons and ions but not the thermal portion, thus requires extra care on the high energy tail distribution which may not be present in a model that only resolves the thermal part.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.10" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="particle-acceleration"><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Particle Acceleration</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Fermi acceleration</em> is the acceleration that charged particles undergo when being repeatedly reflected, usually by a magnetic mirror. This is sometimes referred to as <em>diffusive shock acceleration</em>, which is actually a subclass of Fermi acceleration. There are two types of Fermi acceleration: <em>first-order Fermi acceleration</em> (in shocks) and <em>second-order Fermi acceleration</em> (in the environment of moving magnetized gas clouds). In both cases the environment has to be collisionless in order for the mechanism to be effective. This is because Fermi acceleration only applies to particles with energies exceeding the thermal energies, and frequent collisions with surrounding particles will cause severe energy loss and as a result no acceleration will occur. See more in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_acceleration">wiki</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Betatron acceleration</em> refers to situations in which the magnetic field strength increases slowly in time (compared with a gyroperiod), so that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> remains constant, but the particle kinetic energy is not constant due to the presence of electric fields (associated with the time-varying magnetic field). Then, the perpendicular energy is increased due to constancy of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Shock drift acceleration</em>. Gradients within the shock transition region may give rise to the phenomenon of Shock Drift Acceleration (SDA), where ions travel along the shock front and gyrate through the ramp multiple times before either passing into the downstream or escaping into the upstream region. The sudden compression of the plasma creates complex electric field that can accelerate charged particles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Particle accelerations are important consequences of magnetic reconnection and shocks. In magnetic reconnection processes, the energy is rapidly converted from magnetic field to particles in the forms of flows, bulk (“thermal”) heating, and high-energy (“nonthermal”) tails. <span class="citation" data-cites="ji2022magnetic">(<a href="#ref-ji2022magnetic" role="doc-biblioref">Ji et al. 2022</a>)</span> describes the current understanding of electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection in the non-relativistic and relativistic regimes. First-principles numerical simulations suggest power-law nonthermal particle populations are more prevalent in systems with low <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and moderate guide (perpendicular to the reconnection plane) magnetic fields, with acceleration efficiency enhanced in 3D compared to simplified 2D calculations. Multiple acceleration mechanisms have been studied. In the localized diffusion region near an X-line without a guide field, particles may become demagnetized, prone to be directly accelerated by the reconnection electric field as they undergo so-called <em>Speiser</em> or <em>meandering orbits</em>. There is recent laboratory evidence for electron acceleration by this mechanism in action during magnetically driven reconnection at low-<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> using laser-powered capacitor coils. There is also numerical evidence that a substantial fraction of dissipated magnetic energy is carried by particles accelerated by this mechanism when they are demagnetized and escape from plasmoids in 3D.</p>
<p>Over larger scales when the particles remain magnetized, there are three basic particle acceleration processes that dominate in collisionless reconnection: <em>Fermi acceleration</em> which takes place as particles stream along and drift in relaxing curved magnetic field lines, relatively <em>localized electric fields</em> <span class="math inline">\(E_\parallel\)</span> parallel to the magnetic field directly accelerate particles, and <em>betatron heating</em> which occurs as particles drift into regions of stronger magnetic field while conserving the first adiabatic moment <span class="math inline">\(\mu=mv_\perp^2/B\)</span>. These mechanisms are described by guiding center equations of motion for the particles, and the energization rate in the non-relativistic limit is given approximately by the following equation: <span id="eq-particle_energization_nonrelativistic"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{E}}{dt} = qE_\parallel v_\parallel + \mu\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} + q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{u}_c + \frac{1}{2}m\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}|\mathbf{u}_E|^2
\tag{4.35}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> is the energy of a particle, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}_E\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> drift velocity, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}_E\cdot\nabla\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_\parallel\)</span> is the parallel electric field, and <span class="math inline">\(v_\parallel\)</span> is the drift-corrected guiding center parallel velocity. For slowly varying fields, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}_c\)</span> is the curvature drift of particles and reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}_c \sim(mv_\parallel^2/qB)(\hat{b}\times\pmb{\kappa})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\kappa}=\hat{b}\cdot\nabla\hat{b}\)</span> is the magnetic field curvature and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> is the unit vector in the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>. The terms on the right-hand side represent energy gain by the parallel electric field, betatron heating, Fermi acceleration, and the polarization drift respectively. The first three mechanisms are sketched in <a href="#fig-particle_acceleration_reconnection">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.4</span></a>. The polarization drift is particularly important for lower-energy ions, and this terms accounts for the kinetic energy gain in the large-scale reconnection outflow jets. Although <a href="#eq-particle_energization_nonrelativistic">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.35</span></a> is valid in the non-relativistic limit, the same basic acceleration mechanisms are responsible for energizing particles in more extreme relativistic contexts relevant to astrophysical systems.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;4.4: Illustration of particle acceleration mechanisms. The reconnection electric field is along the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction. Acceleration by the reconnection electric field occurs near the X-line, which is associated with the Speiser orbit, and by parallel electric field near separatrices, which are boundaries between upstream (before-reconnection) and downstream (after-reconnection) regions. When particles near the X-line interact with the parallel electric field, ions (electrons) are accelerated along the (opposite) direction of the field, and the direct acceleration term <span class="math inline">\(qE_\parallel v_\parallel\)</span> (the first term on the right side of <a href="#eq-particle_energization_nonrelativistic">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.35</span></a>) is positive. The betatron acceleration mechanism happens when particles flow into the stronger magnetic field regions in the exhaust. In this example trajectory, particles move along the positive z direction by the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> motion and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span> is also along the positive z direction. As a result, the second term of <a href="#eq-particle_energization_nonrelativistic">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.35</span></a> is positive. Fermi acceleration occurs in the regions with high-curvature magnetic field lines. In this example, plasmoids are elongated along the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> direction, such that the field lines have the highest curvature at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>. Inside the plasmoid, particles obtain a large velocity kick along the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction due to a large curvature drift and obtain a significant energy from the reconnection electric field (<span class="math inline">\(q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{u}_c &gt; 0\)</span>). In the exhaust region, trapped particles gain energy whenever they pass the high curvature regions at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>. di is ion skin depth.

<p>Particles gain energy when their drift induced by the curvature of the magnetic field lines is aligned with the reconnection electric field, which is a form of Fermi heating. Fermi acceleration may resolve two major challenges for heating models. First, it may operate over large volumes in the presence of many magnetic islands or plasmoids, which may be sampled by electrons in the presence of 3D ergodic field lines. There are several space observations of energetic electrons near magnetic islands or plasmoids. Second, the Fermi process naturally generates power laws because a particle undergoing Fermi acceleration gains energy at a rate proportional to its energy, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\mathcal{E}\propto \mathcal{E}\)</span>. In the non-relativistic limit, adiabatic particle energization by Fermi acceleration along with the other heating mechanisms for magnetized particles leads to a Parker-like transport equation for the distribution <span class="math inline">\(f(v_\parallel, v_\perp)\)</span> of particles within a magnetic flux tube including time-varying plasma density <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>: <span id="eq-parker_transport"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{\dot{B}}{B}v_\perp^2\frac{\partial f}{\partial v_\perp^2} + \left( \frac{\dot{n}}{n} - \frac{\dot{B}}{B} \right)v_\parallel\frac{\partial f}{\partial v_\parallel} = \frac{D\{ f \}}{\tau_\text{diff}} - \frac{f}{\tau_\text{esc}} + \frac{f_\text{inj}}{\tau_\text{inj}}
\tag{4.36}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{D\{ f \}}{\tau_\text{diff}}\)</span> includes diffusive processes such as pitch-angle or energy scattering, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_\text{esc}\)</span> is a typical time for particles to escape the reconnection geometry, and <span class="math inline">\(f_\text{inj}/\tau_\text{inj}\)</span> is a source of newly injected particles. This transport equation leads to power-law solutions under certain assumptions, though the Fermi process becomes much less effective at generating power-law nonthermal tails in the presence of a significant guide magnetic field component. With certain assumptions, it is possible to solve the Parker equation using the velocity and magnetic fields from MHD simulations to obtain predictions of the particle acceleration, but this approach does not include the self-consistent feedback.</p>

<p>The test particle method is not self-consistent, because we only describe the effect of the fields onto particles, but not vice versa. This reduces the PDEs to ODEs which is much simpler to solve. Despite of this, we use the trajectories of test particles to infer approximate kinetic properties of the system. You will see many examples of understanding more complicated scenario using the drifts derived from test particle motions, especially in terms of stability analysis.</p>
<p>There are four methods in test particle modelling:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Trajectory sampling. It solves individual particle trajectories, but it may not be trivial to select the samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Forward Monte Carlo. We inject particles in source regions where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is known, and follow them until they reach the regions of interest. This is similar to PIC, except that the fields are not self-consistent.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Forward Liouville</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Backward Liouville</em>. It also makes use of the Liouville’s theorem for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, but there is no sampling, neither in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> nor in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> space, implying no statistical errors. The procedure starts by choosing a given point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> in space …</p></li>
