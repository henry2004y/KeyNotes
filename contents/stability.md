# Stability {#sec:stability}

This chapter discusses plasma equilibrium and stability, or more precisely, instability. We are interested in when, where, and how instabilities arise in plasmas.

First, let us have an intuitive inspection from the energy principle.
In classical mechanics, we learn that motion acts to lower the energy in the system. For the simplest Rayleigh-Taylor instability between two fluids with different density, we can easily decide if there is an instability by checking the total potential energy change. In a current-carrying plasma, similar motions can be developed. The energy can be expressed as

$$
W=\frac{1}{2}LI^2
$$

where $L$ is the inductance and $I$ is the current. The magnetic flux can be written as

$$
\Phi = LI
$$

so the energy can also be written as

$$
W=\frac{\Phi^2}{2L}
$$

The relation between magnetic flux and current is similar to charge and voltage, $Q=CV$, where $C$ is the electric capacity. In a system where magnetic flux $\Phi$ is conserved (e.g. ideal MHD), plasma lowers its potential by increasing its inductance $L$. Check [@bellan2008fundamentals] P315.

## Single Particle Motion Implication on Instabilities

This section provides some qualitative understanding of instabilities in plasma. Thinking of instabilities from the prospective of single particle motion provides us the physical intuition of the causes and development of instabilities from a very basic level.

_Equilibrium stability of a plasma from $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ and gradient-curvature drift_

A key problem in nuclear fusion is to confine plasma. In the first stage, we need current loops around a torus tube (figure needed!) to provide a toroidal magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_t$ along the torus. Let us take a look at a torus cut. (figure needed!) $\nabla B_0$ is pointing towards the inside. $\mathbf{B}_0$ points outside the plane, so the gradient-curvature drift will lead electrons upward and ions downward, which in turn creates a E field pointing upwards. $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift then will lead both electrons and ions towards the outer boundary. Eventually we will lose the plasma. One way to fix this is to add $\mathbf{J}_t$, an internal plasma current in the toroidal direction to generate a poloidal $\mathbf{B}_p$, so that the magnetic field is stronger on the boundary than that at the center.  In this way the total magnetic field becomes a helix.

Consider the poloidal magnetic field generated by $\mathbf{J}_t$. One step further, our question is: will the plasma tube be stable under infinitesimal perturbations to the ideal cylinder configuration? The answer is no. Imagine a small perturbation shown as in Fig.\ref{fig:kink}. On the convex side, $\nabla B$ points downward, so the gradient-curvature drift will lead ions to the right and electrons to the left, which in turn generates a E field pointing right to left. Thereafter the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift will further drag the plasma to the convex region, and the whole system can never return to equilibrium. This current-carrying plasma instability is called \emph{kink instability}. The situation described here is sometimes referred to as linear kink instability. The kink mode can carry currents. Another similar mode is the sausage instability as shown in @fig:kink_sausage. Also note that a sufficiently strong $B_z$ can stabilize these instabilities.

Another famous instability is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In fluid dynamics, Rayleigh-Taylor instability happens due to gravity. Here in plasma physics, the role of gravity force is replaced by the EM force. Imagine a situation where plasma are located at $z>0$ region, below which is a vacuum space. There is a B field pointing outside the plane while $\nabla B$ is pointing upwards ( $B_{\text{up}}>B_{\text{down}}$). Due to gradient drift on the boundary, ions will move to the left while electrons will move to the right, where a E field pointing left to right is created. Thus the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift will lead plasma from upper region to lower region, and eventually breaks the interface. (Actually I have some questions for this figure: it seems to me that it is impossible to decide which part of the interface is changing first?)

## MHD Modes

A simple but representative dispersion relation writes

$$
\omega^2=(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{V}_A)^2-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{g},\quad \text{where }\mathbf{V}_A=\frac{\mathbf{B}_0}{B_0}\cdot V_A
$$

If we treat plasma as a single magnetized fluid,

$$
\rho\Big( \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\underbrace{\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla \mathbf{u}}_{\textrm{K-H inst.}} \Big)=\underbrace{-\nabla p}_{\text{ballooning inst.}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{B}}_{\text{kink, sausage inst.}}+\underbrace{\rho\mathbf{g}}_{\text{R-T inst.}}
$$

Qualitatively, we can identify the source for each kind of instability in plasma. We will discuss them separately and in a set of combination below.

### Kink Mode

A kink instability, is a _current-driven_ plasma instability characterized by transverse displacements of a plasma column's cross-section from its center of mass without any change in the characteristics of the plasma. It typically develops in a thin plasma column carrying a strong axial current which exceeds the [Kruskal–Shafranov limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_factor_(plasma_physics)) and is sometimes known as the Kruskal–Shafranov (kink) instability.

The kink instability was first widely explored in fusion power machines with Z-pinch configurations in the 1950s. It is one of the common magnetohydrodynamic instability modes which can develop in a pinch plasma and is sometimes referred to as the $m=1$ mode.

If a "kink" begins to develop in a column the magnetic forces on the inside of the kink become larger than those on the outside, which leads to growth of the perturbation. As it develops at fixed areas in the plasma, kinks belong to the class of "absolute plasma instabilities", as opposed to convective processes.

### Sausage Mode

The $m=0$ mode known as the sausage instability.

### Ballooning Mode

The ballooning instability is a type of internal pressure-driven plasma instability usually seen in tokamak fusion power reactors or in space plasmas [@hameiri1991ballooning]. It is important in fusion research as it determines a set of criteria for the maximum achievable plasma beta. The name refers to the shape and action of the instability, which acts like the elongations formed in a long balloon when it is squeezed. In literature, the structure of these elongations are commonly referred to as "fingers".

The narrow fingers of plasma produced by the instability are capable of accelerating and pushing aside the surrounding magnetic field in order to cause a sudden, explosive release of energy. Thus, the instability is also known as the explosive instability.

The interchange instability can be derived from the equations of the ballooning instability as a special case in which the ballooning mode does not perturb the equilibrium magnetic field.[@hameiri1991ballooning] This special limit is known as the Mercier criterion.
