# Capacitance {#sec-capacitance}

A capacitor is a little like a battery but works completely differently. A battery is an electronic device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy, whereas a capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores electrostatic energy in an electric field.

## What Is a Capacitor?

A capacitor is a two-terminal electrical device that can store energy in the form of an electric charge. It consists of two electrical conductors that are separated by a distance.  The space between the conductors may be filled by vacuum or with an insulating material known as a dielectric. The ability of the capacitor to store charges is known as capacitance.

Capacitors store energy by holding apart pairs of opposite charges. The simplest design for a capacitor is a parallel plate, which consists of two metal plates with a gap between them. But, different types of capacitors are manufactured in many forms, styles, lengths, girths, and materials.
